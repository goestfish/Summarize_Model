A technique to measure microscopic rotational motion is pre sented. When a small ﬂuorescent polystyrene
microsphere is attached to a larger polystyrene microspher e, the larger sphere acts as a lens for the smaller
microsphere and provides anoptical signal that isa strong f unction of the azimuthal angle. We demonstrate the
technique by measuring the rotational diffusion constant o f the microsphere in solutions of varying viscosity
and discuss the feasibilityof usingthis probe tomeasure ro tational motion of biological systems.
The commercial development of precision microspheres
withwellcontrolledsizesandvariousproteincoatingshas en-
abled a number of new devices and experimental techniques,
frombeingthecomponentpartsinthefabricationofphotoni c
crystals[1]totheiruseas“handles”foropticaltweezersi nthe
studyofsingleprotein[2,3]andDNAmolecules[4]. Herewe
describetheuseofmicrosphereswithstreptavidin-biotin coat-
ing to self assemble a microscopic lensing system that can in
turnbeusedtomeasurerotation.
Previous biological experimentsto measure rotational mo-
tions used a “tethered cell” assay in which a single ﬂagellum
is attached to a surface and the cell rotates [5–7], or a “ro-
tating ﬁlament” assay by attaching long actin [8] ﬁlaments t o
an ATPase molecule or microtubule[9] ﬁlaments to a dynein
molecule. Both these assays rely on imagingthe probeto de-
termineorientation,limitingthetimeresolutiontovideo rates
ontheorderof10Hz.
Althoughit isinferredfromtheswimmingspeedofmicro-
organisms that bacterial ﬂagella can turn at a top rotationa l
speed of 100,000RPM [10], measurement techniquescannot
keep up with those rates. Measurements are typically made
byforcingtheﬂagellatoturnalargemomentofinertiawhich
slows the rotation rate to the region where it is accessible t o
video analysis. Similarly, in studies of F 1-ATPase, the rota-
tion rate is slowed to an observable level by increasing the
hydrodynamic drag that it must oppose. However, the ro-
tation is likely to be fundamentally at a constant angle per
ATP hydrolized, as shown by [11,12], and slowing the rota-
tion by increasing drag results in some elastic storage of en -
ergy. Methods are needed that have the potential to observe
high-frequencyrotationsandhaveless hydrodynamicdrag.
Thispaperpresentsamethodtomeasurehighfrequencyro-
tationalmotion. An asymmetricﬂuorescentprobeis madeby
attaching a small ﬂuorescently labeled polymer microspher e
to a larger polymer microsphere. The larger sphere acts as a
lens, substantially enhancing the collection efﬁciency of the
optical system. The experiment is outlined in the inset of
Fig.1.FIG. 1. The optical ray tracing of the two microspheres. This
diagram deﬁnes the angles θ,θ′,θ′′,φ,φ′and the distances rand
δ. The ray originally starts at an angle θto the vertical and after
passing through the lensing microsphere continues on at an a ngle
φ′−θ′′. The index of refraction of the water is n1= 1.3and for
the polystyrene microsphere is n2= 1.59. Inset: The ﬂuorescence
collectedfrom anobjective withﬁnite NA isenhanced whenth e mi-
crosphere pair isaligned withthe optical collectionaxis.
We can show that the system increases the amount of col-
lected light with a geometric optics argument. The angles of
ray tracing are outlined in Fig. 1; we would like to calculate
the exit angle φ′−θ′′as a function of the incident angle θ.
Thesmall ﬂuorescentmicrosphereis approximatedasa point

ometry,notethat
φ′=π−(π−2θ′+φ) = 2θ′−φ. (1)

Then, by direct substitution of equation (3) into equation ( 2),
we ﬁndthat
θ′′=φ+θ. (4)
Usingthelaw ofsines,we canwrite

and then explicitly ﬁnd the angle φas a function of r,θ, and
δ:

Finally, we can write the exit angle φ′−θ′′in terms of the
original angle, θ, the radii of the two spheres, r,δ, and the
indicesofrefraction, n1andn2.

Forδ≪r, we note that φ≪θ. The exit angle is then given
by

θ. This gives an exit angle of 0.64θfor
a ray entering at an angle θ. Since the exit angle is always
less than the original angle, we conclude that the lensing mi -
crosphere focuses rays from the ﬂuorescent microsphere and
enhancestheopticalsignal.
The enhancement in the observed optical signal also de-
pendson the numericalapertureof the objective. Thenumer-
ical aperture (NA) is deﬁned as NA =nsinθo, whereθois
the collection angle. For our objective (20 ×, 0.4 NA) in air
θo= 23.6◦. Equation(8)showsthatthefocusingmicrosphere
increases the angle of collection to 43.5◦. This corresponds
to an effective NA of 0.69. The epi-ﬂuorescent intensity is
proportional to NA4, so we expect an intensity enhancement
of(0.69/0.4)4≈9times; this is of the order of what we
observed. Objectives with high NA collect almost all of the
emitted light, and thus we would not expect to see any ﬂuo-
rescentenhancementfromahighNA objective. Observations
made with a 40 ×, 1.30NA oil immersion objective indicate
nonoticeableintensityenhancement.
To construct this system we used the biotin/streptavidin
binding system. Biotin is known to bind streptavidin witha very high afﬁnity [13]. We obtained streptavidin coated
microspheres from Interfacial Dynamics (polystyrene at a
volume concentration of 2.6%, 1.1 µm diameter) and biotin
coated yellow-green ﬂuorescent microspheres (polystyren e
1% by volume, 0.2 µm diameter, excitation maximum at
505nm, emmission maximum at 515nm) from Molecular
Probes. The smaller microspheres were diluted by a factor
of 1000 in distilled water. A volume of 10 µl of this solution
was added to 10 µl of the large microspheres and allowed to
incubateat roomtemperatureforapproximatelyﬁveminutes .
The solutionwas then dilutedby a factor of 104in either dis-

over approximately 30 microspheres measured over approxim ately

of the circles marking the data points. The solid lines repre sent ﬁts

typical data from a single microsphere ( η≈4cP) over 18 seconds.

The solution was placed on a microscope slide with cov-
erslip and the edges were sealed with a clear nail polish to
prevent any evaporation or ﬂuid ﬂow. These specimens were
examined on a Nikon ﬂuorescent microscope with a 20 ×,
0.4NAobjective. Thelensingmicrosphereisundergoingcon -
stant rotational diffusion, and when the attached ﬂuoresce nt
microsphereisalignedwiththeopticalcollectionaxisthe ob-
servedintensityissubstantiallylargerthaninotherposi tions.
Images of these intensity ﬂuctuations were observed using
a CCD camera and recorded on video tape. The sequence of
videoimageswasanalyzedbydigitizingthemwithaPC.The
microspheres’ ﬂuorescent intensities were measured in eac h
frame. Data with better time resolution could be obtained by
using a photodiode to observe single microspheres, but the

microspherepairsin parallel.
From the intensity ﬂuctuations we can compute the prob-
abilityP(t)that the intensity is above a threshold at time t,
giventhattheintensitywasabovethisthresholdattime t= 0.
P(t)can in turn be calculated from ﬁrst principles. The rota-
tional motion of the lensing microsphere can be decomposed
intoorthogonalazimuthalandpolardirections. Sinceonly the
azimuthal angle contributes to the intensity enhancement, it
sufﬁcesto considera onedimensionalproblem. Let αdenote

In practice this was approximated numerically using just
the largest terms of the series (|n| ≤3). Then= 0term is

tion and integrating it using a trapezoid algorithm [15]. Th e
higher order terms were computed using the approximation
that the initial conditionwas p(θ,0) =δ(θ)(the solution is a
gaussian function) and the integration was carried out as th e
valueofthe functiontimesthewidth.
The data can therefore be ﬁt to a two parameter function
P(t)that is characterized by the angle αand the rotational
diffusion coefﬁcient Dr. The angle αis determined by the

The microlensing can be explained with geometric optics; a
completetheorywill needtotakeintoaccountnearﬁeldopti -
cal effects. The microlensing was observed experimentally
and used to measure the rotational diffusion constant of asphere. This mechanism may have applications in studies of
biomolecularrotations and ﬂuid dynamics, especially in si tu-
ations with a high rotational rate. For a rotation at a consta nt
rate, the load can be adjusted by changing both the viscosity
of the ﬂuid and size of the larger microsphere. Precision mi-
crospheres are commercially available with diameters of le ss
than1µm to greaterthan 100 µmgivinga rangeof loadsthat
