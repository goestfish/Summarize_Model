Abstract
In this manuscript, we describe a new conﬁgurational bias Monte Ca rlo technique for
the simulation of peptides. We focus on the biologically relevant cases of linear and cyclic
peptides. Our approach leads to an eﬃcient, Boltzmann-weighted s ampling of the torsional
degrees of freedom in these biological molecules, a feat not possible with previous Monte
Carlo and molecular dynamics methods.

1 Introduction
This paper presents a new Monte Carlo method that employs biased t rial moves to achieve
an eﬃcient sampling of the torsional degrees of freedom for linear a nd cyclic peptides.
Peptides are small molecules, built from amino acids, that are of fund amental impor-
tance in biological systems [1]. They play key roles in signal transduct ion between cells,
regulation of cell growth and diﬀerentiation, and protein localization on cell surfaces [2].
Peptides are thought to regulate neurotransmission, from modula ting pain and thirst to
aﬀecting memory and emotion [3, 4]. They are used as a chemical defe nse mechanism by
some organisms. The conussnails, for example, produce a family of highly-constrained
peptides that include very powerful neurotoxins [5]. Finally, peptide s are used within the
biotechnology industry to identify antagonists blocking various abn ormal enzymatic ac-
tions or ligand-receptor interactions [6]. Cyclic or otherwise constr ained peptides are often
preferred for this application, since such molecules suﬀer less of a lo ss of conﬁgurational
entropy upon binding [7]. A classic example is the use of the RGD peptide to block the
GPIIb/IIIa-ﬁbronectin interaction, reducing blood platelet aggr egation [8, 9].
The properties of peptides are amenable to examination by compute r experiment. An
early study was of the alanine dipeptide, in which the potential energ y surface was de-
duced from ab initio quantum mechanical calculations [10, 11]. Larger peptides have bee n
examined by classical simulations. Both molecular dynamics [12] and Mo nte Carlo [13]
approaches have proven useful. The eﬀects of the aqueous envir onment have been incorpo-
rated by simple dielectric theory [14, 15, 16, 17] or by explicit inclusion of water molecules
[18].
It has become clear, however, that the standard molecular dynam ics and Monte Carlo
methods are not capable of sampling all conformational degrees of freedom accessible at
body temperature to the larger peptides. This problem is particular ly evident for the im-
portant case of constrained peptides. Various solutions, such as high-temperature molec-
ular dynamics [19, 20] or simpliﬁed force ﬁelds [20, 21], have been sugg ested, but these
approaches suﬀer from uncontrolled approximations. A simulation m ethod able to sample
the relevant conformational states of peptides, particularly con strained ones, or exposed
loops of larger proteins would be of great value. It would aid study of these molecules in bi-
ologicalsystems aswell asfacilitatestructuralunderstanding of thepeptides andantibodies
of interest to the biotechnology industry.

Recently, powerful Monte Carlo methods have been developed tha t have a greatly en-
hanced sampling eﬃciency [22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. These met hods have been
applied to chain molecules at low and high density [24, 30] and even at ph ase coexistence
[31, 32, 33, 34]. These methods all use importance sampling, or biase d moves, to eﬃciently
explore the free energy landscape.

of this method over conventional molecular dynamics and Monte Car lo is demonstrated.

2 Monte Carlo Method
Wemake thesimplifying assumption that the intramolecular potential energy contains only
torsional and non-bonded terms. That is, bond lengths and angles are ﬁxed, and rotation
is allowed only about sigma bonds. At room- or body-temperature, t hese are fairly good
assumptions. They could easily be relaxed, although sampling the incr eased degrees of
freedom would entail a computational expense. Appendix A describ es the rigid fragments
that occur in peptides under these assumptions. A suitable form fo r the interatomic po-
tential would be the AMBER [35], ECCEP [36], or CHARMm [37] force ﬁeld. We pick
the AMBER potentials. Water is treated in an implicit way, assuming the dielectric con-
stant for Coulomb interactions is given by ǫ/ǫ0= 4r, withrgiven in ˚Angstroms. These
assumptions allow the method to be presented without a discussion o f detailed force ﬁeld
issues. The method is generically applicable to better force ﬁelds and an explicit treatment
of water.
A conﬁgurational bias Monte Carlo (CBMC) technique is used to explo re the conforma-
tions of the molecules. We describe the algorithm for both linear and c yclic peptides. By
cyclic, we mean peptides constrained because of disulﬁde bonds bet ween cystine residues.
There are two types of atoms in a peptide, those in the side chains an d those in the
backbone. Consequently, there are two types of Monte Carlo mov es: type I moves change
the positions of side chain atoms only, and type II moves change the positions of backbone
atoms, rigidly rotating the attached side chains. The type I move is a n extension of the
4
chain-molecule CBMC [24, 25] to the structurally more complicated ca se of peptides. The
type I move is applicable to side chains with a free end ( i.e.all naturally occurring amino
acid side chains except for proline). The backbone to which the side c hain is attached can
be either linear or cyclic. In the cyclic case, the type I move is also use d to change the
conﬁguration of the free ends of the main chain.
TherearetwokindsoftypeIImovesforthebackbone: typeIIam ovesforlinearpeptides
and type IIb moves for cyclic peptides. The type IIa move is essent ially the same as a type
I move. The side-chain residues that are attached to the backbon e are rigidly rotated so
as to remain properly bonded to the C αatoms in their new positions. When the peptide
is cyclic, we use a type IIb move to change the conﬁguration of part of the backbone loop,
rigidly rotating any side chains or free ends of the peptide that are a ttached to that part of
the backbone. The backbone of a cyclic peptide includes the atoms a long the main chain
as well as the C βand S atoms of the cystines participating in the disulﬁde bond. This
move requires a concerted rotation of the backbone torsional an gles with a rigid rotation
of the attached side groups. This concerted rotation of the tors ional angles is an extension
of the concerted rotation scheme for alkanes [22, 28].
A type I move is initiated by identifying the side chain to be regrown. No t all of the side
chain need be regrown, and the ﬁrst group to regrow is chosen. Th is feature is helpful for
the amino acids with longer side chains, such as lysine. These choices a re made randomly.
TheMrigid units to be regrown are ﬁrst removed and then added one at a t ime, starting
from the one closest to the backbone. For each addition, the follow ing actions are carried
out (see Fig. 1):
1)kvalues of the torsional angle φij,1≤j≤kconnecting rigid unit ito uniti−1 are
generated according to the internal potential,
pint
i(φij)∝exp[−βuint
i(φij)]. (1)
The function uint
i(φij) is the part of the internal energy that couples unit ito the rest of the
molecule (but excluding units i+1 toM). The inverse temperature is given by β= 1/kBT.
2) One of these is picked with probability
pext
i(φij) = exp[−βuext
i(φij)]/wext(i), (2)
where
wext(i) =k/summationdisplay
j=1exp[−βuext
i(φij)]. (3)
5
The function uext
i(φij) is the part of the external energy that couples unit ito the rest of
the molecule (but excluding units i+1 toM).
3) Steps 1-2 are repeated until all M units have been added.
4) The Rosenbluth weight
W(n)=M/productdisplay
i=1wext(i) (4)
is calculated. This attempted move is accepted with a probability
acc(o→n) = min[1,W(n)/W(o)]. (5)
The quantity W(o)is the Rosenbluth weight for the reverse move and is calculated as in
steps 2-4, but with k−1 random orientations and one orientation that is equal to the
original geometry for each rigid unit.
A type IIa move is very similar to a type I move. In this case, the direc tion of regrowth
is chosen randomly. Then the ﬁrst backbone unit to be regrown is ch osen. The Mrigid
units to be regrown are removed and added back sequentially, as in t he type I move. The
rigid units in this case are either A-units, B-units with the side chain rig idly attached, C-
units, or D-units (see appendix A). An alternative procedure would be to regrow the side
chain units as well, but this proved not to be eﬃcient, due to frequen t steric repulsions.
The move is accepted with the probability given by Eq. (5).
A type IIb move is initiated by identifying the 4 rigid units on the backbo ne to be
rotated. This is done randomly. The four rigid units are labeled in an am ine to carboxy
terminal fashion. The attached side groups are rigidly rotated with the backbone units.
The rotation is carried out as follows (see Fig. 2):
1) The driver angle φ0is changed by an amount δφ0, where−∆φ<δφ 0<∆φ. This is
donek′times with probabilities according to the internal potential,
pint(φ0j)∝exp[−βuint
0(φ0j)]. (6)
Thefunction uint
0(φ0j)istheinternal energyassociatedwiththistorsionalangle. Onlyth ose
values ofφ0that lead to valid solutions for the modiﬁed torsional angles are cons idered. In
the general case there will be a distinct φ1for each solution arising from the new value of
φ0. Deﬁnek(n)to be the number of φ0-φ1pairs. Ifk(n)= 0, the move is rejected.
2) Aφ0-φ1pair is picked with probability
pext
0(φ0j,φ1j) = exp[−βuext
0(φ0j,φ1j)]/W(n), (7)
6
where
W(n)=k(n)/summationdisplay
j=1exp[−βuext
0(φ0j,φ1j)]. (8)
The function uext
0(φ0j,φ1j) is the part of the external energy that couples this part of the
backbone to the rest of the molecule. The value J(n)of the Jacobian is calculated for the
new, chosen conﬁguration (as detailed in Appendix B).
3) The reverse move is considered. That is, a rotation about the ne w, chosenφ0-φ1pair
is considered. k′−1 random values δφ0are chosen. The original value of φ0is assigned to
thek′th value. This move results in k(o)solutions for φ1.k(o)is always greater than zero,
since the original conﬁguration exists. (Special care is taken to en sure that the original
conﬁguration is found by the root ﬁnding procedure.) The Rosenblu th weight is assigned
toW(o). The value J(o)of the Jacobian is also calculated for the original conﬁguration.
This attempted move is accepted with a probability
acc(o→n) = min[1,J(n)W(n)/J(o)W(o)]. (9)
Splitting the energy into internal and external parts is rather arb itrary. There are
some constraints imposed, however, by the requirement that the normalization constants
for Eqs. (1) and (6) be independent of chain conformation [26]. We a ssume for simplicity
thatuint
i= 0. One other natural choice, however, would set the internal pa rt equal to the
torsional terms in Hintraand set the external part equal to the rest of H.

3 Application to Polyglycine
In this section we present the result of applying this conﬁgurationa l bias Monte Carlo
method to two simple peptides, polyglycine G 6and constrained polyglycine CG 6C.
Figure 3 shows the energy of linear polyglycine as a function of Monte Carlo steps. This
run took roughly 3 hours on a Silicon Graphics Indigo2. In Fig. 4 we show the end-to-end
probability distribution for this system. Gaining this degree of conve rgence took a one-day
run.
Figure 5 illustrates the energy of the cyclic polyglycine as a function o f Monte Carlo
steps. This run took roughly 6 hours. Figure 6 provides a histogram of the number
7
of solutions found for each attempted concerted rotation. In ra re cases the root ﬁnding
procedure failed to ﬁnd all the roots. In the construction of this p lot, we rounded n(n)
up when it was odd. Figure 7 shows the histogram for the C βSSCβdihedral angle, with
the statistics taken from a run six times as long as that illustrated in F ig. 5. To give
a feel for the barrier to rotation about this angle, we show in Fig. 8 t he potential of
mean force. This potential was determined by umbrella sampling [38]. T his curve took
two orders of magnitude longer to determine than did the probability distribution in Fig.
7. The potential of mean force is contrasted with the energy asso ciated purely with the
CβSSCβtorsional terms. Finally, Fig. 9 shows the result of classifying the co nﬁgurations
produced by the method into distinct stable conformations. Fuzzy clustering [39] was used
to determine the dominant conformations, with the result that the re are only two or three
distinct conformations within this limited simulation run. The simulation r un depicted in
Figs. 5 and 9 took approximately 8 hours on a Silicon Graphics Indigo2.
4 Discussion
We see that with a very modest computational eﬀort, we can achiev e equilibrated results
for linear peptides. With somewhat more eﬀort, we can achieve equilib ration for cyclic
peptides.
As expected, we ﬁnd that the linear peptide G 6is relatively unstructured in solution.
Thereisacommoncrumpled state, butthereisalsoasigniﬁcant popu lationoftheextended
state. The constraint of the disulﬁde bond in CG 6C, in contrast, forces that molecule to
adopt a limited number of molecular conformations. For the fairly sho rt runs illustrated
in Figs. 5,6,7 and 9, we ﬁnd only three dominant conformations. The ﬁr st conformation is
associated with the C βSSCβtorsional angle of 290◦, whereas the other two are associated
with angles of 88◦and 98◦. The ﬁrst of these conformations is very tight, with 0.7 ˚A
ﬂuctuations about the mean for all atoms in the molecule. The other two are somewhat
looser, with roughly 1.2 ˚A ﬂuctuations. We see from Fig. 9 that even in this short run the
method revisits previous conformations. In the limit of a long simulatio n, the time spent in
each conformation would, of course, be proportional to the expo nential of the free energy
of the conformation.
If CG6C were achiral, the potential of mean force in Fig. 8 would be symmetr ic about
0◦and 180◦. Since the C αcarbons in the cystine residues are, in fact, chiral, the potential
of mean force is not required to be symmetric. The asymmetry seen in Fig. 8 results from
8
the mean, chiral force of the rest of the molecule on the C βSSCβtorsion. In fact, the
AMBER forceﬁeld takes this chirality into account by reducing the sy mmetry of the C β
carbon in cysteine. We have used this geometry [40]. The barrier at 0◦is due to a high
steric repulsion between the hydrogens on the C βcarbons adjacent to the disulﬁde bond.
This barrier is substantially higher than the barrier at 180◦.
From Fig. 8, we see that there is a very signiﬁcant free energy barr ier to rotation about
the C βSSCβtorsional angle. This ﬁgure was not constructed from a standard simula-
tion run, but by the specialized procedure of umbrella sampling. It is c lear from Fig. 7,
however, that the present method is able to overcome this barrier and to properly sam-
ple the relevant conformations even in a relatively short simulation. A ny method such as
molecular dynamics or standard Monte Carlo that makes only small, loc al changes to the
conﬁguration would never cross this barrier in a simulation of reason able length. High
temperature dynamics can allow systems to cross high barriers, bu t can not perform the
requisite Boltzmann sampling to predict the physiologically relevant co nformations. Only
a biased method that makes fairly large geometrical changes is capa ble of dealing with
such barriers in an automatic way, without resort to special techn iques such as umbrella
sampling. Furthermore, the ability to perform umbrella sampling has a s a prerequisite
the detailed knowledge of the important conformations and the pat hs between them. In
our speciﬁc case, we ﬁnd our method to be two orders of magnitude more eﬃcient than
umbrella sampling.
5 Conclusion
We have presented a Monte Carlo method capable of sampling the rele vant room- or body-
temperature conﬁgurations of linear and cyclic peptides. This meth od allows the study of
peptides important in biological and technological settings. Our sam pling of the disulﬁde
dihedral angle in a prototypical cyclic peptide indicates that the met hod can explore widely
separated regions of conformation space according to the prope r Boltzmann distribution,
even if the barriers between the regions are quite large. Previous s imulation methods either
fail to sample the proper thermal distribution or are vastly more co mputationally intensive
and require detailed knowledge of the thermally accessible regions. T he method can be
extended to allow incorporation of explicit water molecules. The meth od can be extended
to force ﬁelds with ﬂexible bonds andangles. These extensions are s ubjects for future work.

Appendix A: Rigid Units
As described, the algorithm assumes that bond lengths and angles a re ﬁxed. The only
degrees offreedom, therefore, aretorsionalangles. Duetoth eextremely highforceconstant
forrotationabouta πbond,evensometorsionalanglesareﬁxedaswell. Anentirecollectio n
of atoms that is rigid is called a rigid unit. Such a unit has an incoming bond as well as
several possible outgoing bonds. There are four backbone rigidun its. Unit A is the starting
NH+
3group. Unit D is the terminal COO−group. Unit B is the C αH group. Unit C is the
CONH amide bond group.
The residues are connected to the backbone by outgoing bonds fr om the B units. Table

Proline is a special case, technically an imino acid. The special nature is due to the
cyclic bonding of the residue to the backbone. The rigid units in this am ino acid are
the CH n, CO, and N groups. Only transisomers are allowed for the proline amide bond.
Proline is treated in an approximate way: the C α-Cδfragment is kept rigid, the C δ-N bond
is broken, and the C α-N torsional barrier is increased. This approximation ignores the
small ﬂuctuations in the conﬁguration of the proline side-chain loop.

Appendix B: Concerted Rotation
Since the molecules under consideration can be cyclic, a Monte Carlo m ove that preserves
this constraint is required. The “concerted rotation” scheme use d for alkanes [22] can
be extended to allow rotation of the torsional angles in cyclic peptide s. This appendix
describes this extension. The reader is referred to Ref. [22] for a fuller discussion of the
original, restricted method. Themethodpresented hereallowsfor afairlygeneral molecular
geometry. In particular, the method naturally accommodates the constraint of a planar
amide bond.
To formulate the method, we consider rotating about seven torsio nal angles, which will
move the root positions of four rigid units, rotate up to three addit ional ones, and leave the
rest of the peptide ﬁxed. We deﬁne the root position of a rigid unit to be the C αposition
for a B unit, the C position for a C unit, the C position for a CH 2unit, and the S position
for the S unit in cystine. If unit 5 is a C unit, however, r5is deﬁned to be the N position
of that unit. For each unit we deﬁne θito be the angle between the incoming and outgoing
bonds. Thus, θi= 0 for a C unit, and θi≈70.5◦for all others. Figure 1 illustrates the
geometry under consideration.
The method leaves the positions riof unitsi≤0 ori≥5 ﬁxed. The torsion φ0is
changed by an amount δφ0. The values of φi,1≤i≤6, are then determined so that only
the positions riof units 1 ≤i≤4 are changed.
The method required several deﬁnitions to present the solution fo r the new torsional
angles. Vectors are deﬁned which are the diﬀerence in position betw een unitiand unit
i−1, as seen in the coordinate system of unit i:
li=r(i)
i−r(i)
i−1. (10)
The coordinate system of i is such that the incoming bond is along the ˆxdirection. Thus
li=liˆxif atomriandri−1are directly bonded and has x- and y-components otherwise.
We now deﬁne a rotation matrix that transforms from the coordina te system of unit i+1
to uniti
Ti=
cosθi sinθi 0
sinθicosφi−cosθicosφisinφi

The positions of the units in the frame of unit 1 are, thus, given by
r(1)
1=l1
r(1)
2=l1+T1l2
r(1)
3=l1+T1(l2+T2l3)
r(1)
4=l1+T1(l2+T2(l3+T3l4)). (12)
We further deﬁne the matrix that converts from the frame of ref erence of unit 1 to the
laboratory reference frame
Tlab
1= [cosψI+nn⊤(1−cosψ)+Msinψ]A, (13)
where
M=

and
n=ˆx×r
|ˆx×r|
cosψ=r·ˆx
|r|
sinψ=|r×ˆx|
|r|, (15)
whereˆxis a laboratory unit vector along the x direction, and ris the axis of the bond
coming into unit 1. The matrix Ais a rotation about ˆxand is deﬁned so that Al1= ∆r:
A=
1 0 0

where
c= (l1y∆ry+l1z∆rz)/(∆r2
y+∆r2
z)
s= (−l1z∆ry+l1y∆rz)/(∆r2
y+∆r2
z). (17)
15
Here ∆r=A[Tlab
1]−1(r1−r0) if unit 0 is a C unit; otherwise ∆ r=l1.
The method proceeds by solving for φi,2≤i≤6, analytically in terms of φ1. Then a
nonlinear equation issolved numerically todetermine which values of φ1, if any, arepossible
for the chosen value of φ0.
We will work in the coordinate system of unit 1, after it has been rota ted by the chosen
φ0. We deﬁne
t=r(1)
5−l1= [Tlab
1]−1(r5−r0)−l1. (18)
Ifθ3∝negationslash= 0 andθ5∝negationslash= 0, the square distance between unit 3 and unit 5 is known and equal to
q2
1= (l4xcosθ4−l4ysinθ4+l5x)2+(l4xsinθ4+l4ycosθ4+l5y)2. (19)
But this distance can also be written as
q2
1=|x−T2l3|2
x=T−1
1t−l2. (20)
Equating these two results, two values of φ2are possible
φI

for there to be a solution |c1| ≤1. The last three equations for c1were determined by
16
conditions similar to equating Eqs. (19) and (20). For θ3= 0,θ5∝negationslash= 0, the x-component of
r(3)

3is known to be equal to l5x+l4xcosθ4. Forθ3= 0,θ5= 0, the angle between
r3−r2andr6−r5is known to be equal to θ4.

Eq. (30) is the nonlinear equation for φ1that must be solved. The equation depends
only onφ1becauseφ2,φ3, andφ4are determined by Eqs. (21), (25), and (28) in terms of
φ1. This equation has between zero and four values for each value of φ1, however, due to
the multiple root character of Eqs. (21) and (25). Equation (30) is solved by searching the
region−π <φ<π for zero crossings. The search is in increments of ≈0.04◦. These roots
are then reﬁned by a bisection method. There is always an even numb er of roots, due to
the periodic nature of Eq. 30.
The root positions, ri, are enough to determine the position andorientation of the seven
rigid units that are modiﬁed by the concerted rotation. Rigid unit 0 is t ranslated so that its
root position is at r0. It is oriented so that its incoming bond vector is along the outgoing
bond vector of rigid unit −1. It is then rotated so that its outgoing bond vector ends at
r1. This process is repeated sequentially for rigid units 1 to 6.
Repeated application of the concerted rotation leads to a slightly imp erfect structure,
duetonumericalprecisionerrors. Inapracticalapplication, theg eometrywouldberestored
to an ideal state by application of the SHAKE [41] or Random Tweak alg orithm [42].
The transformation from φi,0≤i≤6, to the new solution which is constrained to
change only ri,1≤i≤4, actually implies a change in volume element in torsional angle
space. This change in volume element is the reason for the appearan ce of the Jacobian in
the acceptance probability. The Jacobian of the transformation f or alkanes is calculated
in Ref. [22]. It is slightly diﬀerent here since root position r5is not necessarily the head
position. The Jacobian is given by
J= 1/|detB|, (31)
where the 5 ×5 matrixBijis given by the ith component of uj×(r5−hj) fori≤3 and
by the (i−3)th component of uj×(r6−r5)/|r6−r5|fori= 4,5. Herehi=riexcept that
h5is the head position even if θ5= 0, and uiis the incoming unit bond vector for unit i.
