1 Introduction
The social mixing structure of a population or a group of interacting populations play a
crucial role in the dynamics of a disease transmission. (See [3] and re ferences therein.) In
almost all attempts to combine epidemiological data with mathematica l modeling, there
has been a recognition of the need to consider the structure of so cial interactions among
the individuals in the populations. (See [11] and references therein.) Many authors have
1
considered the multigroup models in which heterogenus subpopulatio ns may participate
to the epidemic process with diﬀerent parameters [2]. For SIS type m odels, a rather
complete analysis of existence and global stability of a nontrivial epid emic state has been
carried out by Lajmanovich and York [7]. In their work, the size of ea ch subpopulation
is assumed to be constant.
A famous example for these subpopulations is the core group, i.e. th e highly sexually
active subgroups [5]. It has become increasingly clear that the tran smission within and
among core subgroups is an important factor in the transmission of HIV/AIDS [6]. In
order toconsider thecoregroupinanSISepidemiological model, we d ivide thepopulation
into two subgroups each of them consists of susceptible and infect ive individuals. One of
these subpopulations can be viewed as the core group. In this pape r we consider another
type of core group that is post-infection core group , i.e. individuals that become part
of the core group after being infected. This hypothesis is plausible f or a contagious and
fatal disease like AIDS. From the psychological perspective, this g roup may be classiﬁed
as violent.
In this paper we examine an SIS model of disease transmission in a pop ulation of
varying size with two dissimilar groups of infective individuals. One of th ese groups
can be viewed as the post-infection core group . We also assume tha t the birth rate of
susceptibles may be more than that of infectives. This is similar to the demographic
assumption in [8]. This paper is mainly based on the discussion of the exis tence and
stability of equilibria of the proportions system. First of all, in the nex t section, we
introduce the model and some concepts of ODE’s related to the sys tem. In Section 3, we
present some basic results concerning the nonexistence of certa in types of solutions. In
Section 4, we give a complete global analysis of the proportions syst em which is reduced
to a planar system. The result is in terms of a threshold parameter w hich governs the
stability of the disease free equilibrium.

2 The Model
In order to derive our model, we divide the population into three grou ps: Susceptibles,
S, and two groups of infectives, I1andI2. We set N=S+I1+I2which is the total size
of the population and we use the following parameters which are assu med to be positive
unless otherwise speciﬁed:
b: per capita birth rate of susceptibles,
b1: per capita birth rate of infectives which is assumed to be ≤b,
d: per capita disease free death rate,
ε: excess per capita death rate of infectives,
λ1: eﬀective per capita contact rate of I1,
λ2: eﬀective per capita contact rate of I2,
γ1: per capita recovery rate of I1,
γ2: per capita recovery rate of I2.
We also assume that the susceptible individuals which have been infect ed, enter to the
groupI1andI2of proportions pandqrespectively, hence p+q= 1.
The above hypotheses leads to the following system of diﬀerential e quations in R3

where “′” denotes the derivatives with respect to t, the time,

adding the above three equations, the total population equation is
N′= (b1−d)N+b2S−ε(I1+I2)




i′
2=qs(λ1i1+λ2i2)+εi2(i1+i2)−(b1+ε+γ2)i2−b2si2. (2−3)′
In order to determine the asymptotic behaviour of the solutions of this system of
equations, we need the following concepts of ODE′srelated to our system.
Given an autonomous system of ordinary diﬀerential equations in Rn,
dx
dt=f(x), (2−5)
we will denote by x.t the value of the solution of this system at time t, that isxinitially.
ForV⊆Rn,J⊆R, we letV.J={x.t:x∈V,t∈J}. The set Vis called positively
invariant if V.R+=V. ForY⊆Rntheω-limit (resp. the α-limit) set of Yis deﬁned to
be the maximal invariant set in the closure of Y.[0,∞) (resp.Y.(−∞,0]). We say that
γ(t) is an orbit running from x0tox1if lim
t→−∞γ(t) =x0and lim
t→+∞γ(t) =x1. These two
points must be equilibria and such an orbit is called heteroclinic orbit. Wh enx1coincides
withx0, it is called a homoclinic orbit. A closed curve connecting several equilib ria whose
segments between successive equilibria are heteroclinic orbits is calle d a phase polygon.
Byasinkwemeananequilibriumatwhichalltheeigenvaluesofthelineariz edsystemhave
negative real parts. Such a point is called a source if all of these eige nvalues have positive
real parts. If some of these eigenvalues have positive real parts and the others negative
real parts, then the equilibrium is called a saddle point and it is called non degenerate if
all of these eigenvalues are nonzero.
3 Some Basic Results
We start our analysis with some basic results about the system (2 −1)′−(2−3)′. If we
set Σ =s+i1+i2, then Σ′= (1−Σ)(b1+b2s−εi1−εi2). Therefore the plane/summationtext= 1 is
invariant. We consider the feasibility region
D={(s,i1,i2) :s+i1+i2= 1,s≥0,i1≥0,i2≥0}
4
which is a triangle and on its sides we have:


s= 0 =⇒s′=b1+γ1i1+γ2i2,
i1= 0 =⇒i′
1=pλ2si2,
i2= 0 =⇒i′
2=qλ1si1.
It follows that Dis positively invariant and the disease free equilibrium (1 ,0,0) is the
only rest point on ∂D, the boundary of D. Indeed our vector ﬁeld points inward on
∂D− {(1,0,0)}. So every solution of the system (2 −1)′−(2−3)′which starts in
∂D−{(1,0,0)}, immediately gets into◦
D, the interior of D.
From now on, we examine the dynamics of this system in the feasibility r egionD. The
following theorem is a modiﬁcation of Theorem 4.1 in [1], concerning the n onexistence of
certain types of solutions.
Theorem 3.1. Letfbe a smooth vector ﬁeld in R3andγ(t) be a closed piecewise
smooth curve which is the boundary of an orientable smooth surfac eS⊂R3. Suppose
g:U→R3is deﬁned and is smooth in a neighborhood UofS. Moreover it satisﬁes
g(γ(t)).f(γ(t))≥0 and (curl g) ·n <0, where nis the unit normal to S. Thenγis not a
ﬁnite union of the orbits of the system (2-5).
In order to apply the above theorem, we deﬁne g=g1+g2+g3by
g1(i1,i2) =/bracketleftbigg
0,−f3(i1,i2)
i1i2,f2(i1,i2)

wheref1,f2andf3deduced by Σ = 1 on the right hand side of (2 −1)′,(2−2)′and
(2−3)′respectively. Now after some computations we get

Corollary 3.2. The system (2 −1)′−(2−3)′has no periodic orbits, homoclinic orbits
or phase polygons in◦
D.

Proof. WeuseTheorem3.1. for f= (f1,f2,f3). Herewehave g.f= 0and(curl g).(1,1,1)<
0 in◦
D./square
Lemma 3.3. Theω-limit set of each orbit of the system (2 −1)′−(2−3)′with initial
point inDis a rest point.
Proof. Suppose the contrary, then the ω-limit set has a regular point in◦
D. Letxbe
such a point and hbe its ﬁrst return map. For a point ynearxon the transversal, let V
be the region surrounded by the orbit γfromytoh(y) and the segment between them.
This region is known as Bendixon sack. (See Figure 3.1.)
Now by Stokes’ theorem
/integraldisplay /integraldisplay
V(curlg).(1,1,1)dσ=/integraldisplay
γg.fdt+/integraldisplay1
0g(ty+(1−t)h(y)).(y−h(y))dt.
Sinceg.f= 0 andh(x) =x, the right hand side of the above equality tends to zero when
ytends to x. But the left hand side tends to the integral over the region bound ed by the
ω-limit set. This is a contradiction since (curl g).(1,1,1)<0 in◦
D./square

Remark 3.4. When the ω-limit set lies in◦
Dthe above result is easily concluded by the
generalized Poincar´ e-Bendixon theorem [10] and Corollary 4.2. Simila rly if the α-limit
6
set of an orbit of the system (2 −1)′−(2−3)′lies in◦
D, it must be a single point.
4 The Planar System
Using the equality s+i1+i2= 1, we see that our system is essentially two dimensional.
Thus we can eliminate one of the variables, say s, to arrive at the following quadratic
planar system
/braceleftBigg
i′
1= (pλ1−b−ε−γ1)i1+pλ2i2+(i1+i2)((b2+ε−pλ1)i1−pλ2i2),(3−1)
i′
2=qλ1i1+(qλ2−b−ε−γ2)i2+(i1+i2)((b2+ε−qλ2)i2−qλ1i1).(3−2)
The dynamics of the system (2 −1)′−(2−3)′onDis equivalent to the dynamics of this
planar system in the positively invariant region
D1={(i1,i2)|i1≥0,i2≥0,i1+i2≤1}.
The matrix of the linearization of the system (3 −1),(3−2) at the origin is:
C=/bracketleftBigg
pλ1−b−ε−γ1 pλ2
qλ1 qλ2−b−ε−γ2/bracketrightBigg
,
withdet C= (b+ε+γ1)(b+ε+γ2)−pλ1(b+ε+γ2)−qλ1(b+ε+γ1). We set
R0=pλ1
b+ε+γ1+qλ2
b+ε+γ2. Hence if R0<1, thendet C > 0 andtrace C < 0 and ifR0>1
thendet C <0. Thus we have proved the following lemma.
Lemma 4.1. LetR0be the above threshold. Then the origin is a sink (resp. a saddle)
for the system (3 −1),(3−2) whenever R0<1 (resp.R0>1).
Lemma 4.2. The trace of the linearization of the system (3 −1),(3−2) at a rest point
in◦
D1is negative.
7
Proof. We compute the trace at a rest point in◦
D1.
∂i′
1
∂i1=pλ1−b−ε−γ1+(b2+ε−pλ1−pλ2)i2+2(b2+ε−pλ1)i1,
∂i′
2
∂i2=pλ2−b−ε−γ2+(b2+ε−qλ2−qλ1)i1+2(b2+ε−qλ2)i2.
Fromi′
1= 0 and i′
2= 0, we get
∂i′
1
∂i1=−pλ2i2
i1+pλ2i2
2
i1+(b2+ε−pλ1)i1=−pλ2i2
i1(1−i2)+(b2+ε−pλ1)i1,
∂i′
2
∂i2=−qλ1i1
i2+qλ1i2
1
i2+(b2+ε−qλ2)i2=−qλ1i1
i2(1−i1)+(b2+ε−qλ2)i2.
Using the equality s+i1+i2= 1, we obtain
∂i′
1
∂i1+∂i′
2
∂i2= (b2+ε−λ1)i1+(b2+ε−λ2)i2−pλ2i2s
i1−qλ1i1s
i2.
Now from (2 −1)′we have
s′=b1(i1+i2)+b2s(i1+i2)+γ1i1+γ2i2+(ε−λ1)i1s+(ε−λ2)i2s= 0.
Thus (b2+ε−λ1)i1s+(b2+ε−λ2)i2s <0 and it follows that∂i′
1
∂i1+∂i′
2
∂i2<0./square
The following two corollaries are immediate results of the above lemma.
Corollary 4.3. The system (3 −1),(3−2) has no source in◦
D1.
Corollary 4.4. Every nondegenerate rest point of the system (3 −1),(3−2) in◦
D1is
hyperbolic.
Remark 4.5. A nondegenerate rest point of the system (3 −1),(3−2) is obtained by
a transversal intersection of the two conic sections i′
1= 0 and i′
2= 0.
Proposition 4.6. There is at most one rest point in◦
D1for the system (3 −1),(3−2).
Moreover such a rest point is always hyperbolic.
8
Proof: Fromtheequilibrium conditions i′
1=i′
2= 0, weget thefollowing equation which
is homogeneous with respect to i1andi2of second order.
((pλ1−b−ε−γ1)i1+pλ2i2)((b2+ε−qλ2)i2−qλ1i1) =
(qλ1i1+(qλ2−b−ε−γ2)i2)((b2+ε−pλ1)i1−pλ2i2).
This equality can be written as
qλ1(b1+γ1)i2
1+(∗)i1i2−pλ2(b1+γ2)i2
2= 0
where (∗) is a statement in terms of the involved parameters. The set of all r oots of
this quadratic equation consists of two lines through the origin in the (i1,i2) plane. One
of these lines has negative slope and meets D1only at the origin. Thus the other line
contains all rest points ofthe system (3 −1),(3−2) inD1. Since each line contains at most
two rest points of a quadratic planar system and this line contains th e origin, it follows
that◦
D1contains at most one rest point. This rest point is obtained by a tran sversal
intersection of this line and each of the conic sections i′
1= 0 ori′
2= 0. It is easy to
see that at this rest point, these two conic sections must intersec t transversally. Now by
Remark 4.5, this rest point is nondegenerate and by Corollary 4.4, it m ust be hyperbolic.
/square
Remark 4.7. We have indeed shown that all rest points of the system (3 −1),(3−2)
which are not more than three points, are nondegenerate, excep t the origin in the case
R0= 1.
Now we are ready to prove our main result about the dynamics of the system (2 −
1)′−(2−3)′inD.
Theorem 4.8. (i) IfR0≤1, then (1 ,0,0) is a global attractor in D
(ii) IfR0>1, then there exists a unique rest point (an endemic equilibrium) in◦
Dwhich
attractsD−{(1,0,0)}.
Proof. WhenR0<1, the origin is a sink for the planar system (3 −1),(3−2). If there
exists another rest point in◦
D1for this system, it must be unique and hyperbolic. By
9
Corollary 4.3 it cannot be a source. If it is a sink, then we will have two s inks inD1.
The basins of attraction of these two points are open and by Lemma 3.3,D1is the union
of these two open subsets. This contradicts the connectedness ofD1and shows that it
cannot be a sink. Now suppose that there is a saddle point in◦
D1. By Corollary 3.2,
there is no homoclinic orbit in◦
D1. Hence the origin attracts the unstable manifold of the
saddle point. Now the region bounded by the unstable manifold conta ins some part of
the stable manifold of of the saddle point. Thus the α-limit set of this part of the stable
manifold is a rest point in D1by Remark 3.4. This is a contradiction since this rest point
can be neither the origin nor the saddle point. Therefore the origin is the only rest point
inD1for the system (3 −1),(3−2) and by Lemma 2.3, it is the ω-limit set of all points
ofD1.
The above fact is still valid for the limiting case, R0= 1. To see this, suppose that
there exists another rest point in D1, then it must be hyperbolic and belong to◦
D1. Thus
it remains in◦
D1when the involved parameters are slightly changed to get R0<1 which
contradicts the above result. This ﬁnishes the proof of (i).
Now suppose R0>1. Then the origin is a saddle point for the planar system (3 −
1),(3−2). Thus by Lemma 2.3, there must be some rest point in◦
D1. Since such a rest
point is unique and hyperbolic, it must be a sink and attract all points o fD1except the
stable manifold of the origin. We claim that the stable manifold meets D1only at the
origin. To see this notice that some part of the unstable manifold of t he origin must be
outside of D1for its right angle. Since D1is positively invariant, the stable manifold
does not intersect◦
D1. Moreover, the vector ﬁeld points inward on ∂D1−{(0,0)}. Thus
the stable manifold of the origin does not intersect ∂D1− {(0,0)}either. This shows
that the origin cannot attract any point of D1−{(0,0)}. Thus the unique sink attracts
◦
D1−{(0,0)}. Itmeansthatthereisauniquerestpointin◦
Dforthesystem(2 −1)′−(2−3)′
which attracts D−{(1,0,0)}./square
Remark 4.9. In the above argument, in order to prove the global asymptotic st ability
of the endemic equilibrium (i.e. the unique rest point in◦
D1), we showed that the stable
manifold of the origin cannot intersect◦
D1. It is a special case of the following fact. Let
Xbe a smooth vector ﬁeld on a smooth manifold MandD⊂Mis a positively invariant
10
region with a saddle point on ∂D. If the unstable manifold of this saddle point contains a
point of ( M−D)◦, then its stable manifold cannot intersect◦
D. In order to prove it, one
can follow our proof in the special case and observe that this is a dire ct consequence of
the Hartman-Grobman theorem. However, it is obvious by the Inclin ation Lemma [10].
Remark 4.10. If we consider I2as the post-infection core group, then the threshold
R0=pλ1
b+ε+γ1+qλ2
b+ε+γ2clearly shows the eﬀect of this group on the epidemics process.
Although the probability qis a small number, the fact λ2>> λ1causes the term qλ2to
be signiﬁcant.
