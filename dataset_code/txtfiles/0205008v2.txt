Extremely-low-frequency magnetic ﬁelds are known to affec t biological systems. In many cases, biological
effects display ‘windows’ in biologically effective param eters of the magnetic ﬁelds: most dramatic is the fact
that relatively intense magnetic ﬁelds sometimes do not cau se appreciable effect, while smaller ﬁelds of the
order of 10–100 µT do. Linear resonant physical processes do not explain freq uency windows in this case.
Amplitude window phenomena suggest a nonlinear physical me chanism. Such a nonlinear mechanism has
beenproposed recentlytoexplainthose ‘windows’. Itconsi ders quantum-interference effects onprotein-bound
substrate ions. Magnetic ﬁelds cause an interference of ion quantum states and change the probability of ion-
proteindissociation. Thision-interference mechanism pr edictsspeciﬁcmagnetic-ﬁeldfrequencyandamplitude
windows within which biological effects occur. It agrees wi th a lot of experiments. However, according to
the mechanism, the lifetime Γ−1of ion quantum states within a protein cavity should be of unr ealistic value,
morethan0.01sforfrequencyband10–100 Hz. Inthispaper,a biophysical mechanism hasbeenproposedthat
(i) retains the attractive features of the ion interference mechanism, i.e., predicts physical characteristics that
might be experimentally examined and (ii) uses the principl es of gyroscopic motion and removes the necessity
topostulate large lifetimes. The mechanism considers dyna mics of the density matrixof the molecular groups,

I. INTRODUCTION
Weak static and extremely-low-frequency(ELF) magnetic
ﬁelds(MFs)canaffectlivingthings: cells,tissues, physi olog-
icalsystems,andwholeorganisms[ 1,2,3]. Inmanycasesbi-
ologicaleffectsofweakMF featureresonance-likemultipe ak
behavior. Multipeak responses or magnetobiological spect ra
may appear with varying the frequency or amplitude of AC
MF [4] and the magnitude of DC MF [ 5]. Usually, the term
‘windows’isusedforthe peaksofthe spectra.
Amplitude ‘windows’, see Fig. 1, specify nonlinearity of
the transduction mechanisms involved in magnetobiologica l
effects. This is conﬁrmed more by the fact that magnetic
noisesimultaneouslysuperimposedonaregularmagneticsi g-
nalsuppressesbiologicaleffectofthat signal[ 6,7,8,9].
A nonlinear mechanism based on quantum interference
has been developed in [ 10] to explain unusual ELF MF fre-
quencyandamplitudedependenciesofmagnetobiologicalef -
fects (MBEs). The mechanism elaborates the interference of
ionsboundwithinproteins. Accordingtothismechanism,su -
perposition of the ion states forms a non-uniform pattern of
the probability density of ion. This pattern consists of a ro w
of more or less dense segments occurring due to the inter-
ference between quantum states of ions in a protein binding
cavity. In a DC MF the pattern rotateswith the cyclotronfre-
quency. Exposuretoatime-varyingMFofspeciﬁcparameters

of biochemical reactions to ultimately result in a biologic al
effect.
Biologically effective parameters of AC-DC magnetic
ﬁelds depend on the charge-to-mass ratio of the ion in ques-
tion. The closed formula is derived for ‘magnetic’ part Pof
ion-proteindissociationprobability. Predictionsbased onthis
formula reveal good agreement with experimental results in -
volving calcium, magnesium, potassium, hydrogenand other
ionsofasmoleculartargetsforMF.Thetheorydescribesmul -
tipeak frequency and amplitude spectra of MBEs involving
ionsofCa2+,Mg2+,andH+asmoleculartargetsforAC-DC
MFs[10].
Theinterferencemechanismissurprisinglyeffectiveinre t-
rospectively predicting results of existing experiments c on-
ducted under the following deﬁned MF conditions: parallel
AC-DC and pulsed MFs [ 10,11], ‘null’ and static MFs [ 13],
and various MFs with a slow rotation of a biological system
[12]. As an example, Fig. 1demonstrates the comparison of
experimentaldata, in parallel AC-DC MFs, on MBEs involv-
ing ﬁxed and rotating proteins, and calculated curve (dash
line).
The good consistencybetween theoretical calculationsand
many experiments indicates that what underlies magnetobio -
logicaleffectsis mostlikelyaninterferencephenomenon.
According to the interference mechanism, the relation
should be valid Γ−1Ωc/greaterorsimilar1, whereΓ−1is the lifetime of
ion quantum states within a bound cavity and Ωcis a cy-
clotron frequency of an ion in the geomagnetic ﬁeld, usually
10–100Hz. The postulate therefore has to be made that ion
quantum states, more exactly their angular modes, live more
than 0.01 s within the cavity. However it is in contradic-
tion with our common knowledge that such states might live

only10−12–10−10sbecauseofthethermalizinginteractionof
ion with cavity walls. On the other hand, the weak AC MF,
/planckover2pi1Ωc≪kBT,iscommonlybelievedtobeunabletocontribute
into thermally driven (bio)chemical reactions (so-called kT-
problem).
To overcome the problem, we note that there is a speciﬁc
mechanism that provides relatively large lifetime of the an -
gular modes. Consider a dipole molecular group that are at-
tached within the cavity to its walls in two points, i.e. by tw o
covalent bonds, thus forming a group that may rotate inside
the cavity without contact with walls. Such a construction i s
referred to as gyroscope. In the case, it is a molecular gy-
roscope. Of importance is the fact that thermal oscillation s
of that covalent bonds, or gyroscope’s supports, make only
zero torque about the axis of rotation. This leads to rela-
tivelyslow thermalizationofa gyroscopicdegreeoffreedo m.
Relaxation is mainly due to van der Waals interaction with
thermalizing walls. As far as the interaction potential, th e
Lennard–Jones potential, decreases as r−6and walls’ inner
surface grows as r2, the overall van der Waals contribution
varies approximately as r−4. That is, relaxation quickly di-
minishes with the cavity size to grow. Computations showalmostfreerotations(thermalizationtime0.01s)ofamole cu-
largyrowithinthecavityof28angstr¨ omssize. Thisisenou gh

II. MOLECULARGYROSCOPE
A long lifetime of angular modes is the sole serious ideal-
ization underlying the mechanism of ion interference. This
idealization would be hard to substantiate with the ion-in-
protein-capsule model. One would have to assume that the
ionformsboundstatesofthepolarontypewithcapsulewalls .
In turn, justiﬁcation of a large lifetime of polaron angular
modes would require new idealizations. A ‘vicious circle’
occurs which one could not leave without having to substan-
tially change the model itself. Thus, despite the obvious ad -
vantages of the ion-in-capsule model, namely, simplicity a nd
a high forecasting skill, we have to recognize its limitatio ns
andseek forothersolutions.

One of them hinges on the use of conservation laws in the
dynamics of rotating solids. Rotation of a solid is describe d

acting on the solid. Considerfor simplicity a symmetricgyr o
rotating around one of its main axes of inertia with a force F

of this force about the shown axis is obviously zero. From

Let the gyro be a model of a rigid molecule free to move

Since△ϕ∼π, then△L∼/planckover2pi1/2π; thus the angular momen-

however, even for small molecules, the estimate of deviatio n

We now estimate values of Sandρ. The following notation

Sinceηis a constant, the frequency spectrum is deﬁned
mainlybytheequation ξ= 0,i.e.,
ωmm′−ωg(m−m′)−nΩ = 0.
For arbitrary small m,m′frequencies ωmm′fall into the mi-

As is seen, the magnitude of the magnetic effect depends on
the ratio of the density matrix elements at the initial momen t

It is instructive to note that the molecule need not have
a dipole moment/summationtext
iqirifor the magnetic effect to appear.
Rather, it is important that the ‘charge moment of inertia’ Q(10)beotherthanzero. Thiscanbethecaseintheabsenceof

The main properties of the gyro interference are identical
with those of the ion interference, namely, (i) multiple pea ks
intheamplitudeandfrequencyspectra,(ii)dependenceoft he
positionsoffrequencypeaksontheDCMFintensity,and(iii )
independenceofthepositionsofamplitudemaximaontheAC
MF frequency.
We notethat theinterferenceofa moleculargyrohassome
features that differ it from the ion interference. Firstly, the
peak frequencies are deﬁned with respect to the gyral fre-
quencyωg— a rotation equivalent of cyclotron frequency.
Peakfrequenciesdependonthedistributionofelectriccha rges
over the molecule and may deviate from harmonics and sub-
harmonics of the cyclotron frequency. Secondly, the gyro
rotation axis is ﬁxed with respect to the shell, which intro-
duces, in the general case, one more averaging parameter in
themodel. However,thesefeaturesarenotofprincipalsign if-

be calculated for any conﬁguration of magnetic and electric
ﬁelds, for rotation of biological systems and macromolecul es
involved,etc.

As is seen from ( 16) the absolute magnitude of the mag-

that, for relaxation times of order 0.01s, the size of cavity
shouldbebelow30 ˚A.

on the gyro axis, as shown in Fig. 5. We assume that these

Wewillassumethatthemolecularsubsystemiscompletely

determine the gyro thermalization time t1as a solution of
the equation T1(t) = 0.99T, and the time of heavy parti-
cle system thermalization t2, as a solution of the equation
T2(t) = 0.99T. The gyro is thermalized by interacting with
thesystemofheavyparticles,thereforeitsthermalizatio ntime

will always exceed the heavy particle system thermalizatio n

We analyzed the behavior of the system for R0= 1˚A,∞
andM=m,100m. The dependence of gyro thermalization
timet1on cavity diameter bis shown in Fig. 7. It is evident
that, whatever the values of R0andM, the thermalization
timeincreasesexponentiallywith b. Ifweextrapolatethisde-
pendenceto therangeoflarge b, we see that,at b= 28–32˚A,
the thermalization time, and hence the gyro relaxation time
Γ−1, will be of the orderof seconds. With this size of cavity,
themoleculargyrowill revolvealmost freely.
V. CONCLUSION
The molecular interfering gyroscope is a challenger for
solvingthekT-problemasaprobablemechanismofmagneto-
biologicaleffects. Indeed,the wallsofa proteincavitydo not
interfere with the gyro degree of freedom directly via short -
range chemical bonds. For cavities larger than 30 ˚A in size,
thecontributiontotherelaxationfromthevanderWaalsele c-
tromagneticforces,inducedbywalloscillations,issmall . Ra-
diation damping is negligibly small. Finally, the oscillat ions

The role of molecular gyros could probably be played by
short sections of polypeptides and nucleic acids built insi de
globular proteins or in cavities between associated globul es.
