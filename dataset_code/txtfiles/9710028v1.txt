By exact computer enumeration and combinatorial methods, w e have calculated the des-
ignability of proteins in a simple lattice H-Pmodel for the protein folding problem. We
show that if the strength of the non-additive part of the inte raction potential becomes larger
than a critical value, the degree of designability of struct ures will depend on the parameters
of potential. We also show that the existence of a unique grou nd state is highly sensitive to
mutation in certain sites.

I. Introduction
Biologically active proteins fold into a native compact structure desp ite the huge number of possible
conﬁgurations [1]. Though the mechanism of protein folding is not fully understood, it has been known
since the re-folding experiments of Anﬁnsen [2] that globular prote ins fold in the absence of any catalytic
biomolecules. From this fact, it has been established that for prote ins,the three dimensional folded structure
is the minimum free energy structure, and, the information coded in the amino-acid sequence is suﬃcient
to determine the native structure [3]. The compactness of this uniq ue native state is largely due to the
existence of an optimal amount of hydrophobic amino-acid residues [4], since these biological objects are
usually designed to work in water [5]. The relation between the primary one dimensional sequence and the
ﬁnal compact three dimensional structure is the task of the prot ein folding problem.
In addition to the paradoxicalproblem ofkineticsand time scalesoft he foldingprocess[6], there is another
mystery. If proteins are made randomly by amino acids, the number of all possible such proteins with typical
length of 100, is far larger than the number of proteins which actua lly occur in nature. One hypothesis is
that the naturally selected sequences are special because they a re coded for structures that have unique and
stable native states, allowing for easy folding. Thus a central ques tion of protein evolution is how mutational
change in the amino acid sequence leads to changes in the structure and stability.
Some eﬀorts have been made in order to study the stability of prote ins against mutation by searching the
two dimensional conﬁguration space [7,8]. One simple model used in the se studies is the H-Pmodel [9]. In
this model there are only two types of chain monomers, hydrophob ic (H) and polar ( P). Every H-Hcontact
between topological neighbours is assigned a negative contact ene rgy, and other contact interactions are set
to zero.
Recently Li et al.[10], have looked at this problem in three dimensions. Calculating the en ergy of all
possible 27-mers in all compact three dimensional conﬁguration, th ey have found that, there are a few
structures, into which a high number of sequences uniquely fold. Th is structures were named ”highly
designable” and the number of sequences which fold into each state was named its ”designability”. In their
H-Pmodel, they choosethe contact energybetween HandPmonomersby somephysical arguments[10,11].
Other signiﬁcant points of their work are: a) Only a few percent of s equences have unique ground state; b)
There is a jump in energy gap for these highly designable structures . Thus the highly designable structures
are more stable against mutation and thermal ﬂuctuation.
Dill and Chan [12] have argued that many of the phenomena observe d in proteins can be adequately
understood in terms of the H-P model, but according to the work of Pandeet al.[13] the designability of a
conformation does depend on the nature of interactions between monomers. May be any interaction leads
to some highly designable structures, but diﬀerent interactions yie ld diﬀerent patterns.
In our work we study this problem for an additive potential. We will sho w that there are some highly
designablestructuresforthispotential,butthelowdesignablestr uctureswilldisappearbecauseofdegeneracy
of ground state. We will show that there is a ladder structure for e nergy levels for this form of potential. We
then add a non-additive part to the energy, then the ground stat e degeneracy of low designable structures
will be removed. We show there is a critical value for non-additive par t of potential, where below this critical
value the patterns of highly designable structures are ﬁxed, but a bove this critical value the designability of
structures is sensitive to the value of non-additive part of the pot ential. We show that the sequences which
fold to highly designable structure are sensitive to mutation of some sites.
An additive potential has the following advantages:
a) It allows us to prepare a very fast algorithm which is then possible t o run on a PC.
b) It enables us to solve and study some parts of the problem by com binatorial methods.
c) It gives a clear picture for designability.
d) A ladder spectrum for the energy levels results, thus it arms us t o study the problem for non-additive
potentials.

II. The Model
We consider an H-Plattice model [9]. In this model only non-sequential nearest neighbo urs interact.
Because the native structures of proteins are compact with the Htype monomers sitting in the core, the
eﬀective potentials which are usually used, all of the forces are att ractive (negative values for potential) and
the strength of the force between H-Hmonomers is greater than others. We can write the general form o f
the potential in an arbitrary energy scale as:
EPP= 0, E HP=−1, E HH=−2−γ. (1)
The most usual choice of H-Pmodel potential corresponds to the limit γ≫1 [7–9,12], however physical
arguments are consistent with a smaller value for γ, for instance γ= 0.3 was used by Li et al.[10]. They
have calculated the energy of all of 227sequences in 103 ,346 compact conﬁguration for a 27-sites cube, by
a huge enumeration.
In the case γ= 0, we have an additive potential. If we let H=−1, andP= 0, we can rewrite the
potential in the form,
Eσiσj=σi+σj. (2)
Following Li et al.[10], we consider only compact structures of sequences with length 27, occupying all
sites of a 3 ×3×3 cube [14]. There are 103 ,346 compact conﬁgurations which are not related to each other
by rotation and reﬂection symmetries. Let us call the set of all com pact structures, the structure space.
A protein of length Nmay be shown by an N-component vector
|σ/an}bracketri}ht=|σi1,σi2,...,σ iN/an}bracketri}ht, (3)
wherein= 1,2 refers to PandHresidues. Thus the number of such N-component vectors for proteins with
length 27 is 227. Let us call the set of |σ/an}bracketri}ht, the sequence space.
Because of the additive form of the potential, we can write the ener gy of a given |σ/an}bracketri}htin any spatial
conﬁguration as,
E=27/summationdisplay
i=1piσi, (4)
wherepi’s are the number of non-sequential neighbours of the ith monomer, or by introducing the neigh-
bourhood vector |P/an}bracketri}ht,
E=/an}bracketle{tσ|P/an}bracketri}ht. (5)
Thevector |P/an}bracketri}hthas27componentsandat ithcomponent hasthe numberofneighboursofthe ith monomer.
Duetotheshapeof |P/an}bracketri}htthetypeofneighboursisnotrelevantandallwehavetodoiscountt henon-sequential
neighbours. This gives us an additional symmetry for the energy th at is diﬀerent from spatial symmetries.
For example any of the sites in a two dimensional 5 ×5 square for two spatial conﬁgurations which are shown
in ﬁgs. 1a and 1b, have equal neighbours, but the labels of their neig hbours are not the same. Visualisation
of the same eﬀect in 3 dimensions is a bit harder, but it dose exist.
The space of all 3 dimensional structures has 103 ,347 members for all compact full ﬁlled structures in a
3×3×3 cube. Due to this additional symmetry this space is divided into 6291 subspaces, where all members
of each subspace have the same |P/an}bracketri}ht. Let the number of members of a subspace be, Nd. The range of Ndis
from 1 to 96. Fig. 2, shows that the frequency of large values of Nd, is low. Interestingly there are a lot of
|P/an}bracketri}ht’s which only point to one structure.

FIG. 2. Histogram of Ndfor members of structure space. It is interesting that there are some Psets with Nd= 1.
We have calculated the energy of all 227|σ/an}bracketri}hton all|P/an}bracketri}ht. We ﬁnd the degeneracy of ground state in structure
space. One can see the distribution of number of ground state deg eneracies g, for all of 227sequences in ﬁg.
3. There are only a few sequences which have non-degenerate gro und state, this corresponds to the 8 .47%
of sequences at g= 1. If energy of one sequence is minimised in a |P/an}bracketri}htwithNdgreater than one it has
degenerate ground state. According to deﬁnition of designability, such sequences should not be considered.
The distribution of Nsis presented for γ= 0 in ﬁg. 4. Comparing this ﬁgure with ﬁg. 2 of Li et al.[10],
we observe that there is no similarity. This suggests that designabilit y (Ns), is sensitive to the value of γ,
which is γ= 0 in our work, whereas Li et al.choseγ= 0.3. However as we shall see later, the fact that at
γ= 0, we have an additive potential plays an important role. In fact a s mall value of γradically change the
picture.

FIG. 4. Histogram of Nsfor additive potential.
If we consider all of sequences which have non-degenerate groun d state in structure space, we get a new
picture for designability. This means that we calculate the designabilit y of all|P/an}bracketri}ht’s, and not only those with
Nd= 1. This is contrast to Nswhich had only Nd= 1.
To recognise this diﬀerence, we show designability of structures, b yN′

the nature of the energy gap in the case γ/ne}ationslash= 0 in section V.

In our enumeration we have calculated the energy of any sequence in all 6291 |P/an}bracketri}ht’s, but in ﬁg. 5 , we
show the results for 3153 |P/an}bracketri}ht’s which are not related to each other by reverse labelling. We can not reduce
the structure space according to this symmetry before enumera tion. Reverse labelling for a nonsymmetric
sequence gives two diﬀerent conﬁgurations which may have diﬀeren t energies.
III. Energy levels
The number of non-sequential neighbours is related to type of site . A 3×3×3 cube has 8 corner sites
(C), 12 link sites ( L), 6 face sites ( F), and one centre site ( O) (ﬁg. 6). Csites have three neighbours, where
two of them are connected by sequential links and there is only one n on-sequential neighbour. Similarly L,
FandOsites have 2, 3 and 4 non-sequential neighbours respectively. We m ust add 1 to these numbers for
two ends of chain.

This sites are divided in two classes, {C,F}and{L,O}. In a self avoiding walk in this cube, we must
jump in any step from one set to other. The ﬁrst set has 14 member s and the second has 13. Thus a walk
passes through CandFsites in odd steps, and through LandOsites in even steps. In other words, the
odd components of |P/an}bracketri}htare 1 or 3, and even components are 2 or 4, (except the 1st and 27 th components
which are like even components). Thus,
|P/an}bracketri}ht=|p1,...,p 27/an}bracketri}ht, (6)
where,
pi=/braceleftbigg
1,3 odd i′s;
2,4 even i′s.(7)

i∈evenσαi, (9)
where,

0pi= 1 or 2;
1pi= 3 or 4.(10)
Two last terms in eq. (9) are independent of |X/an}bracketri}htor|P/an}bracketri}ht, thus they result in a constant, which can be ignored
when comparing energies of a sequence in diﬀerent conﬁgurations. The ﬁrst term in eq. (9) is an integer
times two, thus it results in a ladder energy spectrum with gaps of 2. Therefore the energy gap for all of
structures is the same, and there is no diﬀerence between low desig nable and high designable structures.
IV. Combinatorial Approach
Our aim is to ﬁnd the N′
sfor any spatial conﬁguration, determined by a vector |P/an}bracketri}ht. Because |X/an}bracketri}hthas a
simpler structure, than |P/an}bracketri}ht, we shall use |X/an}bracketri}htinstead of |P/an}bracketri}ht. Any vector |X/an}bracketri}ht, has seven 1’s and twenty 0’s.
One of the 1’s is in the even sites, and the others are in odd sites. Ene rgy could be calculated by performing
a “logical and” of two binary numbers ( |σ/an}bracketri}htand|X/an}bracketri}ht). For example, a typical |P/an}bracketri}htis,
P.4 1 3 3 1 1 1 1 3 1 3 1 3 2
2 2 4 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
To recognise odd and even components of the vectors, we show th em in the above form, writing the even
sites below. The vector |X/an}bracketri}htcorresponding to the above |P/an}bracketri}htis,
X.1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
On the other hand |σ/an}bracketri}ht’s have a similar form:
7
σ.H0H H H 0 0 H0H H 0H H
0H0H0 0 H H H 0 0 0 H
Where we show Pmonomers by numerical equivalence of them. Recall that numeric eq uivalence for H
monomers is −1. Energy of any sequence in any spatial conﬁguration is calculated by inner product of its
|σ/an}bracketri}htto corresponding |X/an}bracketri}ht. For the above |σ/an}bracketri}htand|X/an}bracketri}htthe energy is 5 H. This value is related to exact value
of energy according to eq.(9) by a factor of two and two sequence dependent additional terms, since we
are interested in the ground state and the energy gap of a sequen ce, the sequence dependent term may be
ignored, as structure determines these quantities alone.
By construction any |X/an}bracketri}hthas six 1’s in odd sites, and one 1 in even sites. If we don’t consider any other
constraint for |X/an}bracketri}ht, we obtain an upper limit for number of |X/an}bracketri}ht’s.
n=/parenleftbigg14
6/parenrightbigg
×/parenleftbigg13
1/parenrightbigg
= 39039. (11)
This is far larger than the number of possible |X/an}bracketri}ht’s which we have obtained by enumeration, that is 6291.
The fact that all 39039 possible conﬁguration don’t exist points to e xtra constraints which are yet to be
discussed. If all 39039 of |X/an}bracketri}ht’s were to exist each of them would have to be unique ground state of only one
sequence, thus removing all interest! To see this, it is enough to ins ert anHinto|X/an}bracketri}htwhere ever one ﬁnds
a 1, and Pfor zeros. Indeed absence of some of these vectors in real world makes some of the other more
preferable in nature.
The connectivity of a self avoiding walk, further constraints the |X/an}bracketri}ht. For example to pass through centre
site, the walk has to pass through two face sites. This means that t he only 1 (corresponding to centre site) in
even sites must be sandwiched between two 1’s in odd sites (face site s). This constraint reduces the number
of possible |X/an}bracketri}ht’s. Two 1’s in odd sites are ﬁxed by even 1, and only 12 sites remain for f our other 1’s. Then
there are,
n=/parenleftbigg12
4/parenrightbigg
×/parenleftbigg13
1/parenrightbigg
= 6435, (12)
vectors. This number is still larger than exact number of |X/an}bracketri}hts by 144. Although due to our enumeration
we know these 144 vectors, we can not ﬁnd the complex constraint s which prune them out, and we shall
continue our calculation as though these 144 vectors were correc t. Of course the values are diﬀerent from
exact enumeration, however it can be seen that this diﬀerence is no t too large, and it may be considered as
an approximation to the exact solution. Also we aid a computer enume ration including the extra 144 vectors
and have compared the results with the combinatorial calculation. T his has served as a check on our code.
We now proceed to calculate N′
sfor the following example:
X0,1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
First let us introduce some new parameters and notations. We will sh ow the energy of a |σ/an}bracketri}htin an|X/an}bracketri}htas:
E=E(a,b,c) = (a+b+c)H, (13)
wherea,bandcare related to energy parts which come from centre (1 in lower row) , faces which are
connected to centre, and energy of other parts, respectively. For example energy of following |σ/an}bracketri}ht:
σ,H0H H 0H0 0 H H 0 0 H H
0H0 0 H H H 0H0 0 H0
in|X0/an}bracketri}ht, isE(0,2,3) = 5H.
8
Besides, we name the number of pairs of 1’s in the upper row of |X/an}bracketri}htaszand the number of 1’s in two
ends of vectors as y. For|X0/an}bracketri}ht,z= 2, and y= 1.
Now we try to count the number of all polymers which have their ener gy minimised in |X0/an}bracketri}htand, there is
no other |X/an}bracketri}htwith energy equal to ground state for them. To do this we discuss a ll possible cases.
i:E(1,2,4)
Such polymers have at least seven Hsites corresponding to 1’s of X0. These polymers have minimum
possible energy, thus X0is a minimum energy conﬁguration for them. But it must be checked wh ether it is
a unique ground state or not. First consider polymers which in additio n to these seven H’s have another H
monomer in their upper row sites,
σ1.H0H H H 0 0 0 H0H0H0
0 0 H0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
The energy of this sequence in following |X/an}bracketri}htis 7Htoo.
X1.1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Then the ground state of polymers which have additional Hmonomers in corresponding to upper row 0’s of
X0, is degenerate, and they don’t count in N′
sofX0. The above discussion is independent of value of aand
binE(a,b,4), and degrees of freedom to choose sites for Hmonomers is limited to lower row sites.
For the|X/an}bracketri}htwithz/ne}ationslash= 1 (like X0) polymers can not have Hmonomers in the lower sites between two upper
row 1’s. For example, the following sequence,
σ2,H0H H H 0 0 0 H0 0 0 H0
0 0 H H 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
has energy 7 Hin following |X/an}bracketri}httoo.
X2.1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Then the contribution of polymers with E(1,2,4) inN′
sis:
N′
s(i) = 212−(z−1)= 213−z(14)
ii:E(0,2,4)
In this case if z >1 (such as X0) the ground state is degenerate. It can be seen that any sequen ce with
energyE= (0,2,4) inX0state has the same energy in X2state. In the case z= 1, only the sites in lower
row by condition that they are not a neighbour of corresponding up per 1’s of X, have freedom to be an H
orPmonomer. There are 2 ×6−z−ysites which don’t have this freedom in lower row. Then,
N′
s(ii) =/braceleftbigg
22−yz= 1
0 z >1(15)
9
iii:E(1,0,4)
In this case there is only one sequence with nondegenerate ground state. For our example, X0, this
sequence is,
σ3.H0 0 0 H0 0 0 H0 0 0 H0
0 0 H0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
In the above sequence changing any Pmonomer to Htype, will cause the ground state to becomes
degenerate. Then,
N′
s(iii) = 1 (16)
iv:E(1,1,4)
For this case bis 1, and if this 1 comes from right or left neighbour of lower 1, it has diﬀ erent solutions.
Then we introduce new parameters ( zR,yR) and (zL,yL), which are similar to old zandy, when right or
left neighbour 1 of lower 1 will be omitted. For X0we have zR= 0,zL= 1 and yR=yL=y= 1. By
introducing this new parameters this case is very similar to case ii, and the diﬀerence comes from number
of corresponding 1’s in upper row (ﬁve instead six), and no restrict ion in value of z. Then,
N′
s(iv) = 23+zR+yR+23+zL+yL. (17)
v:Other cases
All of the other cases for ground state energy are degenerate, and need not be considered.
With this analysis it is possible to ﬁnd N′
sfor any|X/an}bracketri}ht. For our X0example it is,
N′
s(i) = 211
N′
s(ii) = 0
N′
s(iii) = 1
N′
s(iv) = 24+25,
that gives,
N′
s(X0) = 2097
Inthiswayallofthe valuesof N′
s’scanbecalculated. Hadthe144additionalstructuresbeentaken out, the
calculation of N′
sfor the problem would correspond to enumeration exactly. Howeve r taking these structures
out is too complex and would have to be done case by case. Besides of the value of N′
s, this calculation
shows that the sequences whit non-degenerate ground state ha ve between 4 to 6 Htype monomers in face
sites and no one in corner sites. Indeed in our model the stability of p olymers is very sensitive to mutation
in corner sites.
V. Nonadditive potentials
In the case γ/ne}ationslash= 0 the potential is non-additive. In this case we can write the energ y ofαth sequence in
µth spatial conﬁguration as:
Eαµ=/an}bracketle{tσα|Pµ/an}bracketri}ht−1
2γ/an}bracketle{tσα|Mµ|σα/an}bracketri}ht. (18)

Any|P/an}bracketri}hthasNddiﬀerent M-matrices. The ﬁrst term in eq. (18) was calculated in the case γ= 0, and
we need calculate only the last part. The aim of our calculation is to ﬁnd the ground state. In any compact
conﬁguration in a 3 ×3×3 cube, there are 28 non-sequential neighbour pairs. Thus the co ntribution of the
last term in energy is less than 28 γ. We have shown that energy spectrum for the previous case has a ladder
structure with energy gap equal to 2. In this case these split to so me sublevels (ﬁg. 7). Then if we choose
γ <2
28the levels are separate. Of course this is a lower estimation for γ. In the next section we will obtain
a better estimate for lower and upper limits of the critical value of γ.

FIG. 7. Energy levels of additive potential split to subleve ls for non-additive potential.
From the result of the additive potential we have a subset Pin the space of all spatial conﬁgurations
which gives the minimum energy to folding. This Psubset has Ndmembers which all of them have the same
|P/an}bracketri}ht. For small γ’s the ground state and the ﬁrst excited state are between these Ndstructures, and it is not
necessary to calculate the energy for all of 103 ,346 spatial structures for any sequence,except for sequences
which their ground state is in structures with Nd= 1. For The Nd= 1 structures the value of Nsdoes not
change, and it is not necessary to run the program. The ﬁrst excit ed state of these sequences are in an other
Psubset. Thus to ﬁnd the energy gap for them the program must be run over all of the 103 ,346 structures.
We have calculated this energy spectrum, and have found the new Nsfor all 103 ,346 structures. We show
the results for 51 ,704 conﬁguration which are unrelated by reverse labelling symmetry in ﬁg. 8. We have
found the energy gap for ﬁrst excited state for all sequences. Y ou can see the diagram of mean of energy
gapvs.Nsin ﬁg. 9. This ﬁgure shows that highly designable structures which ar e related to Psubsets with
one member.

FIG. 9. The mean of energy gap vs.Ns. There is a jump in energy gap for highly designable structur es. All of
these highly designable structures have Nd= 1.
In this enumeration we have calculated the energy spectrum for all of the sequences which have nondegen-
erate ground state for the additive potential. We had removed som e of the sequences because of degeneracy
of ground state in additive potential case. It is possible that this de generacy will be removed by the non-
additive part of the potential, and some of the sequences haveuniq ue ground state for non-additive potential.

But the energy gap for these sequences is of order of γ, and if we consider them it causes a shift in horizontal
axes to bigger Nsand bring down the points nearer to γvalue in vertical direction in ﬁg. 9. These make
this ﬁgure more similar to results of Li et al.[10]. In their work the energy gap for low designable structures
are of order of γ( they choose γ= 0.3) also.
VI. Estimation of γc
The energy levels for the additive potential have a ladder structur e, as it had been proven in previous
sections. The energy gaps between the levels is 2 in our arbitrary en ergy unit.
In the case of γ/ne}ationslash= 0 the energy has two parts (eq. 18). The ﬁrst part comes from a dditive part of potential
and does not change. Second part comes from non-additive part o f potential, and is equal to number of H-H
non-sequential neighbours in spatial conﬁguration. Because this non-additive part, the energy spectrum is
changed, and any level is splited to some sublevels (ﬁg. 7).
If contribution of the second part to energy is less than 2, for all s tructures, the ground state and excited
state of any polymer is between |P/an}bracketri}htpartners of its ground state for additive potential , except for |P/an}bracketri}htwith
Nd= 1, where there is only ground state.
Letδe0be the diﬀerence of ground state energies of additive and non-add itive potentials, and δe1be
diﬀerence energy of ﬁrst excited state in the case of γ= 0 with minimum of new energies for the sequence
in the structures corresponding to these excited states (there is no uniqueness constraint for excited states).
Ifδe0−δe1<2 the ground state doesn’t change and the values of Nsfor structures that we presented in
past section don’t change. By increasing γ, the absolute values of δe0andδe1increase.
To ﬁnd the diﬀerence between δe0andδe1one have to calculate the diﬀerence in H-Hcontacts in ground
state structure and maximum of H-Hcontacts in excited level structures.
This diﬀerence has two sources. Because the energy levels in the ca seγ= 0 are separated by 2, then
diﬀerence of them comes from replacing a Hmonomer from Osite to an Lsite, or from an Fsite to aCsite.
Both of them cause increasing in energy by 2. But it is possible that th ese replacing decrease the energy by
2γ. For example consider one Fsite with no Hneighbour will go to one Csite with two non-sequential H
neighbours (this monomer must be an end residue). then this gives a n upper limit for γc, that is 1.
The other source for increasing the H-Hcontacts, comes from replacing Hmonomers in LandFsites by
the same type sites. These changes only are relevant in the case γ/ne}ationslash= 0. The maximum of increasing in H-H
contacts because these replacing are 6 γ, related to the sequences which have 4 Hmonomers in the Fsites
and 5 to 7 in Lsites in their ground state structures. Thus the lower limit for γcis2
2+6= 0.25. Therefore,
0.25< γc<1. (20)
This shows that there is a non zero value for γc, which for γless than it, the ground state structure of
sequences doesn’t change. Indeed γcdistinguishes two phases. If γ < γ c, the degree of designability of
structures is independent of γ, and the change in value of γonly changes the energy gaps. On the other
hand for γ > γ c, the designability of structures becomes sensitive to the value of γ, and the patterns of
highly designable structures will be changed if the potential change s.
If the designability is the answer of “why has the nature selected a s mall fraction of possible conﬁgurations
for folded states?”, the above discussion shows that this selectio n is potential independent if γ < γ c, and
sensitive to inter monomers interactions if γ > γc.
