Abstract
Nearly a quarter of genomic sequences and almost half of all r eceptors that
are likely to be targets for drug design1are integral membrane proteins. Un-
derstanding the detailed mechanisms of the folding of membr ane proteins is a
largely unsolved, key problem in structural biology. Here, we introduce a gen-
eral model and use computer simulations to study the equilib rium properties
and the folding kinetics of a Cα-based two helix bundle fragment (comprised
of 66 amino-acids) of Bacteriorhodopsin. Various intermed iates are identiﬁed
and their free energy are calculated toghether with the free energy barrier
between them. In 40% of folding trajectories, the folding ra te is considerably
increased by the presence of non-obligatory intermediates acting as traps. In
all cases, a substantial portion of the helices is rapidly fo rmed. This initial
stage is followed by a long period of consolidation of the hel ices accompa-
nied by their correct packing within the membrane. Our resul ts provide the
1
framework for understanding the variety of folding pathway s of helical trans-
membrane proteins.

Considerable eﬀort has been expended to understand the dynamic s of the folding and
biological functionality of proteins. Whereas the behavior of small w ater soluble globular
proteins is reasonably well understood both experimentally and the oretically2,3, much less
is known about membrane proteins (MP)4–7that cross biological membranes. Transmem-
brane proteins (TMP) are the most important and best studied clas s of MP4,5,8. They are
characterized by the presence in their primary structure of long s egments (20 −30) of amino
acids with a high degree of hydrophobicity. In the native structure , these correspond to the
transmembrane segments which are inserted in the lipidic interior of t he membrane9. These
segments are predominantly made up of α-helices and β-sheets. The stability of α-helices
andβ-sheets inside the membrane follow from the formation of hydrogen bonds between the
backbone atoms – other possibilities are excluded within the apolar en viroment4,10.
Phenomenological models have proved to be powerful for interpre ting experimental data.
The most common of these is the Two-Stage model based on experimental evidence that
the folding of TMP occurs in two stages. In the ﬁrst stage, α-helices and β-sheets are
formed with the full native state structure being formed in a distinc t second stage10. A
more reﬁned model4takes into account four main steps: partitioning, folding, insertion and
association. Recently, Pappu et al.11have used a potential smoothing algorithm to predict
transmembrane helix packing in good accord with experimental data .
Milik and Skolnick12,13have carried out careful Monte Carlo studies of the insertion
of peptide chains into lipid membranes and have proposed a new hydro pathy scale based
on experimental data obtained by studying the interactions of trip eptides with phospho-
lipid membranes14and the self-solvation eﬀect in protein systems15. Recently Wimley and
White16havedesignedtransmembranepeptidesthatspontaneouslyinser tacrossbilayersbut
yet have measurable monomeric water stability, opening the way for the determination of
the thermodynamic cost of partitioning hydrogen bonded peptide b onds into the membrane
hydrocarbon core.
The Monte-Carlo results ofMilikandSkolnick12,13areingoodaccordwithEngelmanand
Steitz’shelicalhairpinhypothesis17furtherextendedbyJacobsandWhite18,19. Theunfolded
3
chain is ﬁrst adsorbed onto the membrane interface, driven mostly by the hydrophobic
eﬀect and electrostatic lipid-protein interactions20–22. A polypeptide chain has a greater
possibility, while anchored to the interface, of saturating its intern al hydrogen bonds and
forming helices. Such helical fragments have a greater propensity to subsequently diﬀuse
into the lipid phase.
AdetailedstudyofTMPhasnotyetbeenpossiblebecauselittleisknow nabouttheinter-
actions between amino acids inside the membrane or between them an d the lipid molecules.
Here, we adopt a simple, yet powerful, strategy for attacking the folding properties of TMP
that circumvents this shortcoming. Our novel approach is based o n extensive studies of
the folding of globular proteins which have underscored the importa nt role played by the
topology of the native state in controlling both the functionality and the main features of
the folding process. Nature uses a rich repertory of twenty kinds of amino acids with some-
times major and at other times subtle diﬀerences in their interaction s with the solvent and
with each other in order to design sequences that ﬁt the putative n ative state with minimal
frustration32. Thus a fruitful and general strategy for the study of protein f olding would be
to extract information on the folding process directly from the top ology of the native state.
Our study here focuses on the folding process by using a tractable approach (described
in the Methods Section) that by-passes the details of the complex in teractions of the protein
in the lipid enviroment by introducing eﬀective potentials, induced by t he presence of the
membrane and the associated interface region, that stabilize the n ative state structure. The
validity of the approach based on the native state topology, in the c ase of globular pro-
teins, has been conﬁrmed a posteriori from the agreement betwe en theory and experimental
ﬁndings2,23–31. The approach proposed here is similar in spirit and ought to be a tool and a
guide for the diﬃcult experimental situation of TMP16. Our model allows a complete char-
acterization of the thermodynamics and the dynamics of the full fo lding process. Due to the
small number of degrees of freedom involved, the dynamics of the s ystem can be simulated
for the full folding process. Moreover, the free energies of the m ost relevant intermediate
states and free energy proﬁles along the reaction paths connect ing them can be explicitly
4
calculated by thermodynamic integration (see Methods). Thus the model is able to quanti-
tatively discriminate between the possible reaction paths envisaged for the insertion process
of TMP across the membrane4, a feature that is not an obvious consequence of the structure
of the model. Where there is overlap, our model captures the qualit ative features of the
earlier simulations of Milik and Skolnick12,13.
The TMP we considered is made up of the ﬁrst 66 amino acids of bacter iorhodopsin
consisting of two α-helices (Fig. 1 a). It has been shown that the ﬁrst two helices of bacteri-
orhodopsin can be considered as independent folding domains33. Furthermore, the side-by-
side interactions between transmembrane helices play a key role in th e stabilization of the
protein structure34.
OurstudieswerecarriedoutusingaMonteCarloalgorithmthathasb eenproventobeex-
tremely eﬃcient for interacting hetero-polymers (Methods). The behaviour of the structural
similarity between the system equilibrated at temperature T(measured in dimensionless
units) and the native state is shown in Figure 1 bin terms of the average fraction of native
state contacts as a function of Tand partitioned depending on their positions with respect
to the membrane. The three curves correspond respectively to t he average fraction of native
contacts inside ( qm) , outside ( qb) and across ( qs) the membrane (see Methods). All these
curves, well separated at high T, collapse for Tbelow the transition temperature TC∼0.6,
indicating a cooperative eﬀect in the folding. On monitoring the free e nergy as a function
of the energy around TC, one observes additional local minima (besides those correspondin g
to the unfolded and folded states) suggesting the presence of an intermediate.
The intermediate is characterized by having the two helices almost co mpletely formed
but not yet correctly inserted across the membrane. A metastab le state in which the protein
exists at the membrane interface ought to be expected on genera l grounds. Indeed a generic
heteropolymer withhydrophobic andhydrophilic aminoacids, ofwhich aTMPisaparticular
case, has a favorable conformation which is localized near surfaces between two selective
media (the outside and the inside part of the membrane in the presen t case)35,36. At not too
high temperatures, the gain in energy to place hydrophobic/hydro philic protein segments in
5
their preferred enviroment compensates the entropy loss for be ing localized at the interface
with respect to remain in the bulk phase. Thus, even though our mod el does not explicitly
contain information on the character of the amino acids, it is able to p redict this feature.
The presence of these extra minima suggests that non-constitut ive membrane proteins
wouldfoldwithmulti-statekineticscorrespondingtoon-pathwayint ermediates. Toestablish
their nature of and their inﬂuence on the dominant folding pathways , we have performed
a detailed analysis of the folding kinetics. Each independent kinetic fo lding simulation was
started with the equilibrated denaturated state at T∗= 2.5 . The protein is placed initially
outside the membrane in the interface region4, at a distance comparable to the average
size of the denatured protein and then suddenly quenched to a tem perature ( T= 0.4) well
belowthetransitiontemperature. Thiscasesimulatesthefoldingkin eticsofnon-constitutive
membrane proteins, i.e. proteins that do not need a translocon pro viding a ’tunnel’ through
which the protein is injected into the lipid bilayer. Folding to the native s tate occurs mainly
through the states depicted in Figure 2 awith the dominant pathways shown in Figure 2 b.
In all the pathways, thesystem goes fromtheunfolded state, Uto stateHIin which 80%
of the secondary structure is formed (see qin Figure 3 c) and disposed horizontally along the
interface. The free energy of this state (measured with respect to the free energy of the fully
folded state) is ∼2.4 TC. This state corresponds to the formation of around 70 % of the
membrane contacts. The average time τHIto reach state HIis of the order of 500 Monte
Carlo steps (see Figures 3 and 4; each Monte-Carlo step correspo nds to 50000 attempted
local deformations.). State HI turns out to be an obligatory on-pa thway intermediate of the
folding kinetics for non-constitutive MP in agreement with the gener al argument mentioned
above. Once the protein reaches state HI, it undergoes a relatively slow process of self-
arrangement in order to insert and assemble the secondary struc tures across the membrane.
Thisprocessistherate-limitingstepofthefoldingprocess, sinceitin volvesthetranslocation,
throughthelipidiclayer, ofasubstantialnumberofhydrophilicresid ues. Amongthepossible
pathways, starting from HI, the most frequent (60% of the cases) and the fastest turn out
to beU→HI→HV→N. A quantitative characterization of this dominant pathway
6
is presented in Figures 3 (for a single folding process) and 4 (as an av erage over 40 folding
processes). The intermediate HVis characterized by having one αhelix inserted across the
membrane and is reached in an average period corresponding to a sig niﬁcant fraction of the
total folding time (see Figure 3). The free energy in this state is ∼0.98TC.The free energy
barrier between HIandHVis at∼4.31TC(hence, the rate constant of the transition
HI→HVis proportional to kHI→HV= exp(−(4.31−2.4)TC/T)). The full free energy
proﬁle versus a reaction coordinate is shown in Fig. 5. The last part o f the folding process
corresponds to the insertion of the second helix and the assembly o f the two secondary
structures into the native state structure. This process lasts a pproximately one third of the
folding time along the pathway U→HI→HV→N. The quasistatic free energy barrier
betweenHVand the folded state is ∼1.66TC. The rate costant of the transition HV→N
is, therefore, proportional to exp( −(1.66−0.98)TC/T). These results are consistent with
the time scales observed in the unconstrained folding dynamics. At t he end, the protein
is completely packed, ( qmsaturates to 1 (Figures 3 aand 4a)) and the helices are correctly
positioned across the membrane (note the second jump in the zcoordinate of the center of
mass in Figures 3 band 4b).
Much slower dynamics can occur when non-obligatory intermediates are visited by the
system. These long lived states ( {I}in Figure 2 a) involve a distribution of misfolded regions
that trap the system and are characterized by having most of the inter-helical contacts
formed (assembly of the secondary structures) but with the two α-helices still incorrectly
positioned. Note, for example, that in states {I}, only transmembrane contacts and some
contacts outside the membrane are misplaced and they account fo r only a small fraction
of the native state energy. For this reason, in the states {I}, the free energy is ∼1.44
TC, only slightly higher than the free energy of HV. The folding can proceed from {I}
either by disentangling the two helices and passing through the obliga tory intermediate
HV, or by the simultaneous translocation through the membrane of th e two helices. These
processes, however, entail the crossing of a big free energy bar rier (∼5.18TCfor the ﬁrst
process and 6 .1 for the second) and happen with low probability. Indeed, at suﬃcie ntly
7
low temperatures, the loss in energy of the interhelical contacts is not compensated by the
gain in the conﬁgurational entropy due to the uncoupling of the α−helices. Thus below the
folding temperature, I-states act as trapping regions for the sy stem and when trapped, the
protein spends most of the time during folding in this state.
In summary, we have presented detailed calculations of helical tran smembrane proteins
leading to a vivid picture of the folding process. Our strategy relies o n the dominant role
played by the topology of the native state structure and by the eﬀ ective geometry imposed
by the membrane and provides a picture which would be expected to b e quite accurate for
well-designed sequences that are a good ﬁt to the target native st ate conformation. It is
interesting to note that , with our choice of the parameters, the p athway in which the helices
assemble outside the membrane and are inserted later is unlikely to oc cur.
Models based on the topology of the native state structure have b een remarkably
successful25–28in correctly describing the main features of the folding process det ermined
in experiments2,23,24,29–31for various globular proteins. A similar approach has been gen-
eralized here to the almost virgin ﬁeld of transmembrane proteins wh ere experiments are
rather diﬃcult16,4,7. Our ﬁndings do not depend on the precise values of the ǫparameters
introduced in the model underscoring the robustness of the resu lts. Our approach predicts a
folding process involving multiple pathways with a dominant folding chan nel. The simpliciy
of our model allows for a quantitative description of all the pathway s since we can monitor
the correct/uncorrect formation of native contacts andcompu te free energy proﬁles. Further
details not captured by the present approach arising from amino-a cid speciﬁc interactions
among themselves, with the solvent and in particular with the interior of the membrane
may of course change the quantitative nature of the results. How ever, our model, which
captures the bare essentials of a membrane protein, ought to pro vide a zeroth order picture
of the folding process. Also, as experimental data becomes availab le, the results could be
benchmarked with models of this type to glean the other factors th at matter.

I. METHODS
We represent the residues of the membrane protein as single beads centered in their
Cαpositions. Adjacent beads are tethered together into a polymer c hain by a harmonic
potential with the average Cα−Cαdistance along the chain equal to 3 .8˚A. The membrane
is described simply by a slab of width w=zmax−zmin= 26˚A. Two non-bonded residues
(i,j) form a contact if their distance is less then 6 .5˚A. In the study of globular proteins,
the topology of the native state is encoded in the contact map giving the pairs ( i,j) of
non-bonded residues that are in contact. Here, in addition, the loc ations of such pairs
with respect to the membrane becomes crucial. The contacts are d ivided into three classes:
membrane contacts where both iandjresidues are inside the membrane, interface contacts
withiandjin the interface region4outside the membrane and surface contacts with one
residue inside the membrane and the other outside. Thus a given pro tein conformation can
have anative contact but improperlyplaced withrespect tothemem brane (misplaced native
contact). The crucial interaction potential between non-bonded residue s (i,j) is taken to be
a modiﬁed Lennard-Jones 12-10 potential:
Γ(i,j)
5/parenleftBiggdij
rij/parenrightBigg12
−6/parenleftBiggdij
rij/parenrightBigg10
+5 Γ1(i,j)/parenleftBiggdij
rij/parenrightBigg12
. (1)
The matrices Γ( i,j) and Γ 1(i,j) encode the topology of the TMP in the following way: if
(i,j) is not a contact in the native state Γ( i,j) = 0,Γ1(i,j) = 1; if ( i,j) is a contact in the
nativestatebutnotattheproperlocation(i.e. amisplacedcontact )Γ(i,j) =ǫ1,Γ1(i,j) = 0;
if (i,j) is a native state contact in the proper region Γ( i,j) =ǫ,Γ1(i,j) = 0. This model
is intended to describe the folding process in the interface and in the membrane region.
Our interaction potential (similar in spirit to a well known model37for globular proteins
(see also other approaches that model helix formation38,39)) assigns two values to the energy
associated with the formation of a native contact, ǫandǫ1.
The model captures the tendency to form native contacts. In ad dition, in order to
account for the eﬀective interactions between the membrane and the protein, the model
9
assigns a lower energy, −ǫ, to the contact which occurs in the same region as in the native
state structure compared to −ǫ1when the contact is formed but in the wrong region of
space. This feature proves to be crucial in determining the mechan ism of insertion of the
protein across the membrane in order to place all native contacts in the same regions as in
the native state. Even though the interaction potential is simple an d intuitively appealing,
it is not possible to simply guess (without detailed calculations) the fold ing mechanism and
quantitatively determine the probability of occurrence of the vario us folding pathways4.
Whenǫ=ǫ1, the protein does not recognize the presence of the interface-m embrane
region and the full rotational symmetry is restored (the system b ehaves like a globular
protein). The diﬀerence in the parameters ( ǫ−ǫ1) controls the amount of tertiary structure
formationoutside the membrane. When the diﬀerence is small, the pr otein assembles almost
completely outside the membrane and the insertion process would be diﬀusion limited. Our
results are independent of the precise values of the energy param etersǫandǫ1(ǫ > ǫ1) as
long as they are not too close to each other.
We report here the results of simulations with ǫ1= 0.1 andǫ= 1.rijanddijare
the distance between the two residues ( i,j) and their distance in the native conﬁguration,
respectively. In order to account for the chirality of the TMP, a po tential for the pseudodi-
hedral angle αibetween the Cαatoms in a helix corresponding to four successive locations
is added which biases the helices to be in their native state structure .
The thermodynamics and the kinetics of the model were studied by a Monte Carlo
method for polymer chains allowing for local deformations. The eﬃcie ncy of the program
(usually low for continuum calculations) has been increased by full us e of the link cell
technique40and by the multiple Markov chain method, a new sampling scheme, which has
been proven to be particulary eﬃcient in exploring the low temperatu re phase diagram for
polymers41. In our simulation 20 diﬀerent temperatures ranging from T= 2 toT= 0.17
have been studied. The free energy is calculated by reweighting the diﬀerent temperatures
with the Ferrenberg-Swendsen42algorithm.
The free energy diﬀerence FB−FAbetween two states A and B has been estimated as
10
the reversible work that has to be done in order to go from A to B. He nce, denoting by

whereas the free energy barriers are accurate within ∼0.5TC. This error takes into account
possible hysteresis eﬀects due to the ﬁnite simulation time.

enter into the membrane separately. HVdenotes an obligatory intermediate and Ndepicts
the native state. The state {I}represents an ensemble of long lived conformations in which
helices are formed inside the membrane with several inter-helical co ntacts, but with the two
α-helices still incorrectly positioned. This conformations diﬀer in term of packing eﬃciency
of the helices. The state {I}is not obligatory for the folding kinetics. In b)the schematic
pathways to the native state are shown. In the most directed pat h, the entropy decreases
on going from UtoN. FromHItoHVthe entropy loss of one helix is not compensated by
a corresponding energy gain until both helices become vertical. This is the principal origin
15
of the high free energy barrier between the state HIand the native state.
Figure 3: Typical time dependence of diﬀerent parameters as a function of t he Monte-
Carlo steps for the pathway U→HI→HV→N. Fraction of native contacts inside the
membrane ( a), normalized z-coordinate of the center of mass of the protein (w ith respect to
that of the native state conformation) ( b) and overall fraction of native helical contacts ( c).
Each Monte-Carlo step corresponds to 50000 attempted local de formations. The transition
from state HIto state HVis signalled by a sharp jump of the position of the center of
mass. Note that there is no perceptible sign of this transition in term s of newly formed
native contacts. Most of the helical contacts are formed in the ea rly stages of the folding.
This fraction does not signiﬁcantly increase until helices correctly a ssemble and the inter-
helical contacts are formed. The HV→Ntransition is reached by a progressive zippering
of the horizontal and vertical helices. This zippering is usually very q uick (few MC steps)
and is only slightly slowed down (see the plateau corresponding to qm∼0.9 ina) when the
trajectory passes through somewhat deformed conformations . (d) Protein conformations at
diﬀerent timesduring thefolding. Thecolours red, greenandblueha ve thesame signiﬁcance
as in Figure 1a with the grey bonds being ones crossing the membrane .
Figure 4: Distribution of the fraction of native contacts inside the membrane
(a) and of the normalized z-coordinate of the center of mass ( Rz=zcm

obtained using 40 independent kinetic simulations with pathway U→HI→HV→N.
The grey scale distribution indicates the probabilities at given times: d arker points denote
higher probability.
Figure 5: Free energy proﬁles along three reaction coordinates at T=0.85T C. The
continuous lines are spline ﬁts to the free energy data (crosses) . To obtain free energy
diﬀerences between two states we estimate the reversible work th at has be done to go from
one state to the other. For this purpose, we ﬁx the z coordinate o f a speciﬁc residue in order
to compute the canonical average of the force and then apply eq. (2) (See Methods). The
free energy of the native state is deﬁned to be equal to 0. ( a) Free energy as a function of
thez-coordinate of the 58-th residue ( z= 0 corresponds to the middle of the membrane)
16
starting from HV; this forces the second helix to cross the membra ne as the protein goes
from HV to N; the local minimum at z ≃20 corresponds to a state topologically equivalent
to HV, with the helix containing the 58-th residue fully formed on the m embrane interface
but without any contact with the ﬁrst helix (in HV some of the inter-h elices contacts are
already formed); ( b) the 5-th residue is translocated across the membrane with the pr otein
starting from state HI and proceeding to HV; ( c) the same as in ( b), but the initial state is
