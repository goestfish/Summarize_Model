The so called long range correlation properties of DNA seque nces are studied using the variance
analyses of the density distribution of a single or a group of nucleotides in a model independent way.
This new method which was suggested earlier has been applied to extract slope parameters that
characterize the correlation properties for several intro n containing and intron less DNA sequences.

any two complimentary distributions (like GAis complimentary to TCorGis complimentary to
ATC) have identical ﬂuctuations at all scales although their di stribution functions need not be
identical. Due to this complimentarity, the famous DNA walk representation whose statistical
interpretation is still unresolved is shown to be a special c ase of the present formalism with a
density distribution corresponding to a purine or a pyrimid ine group. Another interesting aspect
of most of the DNA sequences is that the factorial moments as a function of length exceed unity
around a region where the variance versus length in a log-log plot shows a bending. This is a
pure phenomenological observation which is found for sever al DNA sequences with a few exception.
Therefore, this length scale has been used as an approximate measure to exclude the bending regions
from the slope analyses. The asymmetries in the nucleotide c ontents or the patchy structure as a
possible origin of the long range correlations has also been investigated.

I. INTRODUCTION
Recently, therehasbeen considerableinterestin the ﬁndingoflong rangecorrelationsin genomicDNA sequences[1].
ADNAsequenceisachainofsites, eachoccupiedbyeitherapurine(A denineandGuanine)orapyrimidine(Cytocyine
and Thymine) group. For mathematical modeling, the DNA sequence might be considered as a string of symbols
(G, A, T and C) whose correlation structure can be characterized completely by all possible base-base correlation
functions or their corresponding power spectra. Diﬀerent techn iques including mutual information functions and
power spectra analyses [1–9], auto correlation [10–12], DNA walk rep resentation [13–20], wavelet analysis [21,22]
and Zipf analysis [23] were used for statistical analyses of DNA sequ ences. But despite the eﬀort spent, it is still
an open question whether the long range correlation properties ar e diﬀerent for protein coding (exonic) and non
coding (intronic, intergenemic) sequences [24]. One more fundamen tal ground, there is still continuing debate as to
whether the reported long range correlations really mean a lack of in dependence at long distances or simply reﬂect
the patchiness (bias in nucleotide composition) of DNA sequences. T here have been attempts to eliminate local
patchiness using methods such as min-max [13], detrended ﬂuctuat ion analysis (DFA) [24,25] and wavelet analysis
[21]. In spite of its success in modeling the long range correlations obs erved in DNA sequences, as indicated by the
power law increase in the variance and the inverse power law spectru m [5,9], the problem of the correct statistical
interpretation of DNA walk is still unresolved and is attracting the at tention of an increasing number of investigators.
Since approaches based on diﬀerent models predict diﬀerent corre lation structure, there is no unique measure of the
degree of correlation in DNA sequences. Therefore, it is very impor tant to investigate the correlations and extract
the power law exponent αrather in a model independent way so that the interpretation of th e data including the
theoretical analysis becomes more meaningful. There is another co nfusion related to this study is the absence of a
clear deﬁnition of the term ”long range”. Clearly, what is considered to be long is relative to what is considered
to be short. To over come some of these problems, recently we hav e suggested a new method [26] to measure the
degree of correlations using the variance analysis of the density dis tribution of a single or a group of nucleotides. We
have also suggested a way to ﬁnd out an approximate length scale ab ove which all DNA sequences show strong long
range correlations irrespective of their intron contents while below this, the correlation is relatively weak. Further,
the density distribution which is nearly Gaussian at short distances s hows signiﬁcant deviations from the Gaussian
statistics at large distances. In this paper, we present the details of the analyses and also extract the correlation
parameter αfor several intron containing and intronless sequences.

II. DENSITY DISTRIBUTION AND FACTORIAL MOMENTS:
In the present method, we build the frequency spectrum of a single or a group of nucleotides by dividing the DNA
sequence into many equal intervals of length l. For example, to build a purine spectrum, we compute
n=l0+l/summationdisplay
i=l0ui (1)
whereui=1 if the site is occupied by a G or A and ui=0 otherwise. Ideally, one can divide the entire DNA sequence of
lengthLintomequal intervals of size l(l=L/m). The purine or GA spectrum can be built by computing nfrom all
the intervals. Alternatively, ncan be computed in any segment between l0andl0+land the spectrum ( ndistribution
orPn) is built by varying the starting position l0from 1, 2, 3 etc upto L−lso as to cover the whole sequence1. We
adopt this second procedure for better statistics. Finally, the st andard deviation (SD) of this Pndistribution can be
obtained from σ2=< n2−n02>which in general will depend on the interval or the window size l.
In addition to the standard deviation σ2, we also compute the factorial moments Fq’s ofPn. The normalized
factorial moments of order q are written as
Fq=fq
fq
1(2)
where
fq=∞/summationdisplay
n=qPnn(n−1).....(n−q+1) =∞/summationdisplay
n=qn!
(n−q)!Pn (3)
As will be shown later, the factorial moment has the distinct advant age over the normal moments in identifying the
genomic sequence from the random one. It may be mentioned here t hat for random Poisson distribution, the factorial
moments for all q’s become unity i.e. for
Pn=ane−a
n!(4)
the above factor for fqbecomes
fq=∞/summationdisplay
n=qn!
(n−q)!ane−a
n!=∞/summationdisplay
n=qane−a
(n−q)!=∞/summationdisplay
m=0am+qe−a
m!=aq∞/summationdisplay
m=0ame−a
m!=aq(5)
which gives Fq=1.
In this work, we have applied the above factorial moment analysis (g enerally used to study the ﬂuctuations during
a phase transition [27]) to study the dynamical ﬂuctuations presen t in the DNA sequences.
III. PRINCIPLE OF COMPLIMENTARITY
A general property noticed for all the genomic sequences (of sta tistically signiﬁcant length) with a few exceptions
is that the distributions of any single or group of nucleotides which ha s a probability of occurrence phas the same
variance σas that of its complimentary group that has the probability of occur rence (1 −p), although both have
diﬀerent distribution functions. This would imply that even a single nuc leotide distribution say Gdistribution will
have same variance as that of ATCdistribution or a GAdistribution will have identical variance as that of TC
distribution. Figure 1 shows σversuslplots for GandGAdistributions (solid curves) for two typical sequences of
DROMHC (Drosphilia Melanogaster, MHC, 22663 bps, 20 .5%G, 30.3%A, 25.4%T, 23.8%C) andSCMIT(yeast
1At short distances, ncan be zero due to the non occurence of a given nucleotide. In s uch cases, the density spectrum can be
built either including or excluding zerothchannel. In this analysis, we include zerothchannel also so that the complementarity
is satisﬁed which is unlike the case when the zerothchannel is excluded. See appendix B for details

mitochondrial DNA, 9 .1%G, 42.2%A, 40.7%T, 8.0%C). As can be seen from the ﬁgure, the GandGAdistributions
have same σat all scale as that of ATCandTCdistributions (ﬁlled circles) although the distribution functions of
the two complimentary groups need not be identical. The above agre ement is exact for most of the DNA sequences
(with a few exceptions) as well as for the random sequences. For e xample, the σforGandATCdistributions of
SCMITandE.Coli:TN10 (E.Coliwith aTN10 mobile transposion (9147 bps) at location 22000 bps) show 2% to
3% deviations at all scale depending on the total length of the seque nces where as for other DNA as well as random
sequences, this agreement is exact. (This diﬀerence is not visible fr om ﬁgure 1 in case of SCMITas the deviation
is insigniﬁcant over a large distance).
FIG. 1. The variance σversuslforGandGAdistributions (solid curves). Top panel is for DROMHC (Drosophilia
Melanogaster, MHC) while the bottom panel for SCMIT(yeast mitocondrial DNA). The ﬁlled circles are for the comp limen-
taryATCandTCdistributions. The curve RW(dotted curve) corresponds to the slope in case of random wal k (see text for
details). The curves are scaled up appropriately for better clarity.
Within the present formalism, we can also reproduce the result of ra ndom walk ( RW) model (See appendix for
more detail) by assigning ui= 1 for purine group ( GandA) andui=−1 for pyrimidine group ( TandC). However,
unlike the random walk model of interpreting +1 and −1 as the probability of step up and step down, Pncan be
considered as the frequency distribution of nwhich gives the excess or deﬁcit of purines over pyrimidines. The σ
versuslas obtained from this assignment has also been shown in ﬁgure 1 (see the dotted curves labeled RW) for
comparison. It is interesting to note that the RWcurves shows a parallel shift with respect to the GAorTCcurves
indicating that GAorTCdistributions and RWmodel have similar ﬂuctuations at all scale. This is an interesting
observations, as we can now use GAorTCdistributions as alternatives to the DNA walk representation to stu dy the
correlation. The advantage is, since nrepresents a sum, unlike the DNA walk model, the entire spectrum lies to the
positive side of the coordinates which is essential to compute variou s higher moments like Fqof the distributions.
It is also important to note that although the complimentary distribu tions have same σat all scale, the distribution
functions need not be exactly identical. Figure 2 shows a typical nor malized density distribution functions Pnof
two complimentary distributions GandATCfor the above two sequences ( SCMITandDROMHC ) as a function
ofn−n0(wheren0is the average count ) at a typical length scale of l= 150 (ﬁgures in left). The ﬁgures to the
right shows Pndistributions ( x-axis is shifted by 100 for clarity) corresponding to the two purely r andom sequences
having same length and nucleotide contents as that of DROMHC andSCMITsequences. It is interesting to note
that although σversuslplots are (nearly) identical i.e., both distributions have same ﬂuctuations at all scales, the
distribution functions are not identical. This is an important charact eristic of a DNA sequence which is not found in
case of a random one.

appropriate G,A,TandCcontents.
IV. EXTRACTION OF SLOPE PARAMETER
The long range correlations are generally studied from the relation σ∼lαwhere the parameter αis extracted from
theσversuslplot in the log-log scale. For the case of a completely random sequenc e,α∼0.5. The deviation of
αfrom 0.5 indicates presence of long range correlations. We have estimated σofG,A,T,CandGAdistributions
for several DNA sequences and found that σversuslplot in the log-log scale is not linear over the entire length2.
Figure 3 shows σversuslplot (bottom panel) for a typical E.Colisequence of length L= 1.2 Mbps (solid curves)
andL= 30 Kbps (dotted curves) respectively. The top panel shows the factorial distributions of q=2, 3, 4 and 6 for
a typical Adistributions, although similar plots can be obtained for other nucleo tide distributions as well. A general
feature of the factorial moments of the DNA sequence with a few e xception is that at short distances, Fq<1.0 for all
q′sand exceeds unity at some point say at lq. This behavior is not found in case of a purely random sequence wher e
Fqis always ≤1.0. Further, all q’s do not cross unity exactly at the same point, lqbeing more for higher qvalues.
However, this variation is insigniﬁcant over a very large scale if we res trict to some of the lower moments say up to
q= 6.
From these plots and also from the several other studies, we make following few observations; (i) The σversusl
plot is not linear through out, rather starts bending around some r egion (say lc, which could be diﬀerent for diﬀerent
distributions) indicating a change of slope from α1toα2, (ii) For most of the cases, while α1shows weak deviation
from 0.5,α2deviates signiﬁcantly from 0 .5 and also depends on the sequence length L, (iii) The individual nucleotide
distributions may have stronger correlations than any sum like GAandTCdistributions or any other combinations.
2We consider only the G,A,TandCdistributions to extract the correlation parameters for th e individual nucelotides and
GAdistributions to simulate the results of random walk model

FIG. 3. (a) The factorial moments Fqversuslfor a typical Adistributions of E.Colisequence of length 1.2 Mbps. (b) The
corresponding slope parameter σversuslforE.Coliof length 1.2 Mbps (solid curves) and of length 30 Kbps (dashe d curves).
The curves are scaled up appropriately for clarity.
Sinceσversuslin the log-log plot starts bending around lc, we can extract the slope by dividing the entire length
into two segments; one for l < lcand the other one for l > lc. This can be done by examining each case individually.
However, we have noticed an approximate correlationbetween this bending region in σversuslplot and the cross over
pointslqof the corresponding factorial moments i.e. the slope changes aro und the same region where the factorial
moments become unity. This is a pure phenomenological observation which is found for several DNA sequences as
listed in tables with a few exceptions which we will discuss below. It may b e mentioned here that although, the
two complimentary distributions have same ﬂuctuations, both need not have identical factorial moments. Figure 4
shows the plots of FqversuslforAandGTCdistribution for a LAMCG sequence. Since both are complimentary,
they have identical ﬂuctuations at all scales (hence same bending r egion), but the cross over regions in Fqplots are
diﬀerent, being higher for ATCdistributions (due to large average values n0at all scales). While the lqvalue of the A
distribution shows an approximate correlation with the bending regio n ofσversuslplot where a possible slope change
occurs, the lqvalues of GTCdistribution has no such correlations. This is true for any complemen tary distributions
ofG,A,TandCexcept for GAandTCdistributions since both have nearly same overlapping cross over re gions.
5
FIG. 4. The factorial moments FqversuslforGandATCdistributions of LAMCG sequence
Therefore, only the lqvalues of the G,A,T,CandGAdistributions are used as an approximate length scales
(lc). The entire length of the sequence is divided into two parts one for 0< l < l c1and other for lc2< l < L max
wherelc1andlc2are the minimum and maximum of all the lccorresponding to G,A,T,CandGAdistributions.
TheLmax=L/30, i.e. we have at least 30 independent data sets so that the statis tical analysis becomes meaningful.
Therefore, excluding the region lc1< l < l c2, we have extracted α1andα2since the linearity in these two segments
are found to be extremely good for most of the cases. The results are summarized in three tables which covers both
intronless and intron containing sequences. The table shows the len gth of the sequence Lused in the analyses, the
cross over values lq( same as lc), the slope parameters α1andα2and also the corresponding percentage of the
nucleotide contents P. A general observation is that the sequence is weakly correlated a t short distance with α1
which is quite close to 0 .5 where as for l > lc, the correlation is relatively stronger with a larger value of α2. Now we
discuss a few exceptions like in the case of SCMITandPODOT 7 (T7 bacteriophage, 39936 bps). Figure 5 shows
the factorial moments of a typical Gdistributions. In both the cases, the factorial moments do not ha ve any cross
over point. In case of SCMIT, the factorial moments are much higher than unity even at small dis tance and starts
decreasing afterwards. The similar behavior is found for Cdistribution also. However, the A,TandGAdistributions
do have lcpoints. Therefore, using lc1as∼36 andlc2∼184, we estimated α1andα2forG,A,T,CandGA
distributions which are listed in table III. The symbol′∗′indicates absence of any critical value. It is interesting to
note that α1is quite large and in some cases α1> α2. On the other hand , the factorial moments of the sequence like
PODOT 7 do not reach unity at any scale. The absence of such type of scale has been indicated by the symbol′−′
in table III. This type of sequences behave like a pure random one ha vingαvalues quite close to 0 .5. We have listed
a few such sequences with exceptions in table III.

FIG. 5. The factorial moments FqversuslforGdistributions of SCMIT(scaled up) and PODOT7 (T7 bacteriophage)
sequences.
Further, we would like to mention here that we have noticed that the factorial moments for many sequences starts
decreasing at large distances. Also for a few cases, the factorial moments start decreasing even at a very short
distances. Consequently, the slope also changes accordingly. How ever, we would not like to assign any reasons due to
lack of enough statistics.
The slope with α= 0.5 corresponds to the case of a normal diﬀusion process of a rando m Brownian trajectory. The
basic idea of a Brownian motion is that of a random walk having a Gaussia n distribution probability for the position
of the random walker after a time twith the variance ( σ2) proportional to t(σ∼tαwhereα= 0.5). This corresponds
to the case of normal diﬀusion. However, nature shows enough ex amples of anomalous diﬀusion characterized by a
variance which does not follow a linear growth in time [28]. In such cases either the diﬀusion is accelerated if α >0.5
or the growth is dispersive if α <0.5. As found in the analyses (see tables I and II), α2>0.5 at large distances for
most of the sequences irrespective of their intron contents. How ever, a few sequences as shown in table III, not only
peculiar, may also have αwhich decreases at large distances. In such cases, α <0.5 which may indicate the inﬂuence
of dispersive dynamics. This aspect needs further investigations. Finally, we would like to add here that α1is close to
0.5 for most of the sequences at short distance (see tables I and II ). Although, α= 0.5 would imply about a random
behavior, it can not be told conclusively from the present analyses u nless the short distance eﬀects are taken into
consideration [29].
V. PATCHY SEQUENCES
In the following, we investigate whether the mosaic character of DN A consisting of patches of diﬀerent composition
can account for apparent long range correlations in DNA sequence s [18]. The Chargaﬀ’s second parity rule states
that in a single strand G≈CandT≈A. However, asymmetries in base composition have been observed in m any
sequences. A quantitative estimate of the GCandATskews can be obtained from the relation ( G−C)/(G+C)
(Excess of Gnucleotides over Cnucleotides) and ( A−T)/(A+T) (Excess of Anucleotides over Tnucleotides). This
is, operationally equivalent to estimating nas deﬁned in Eq.(1) except nnow represents the count ( G−C)/(G+C)
forGCskew and ( A−T)/(A+T)forATskew in a ﬁxed window size of ( L/20). We consider LAMCG as an example
and plot n(deﬁned appropriately) versus l0where the starting position of the sliding window l0varies from 1, 2, 3 etc
7
uptoL−l. Figure 6 shows the plots of GCandATskews as a function of the length for a typical LAMCG sequence.
The plots show a change in the direction of the slope with a change in sig n of the skew. The quantity and quality of
the skew can be assessed from the Vor from the inverted- Vshape of the curves.
FIG. 6. The GCandATskews as a function of l0forLAMCG sequence.
From the above plots, we can identify three well known compositiona l domains of LAMCG of size 22000 bps ( GA
contents 0.54), 17000 bps ( GAcontents 0.47) and 9000 bps ( GAcontents 0.54). We also consider an artiﬁcially
generated sequence by joining three random patches of size 2200 0 bps, 17000 bps and 9000 bps respectively with
appropriate G,A,TandCcontents. We also consider another heterogeneous sequence ge nerated from E.ColiDNA
by a mobile insertion of TN10 at location 22000 bps. The correspondin g random patches are of size 22000 bps, 9147
bps and 22000 bps respectively3
3Please note the distinction between the random sequence whi ch is generated by joining three random patches of total leng th
Land a pure random one of length L. Although, both the sequence has same percentage of nucleot ide contents in the length
L, the former is random only patch wise.

FIG. 7. The FqversuslofCdistribution of for LAMCG and an artiﬁcially sequence generated by joining three rand omly
generated patches of size 22000 bps, 17000 bps and 9000 bps wi th the same G,A,TandCcontents as that of LAMCG .
Figure 7 showsthe Fqversuslplot of a typical Cdistribution for LAMCG and for an artiﬁciallygenerated sequence
(random only patch wise). Interestingly, the factorial moments f or both the cases behave similarly. Figure 8 shows a
similarσ(l) versuslplot both for real and artiﬁcially generated (from random patches ) sequences. Although, in some
cases both agree, in general they are not identical at the individua l nucleotide levels particularly at large distances
(Note that the scale is highly compressed). This deviation would mean that at large distances, the density distribution
functions will have signiﬁcant discrepancy due to diﬀerent widths. S o at a ﬁrst look from the σversuslplot, we can
say that the actual DNA sequences and the RANDOM patches need not have identical slopes α(hence the width
σ) at large distances for all the nucelotides although they agree in so me cases. Even at short distances, although
the DNA and the RANDOM sequences have nearly identical width σ, the full shape of the distributions need not be
identical. To demonstrate this, we invoke the principle of complimenta ry which was mentioned before.

Figure 9(a) shows a GandATCdistribution (left most) for a LAMCG sequence at l= 300. Notice that although
σversuslplots are identical, i.e. both distributions have same ﬂuctuations at a ll scales, the distribution functions
are not same. Such diﬀerences are not found for a real random se quence (right most). The middle ﬁgure corresponds
to the case of artiﬁcially generated random sequence. Although, t he artiﬁcially generated sequence mimics the real
sequence to some extent, it is not fully capable of reproducing the c haracteristic of a real sequence. Figure 9(b) shows
another comparison for a E.Coli::TN10 sequence for AandGTCdistributions. This discrepancy will be more
prominent at higher lvalues which the artiﬁcially generated sequence can not reproduce .

VI. DENSITY DISTRIBUTIONS
In [26], we had demonstrated that the density distribution Pnis Gaussian at short distances and starts deviating
from it as the distance increases. Figure 10 shows another example wherePnhas been plotted for two complimentary
distributions at l= 25, 100 and 200 respectively. The complimentary distributions are nearly identical at short
distance and coincide with the random distributions where as Pndistributions for G,ATCand pure random one are
all diﬀerent at larger distances.
FIG. 10. The density distribution Pnversusn−n0(wheren0is average density) for LAMCG sequence at l= 25, 100 and
200 respectively. The solid and the dashed curves are for GandATCdistributions respectively where as the dotted curve is
for a purely random sequence.
Thus, irrespective of intron contents, most of the sequences fo llow Gaussian statistics at short distances. However,
at large distances, the statistics deviates signiﬁcantly from the Ga ussian nature.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, we have extended our previous work to extract the slope parameter αfor several intron containing
and intron less DNA sequences. The advantage of the present met hod is that the variance analysis can be applied
to any individual or group of nucleotides. We believe that the individua l nucleotides provide a more fundamental
measure of the correlation than any combination or group (like the D NA walk representation) where the eﬀects may
get reduced or washed out. Another interesting aspect is the (low er) factorial moments of most of the DNA sequences
cross unity in a very narrow region in lwhere the σversuslplot in the log-log scale also shows a bending. Although,
a formal justiﬁcation to this correlation has not been provided, we have used this scale as an approximate measure
to exclude the bending regions from the slope analyses. Based on th is scale, we divide the DNA sequence into two
segments to extract the slope parameters. It is found that below this scale, the correlation is weak and the DNA
statistics is essentially Gaussian while above this all DNA sequences sh ow strong long range correlations irrespective
of their intron contents with a signiﬁcant deviation from the Gaussia n behavior. It may be mentioned here that the
controversies that exist in this ﬁeld of research are primarily due to diﬀerent approaches that are adopted in various
models. In this context, our analyses is model independent as it only involves the counting of an individual or a group
of nucleotides in a given length to build the density distribution. In this work, we do not advocate for any speciﬁc
model, although the extracted slope parameters indicate the pres ence of anomalous diﬀusion of both enhanced and
dispersive nature. Instead, we provide an elegant tool to measur e the degree of correlations unambiguously so that
the interpretation of the data including theoretical analyses will be come more meaningful. This work will also provide
further impetus to develop models for the understanding of the DN A dynamics.

APPENDIX: RANDOM WALK MODEL
The method of DNA walks, ﬁrst suggested by Peng et al [13] is based on the rule that the walker either moves
up (ui= 1) or down ui=−1) for each step iof the walk. This is the case of a correlated random walk and diﬀers
from an uncorrelated walk where the direction of each step is indepe ndent of the previous steps. Further they assign
ui= 1 if a pyrimidine occurs at the site iwhereas ui=−1 if the site contains a purine. The net displacement ( y) of
the walker after lsteps is deﬁned as
y(l) =l/summationdisplay
i=1u(i) (A1)
The standard deviation of the above quantity can be estimated fro m
σ2(l,L) =1
L−lL−l/summationdisplay
l0=1(∆y(l0,l)−¯∆(l))2(A2)
whereLis the number of nucleotides in the entire sequence and
¯∆y(l) =1
L−lL−l/summationdisplay
l0=1∆y(l0,l) (A3)
where ∆y(l0,l) =y(l0+l)−y(l0). It was found [13] that the ﬂuctuations can be approximated by
σ(l,L)∼lα(A4)
whereαis the correlation exponents. For αclose to 0 .5, there is no correlation or only short range correlation in the
sequence. If αis signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from 0 .5, it indicates long range correlations.
APPENDIX: B
In the previos analyses, we account for the non-occurenceof a p articular nucleotide. This is operationallyequivalent
to building the density spectrum Pnincluding n= 0. If the nucleotide compositional asymmetry is quite large like
SCMIT, the occurence ncan be zero for some nucleotides particularly at short distances. T herefore, we can build
Pndistribution either including or excluding zerothchannel. The ﬁgure B1(a) shows the comparison of σversusl
plot for two complimentary distributions corresponding to a LAMCG sequence both with (top panel where Gand
ATCdistributions have identical slopes at all scales) and without (botto m panel) inclusion of n= 0 channel in the
Pnspectra. Interestingly, absence of n= 0 channel does not satisfy the complimentarity relation particular ly at short
distances. However, the diﬀerence does not exist at larger distan ces where always n >1. Figure B1(b) shows another
example of Fqversuslplot for a typical SCMITsequence. The spectrum with exclusion of n= 0 channel behaves
diﬀerently when zerothchannel is included (compare it with ﬁgure 5 where Fqversuslhas no cross over).

FIG. B1. (a) The variance σversuslforG(solid curves) and ATCdistributions (dotted curves) for LAMCG sequence. Top
panel is for distribution for which the complimentarity is p reserved while complimentarity is not satisﬁed in the case o f bottom
panel particularly at small distances. (b) Fqversuslplot forGdistribution of SCMITfor the case when complimentarity is
not preserved. The curves are scaled up appropriately for be tter clarity.
Since the spectrum behaves diﬀerently when zerothchannel is not included, we have analysed the spectrum of three
typical sequences listed in the table below. Notice now that while α2values are essentially same as before, the α1
values are quite diﬀerent. In fact, we have noticed a general tren d whereα1is higer than the previous values although
the corresponding density distributions do not deviate signiﬁcantly from the Gaussian behavior at short distances.
However, in the previous analysis, we alwyas include the zerothchannel so that the complimentarity properties is
satisﬁed at all scales. Moreover, we also found a correlation betwe enαand Gaussian statistics, namely the deviation
ofαfrom 0.5 also shows a corresponding deviation of Pndistribution from Gaussian behavior. For example, in case of
SCMIT, theαis quite large at a short distance. Accordingly, the Pndistribution also shows strong deviation from
the Gaussian statistics. However, this is not necessarilly true when complimentarity is not preserved while building
the spectrum. At short distances, the deviation of αfrom 0.5 does not always mean a strong deviation from the
Gaussian statistics.
