Abstract. We study a mathematical model of a blood circulation network which is a
generalization of the coronary model proposed by Smith, Pullan and Hunter. We prove the
existence and uniqueness of the solution to the initial-boundary valu e problem and discuss
the continuity of dependence of the solution and its derivatives on in itial, boundary and
forcing functions and their derivatives.
1 Introduction
In a recent paper [13], Smith, Pullan and Hunter propose a mathemat ical model of blood
circulation in the coronary network, and conduct a numerical analy sis. In their model, major
vessels (with cross-sectional areas larger thana certain value) a re treated as a connected one-
dimensional network, andsmall vessels, such asarterioles, capillar ies andvenules, aretreated
as lumped elements which are connected to the network of vessels. The ﬂow on vessels are
assumed to be incompressible, homogeneous, Newtonian, and has a small Reynolds number.
Thus, the mass balance equation and Navier-Stokes equation can b e written to describe the
pressure and the ﬂow rate on vessels. Equations on lumped element s are written in analogy
with the current and voltage in an electric circuit. The result is an initia l-boundary value
problem of a system of hyperbolic type partial diﬀerential equation s coupled at junctions
of the network. Although the result of the numerical analysis cond ucted in [13] matches
closely with measured data, the well-posedness problem of the syst em of partial diﬀerential
equations, that is, the existence, uniqueness and the continuous dependence on initial and
boundary data of the solution, has not been established before. T he main objective of this
paper is to establish the well-posedness. We prove that the system is well-posed under
certain natural conditions. This work is an extension of our earlier w ork [12] on a model
of blood circulation in the brain. The main diﬀerences between the two models are that
the network conﬁguration in [12] is more complicated owing to the pre sence of Willis loops,
but the coupling junction conditions in the model of [13] are more com plicated due to the
diﬀerent formulation and the inclusion of the capillaries and veinal sys tem. We combine
both features in a more general system with the hope that our res ult will be useful in the
1
modelling of circulation systems of higher complexity, including the who le body circulation
system.
Before stating our system, let us brieﬂy describe the model in [13]. L etPiandRi
represent the pressure and radius on the i-th vessel, respectively, and let Vibe the cross-
sectional average of the axial component vi,xof the velocity on the i-th vessel. Assuming
that the radial component vi,rof the velocity is small compared to the axial component vi,x
of the velocity, one can write equations of mass balance

Also, by rescaling the spatial variable x, we may assume that each vessel is parameterized

The system of diﬀerential equations are supplemented with the initia l condition
Pi(x,0) =PI
i(x), Qi(x,0) =QI

and boundary conditions. Boundary conditions at each end of the v essel are given according

bifurcation point of one artery into two smaller ones or a joining point of two veins into a
bigger one. Our prescription allows more general conﬁguration of t he network, including the
presence of Willis loops.) If the end is a transitional junction , which connects the vessel to a
network of arterioles, capillaries and venules, we follow the so called microcirculation model
proposed in [13, 14]. Generalizing from [13], arterioles or venules conn ected to the vessel jl
are represented by a lumped resistive element Rjl. The capillary bed is also represented by
a resistive element RC.Rjl’s are connected to RCthrough capacitive elements C1andC2
on the two ends.

The system we study in this paper consists of the equations
∂Pi
∂t+ai∂Qi
∂x=fi,
∂Qi
∂t+bi∂Pi
∂x+2ci∂Qi
∂x=gi,x∈(0,1), t >0 (1.13)
and the initial and boundary conditions given by (1.5)–(1.12). For co nvenience, we also use
the vector form
(Ui)t+Bi(Ui)x=Fi (1.14)
whereUi= (Pi,Qi),Fi= (fi,gi) and
Bi=/parenleftbigg0ai

.
Eq. (1.4) is a special case of this system where

We do not assume any particular form of these functions though, t hey are general diﬀer-
entiable functions of ( x,t,Pi,Qi). Our basic assumptions are ai>0 andAi> ε0for some
positive constant ε0. Other assumptions will follow. Apart from the junction conditions,
this system is the same as the one we study in [12]. Also, the junction c onditions in [12] is
the special case of (1.8)–( 1.9) above with ρi= 0. As in [12], we use a ﬁxed point principle
to prove the solvability of the problem. Substituting a pair of functio ns (pi,qi) for (Pi,Qi) in
the coeﬃcients ai,bi,ci,Aiand forcing functions fi,gi, the system becomes linear. That is,
all the functions ai, etc. are independent of unknowns. If the linear system has a uniq ue so-
lution, then, one can establish a mapping from ( pi,qi) to the linear problem solution ( Pi,Qi).
If one also shows that this mapping has a unique ﬁxed point, then the ﬁxed point is neces-
sarily the unique solution of the quasilinear system. Hence, we shall ﬁ rst give a condition
for the linear system to have a unique solution, then examine under w hat conditions the
mapping has a unique ﬁxed point. The ﬁrst aspect of the problem is inv estigated in Section
2 and the second in Section 3. We also prove a result on the continuity of dependence of
solutions on the initial, boundary and forcing functions for linear and quasilinear systems,
thus, completing the analysis of the well-posedness of the problem. In spite of similarity in
parts of the analysis to the one used in [12], the more general branc hing junction condition
and the new transitional junction conditions require more careful treatments. Hence, there
are substantial variations in the analysis. For completeness and to beneﬁt the reader, we
include all the major arguments in this paper.

2 The linear system
In this section, we analyze (1.13) as a linear system with ai,bi,ci,fi,gi,Aiindependent of
PiandQi. The initial and boundary conditions are given by (1.5)–(1.12) excep t that the
junction condition (1.9) is substituted by the more general conditio n

∂t=Ajl(Pjl−Pjunc)+Cjl, ρjl′∂Qjl′
∂t=Ajl′/parenleftbig

+Cjl′(2.1)
whereCiare diﬀerentiable functions of ( x,t). The inclusion of Ciis needed in the next
section in order that the result of this section can be extended to t he quasilinear system.
We give conditions for the linear system to have a unique global solutio n. The conditions
are most naturally given in terms of the eigenvalues of the matrix Bi, which have the form
λR
i=ci+ui, λL
i=ci−ui,
where
ui=/radicalig
c2
i+aibi.
These eigenvalues are real if
c2
i+aibi>0, x∈(0,1), t >0, i= 1,...,n. (2.2)
In this case,
λR
i(x,t)>0, λL
i(x,t)< λR
i(x,t) (2.3)
and the system is hyperbolic. Under the condition (2.2), we show tha t the linear system has
a unique solution if
λL
i(0,t)<0, λL
i(1,t)<0, i= 1,...,n
which is equivalent to
aibi>0, t≥0, i= 1,...,n. (2.4)
atx= 0,1 only. It needs not hold for x∈(0,1).
Theorem 2.1 Assume that the functions ai,bi,ci,fi,gi,AiandCiare independent of
(Pi,Qi). Suppose that these functions and the initial and boundary f unctions PI
i,QI
i,PB
i,
QB
iall have bounded ﬁrst-order derivatives. Suppose also that ai>0,Ai>0and that the
conditions (2.2) and (2.4) hold. Then, for any T >0there is a unique solution in a bounded
subset of the space C([0,1]×[0,T],R2n)to the linear system (1.13) with the initial and
boundary conditions given by (1.5)–(1.8), (1.10)–(1.12), and (2.1).

Proof. We ﬁrst show that the system has a unique solution for 0 < t < δfor some δ >0.
The proof is based on the method of characteristics and a ﬁxed poin t principle. For systems
deﬁned on only one branch with boundary conditions of the forms of (1.6) or (1.7), this is a
standard approach. In our case, special care is needed to handle the junction conditions.
Consider the i-th branch. From any point ( ξ,τ) on the left, right, and lower boundary of
the rectangle D=: [0,1]×[0,T], we construct the left-going and right-going characteristic
curvesx=xL
i(t;ξ,τ) andx=xR
i(t;ξ,τ) by

i/parenleftbig
xR
i,t/parenrightbig
, xR
i(τ) =ξ,
respectively, where λL
iandλR
iare the two eigenvalues of the matrix Bi. By the uniqueness of
solutions to these diﬀerential equations, a left-going (resp. right -going) characteristic curve
cannot intersect with another left-going (resp. right-going) cha racteristic curve. Let XL
iand
XR
ibe the right-most left-going and left-most right-going character istic curves,
x=xL
i(t;1,0) andx=xR
i(t;0,0)
starting from the lower boundary of D, respectively. It can be shown from (2.3) that the
two curves can have at most one intersection. Let tibe the value of tat the intersection.
If the two curves do not intersect in D, we simply deﬁne ti=T. By condition (2.4), XL
i
cannot reach the right vertical line x= 1 at any t >0, and by λR
i>0,XR
icannot reach the
vertical line x= 0 at any t >0. Thus, the rectangle Di=: [0,1]×[0,ti] can be divided into
three parts

We show that there is a δi≤tisuch that the solution ( Pi,Qi) for the i-th branch exists in
the restriction of Dito the strip {0≤t≤δi}.
First, observe that the initial conditions alone determine the solutio n completely in the
central region DC
i. This follows from the theory of ﬁrst-order linear hyperbolic syste ms and
the fact that from any point ( x,t)∈DC
i, the two characteristic curves, followed backwards,
must land on the horizontal line t= 0. (The latter is a consequence of (2.3).) To extend
the solution to other parts of Di, we make a change of unknowns and derive a set of integral
equations. Note that lR
i=:/parenleftbig
−λL
i,ai/parenrightbig
andlL
i=:/parenleftbig
−λR
i,ai/parenrightbig
are the left eigenvectors of Bi
corresponding to λR
iandλL
i, respectively. Introduce new unknowns
ri=lR
iUi≡ −λL
iPi+aiQi, si=lL
iUi≡ −λR
iPi+aiQi. (2.5)
The system (1.13) can be written in terms of riandsiby multiplying the left eigenvectors
to (1.14) and substituting in
Pi=1

This results in the equations

(A diﬀerential operator acting on a vector means that it acts on ea ch component of the

characteristic curve xR(t;ξ,τ) which passes through ( x,t) and reaches the left or lower
boundary of Diat (ξ,τ). It can be shown that for ( x,t)∈DC
i∪DR
i,τ= 0, and for
(x,t)∈DL
i,ξ= 0. In the former case, we obtain

Similarly, by integrating the second equation of (2.7) along the left-g oing characteristic curve
xL
i(t;ξ,τ) that passes through both ( x,t) and (ξ,τ) (which is on either the right or lower
boundary of Di), the equations are

to the strip {0≤t≤δi}, respectively. First, consider the case where the end of the bran ch is
an external end. We discuss the case of a left end only, the case of a right end can be treated
similarly. If the boundary condition is given by (1.6), we deﬁne ˆ si=si/εwhereε <1 is any
constant. Using the ﬁrst equation of (2.6) in the integral equation s (2.11) and (2.12),

. In a standard approach,
it can be shown that Kis a contraction mapping if δiis suﬃciently small. Hence, the ﬁxed

the boundary condition is given by (1.7), we deﬁne ˆ si=si/ε, whereε >0 is so small such

By a similar argument, the solution can again be uniquely extended.
We next extend the solution to either DL

In this case, we shall extend the solution on all the branches that a re connected to the

I2is the 2×2 identity matrix, and B1,B2are some constant matrices. Since all the elements
of the diagonal matrices D1andD2are positive, the system can be uniquely solved for these
derivatives. Thus, each of dsjl(1,t)/dt,drjl′(0,t)/dtforl= 1,...,ν,l′=ν+1,...,µis a
linear combination of rjl(1,t),sjl(1,t),rjl′(0,t),sjl′(0,t), anddrjl(1,t)/dt,dsjl′(0,t)/dt,
l= 1,...,ν,l′=ν+ 1,...,µas well as PC1andPC2. We can also eliminate PC1andPC2
by (1.10). Integrating the resulting equations, we obtain equation s (2.17)–(2.18) for some
functions mi
j,ni
j, andHi. The remaining of the previous paragraph can then be used here
to give the extension of the solution to the left or right regions for t he branches.
Finally, if we let δbe the minimum of all δioccurring above, we see that δ >0 and the
solution exists and is unique in ( x,t)∈Dδ=: [0,1]×[0,δ]. Observe that δdepends only
on the bounds of the system functions ai, etc., the initial and boundary functions PI
i, etc.,
and their ﬁrst-order derivatives in D= [0,1]×[0,T]. Hence, it is independent of t, and we
can extend the solution successively in the time intervals [0 ,δ], [δ,2δ], etc. In this way, the
solution is obtained in Din ﬁnitely many steps.
We next derive an estimate of the deviation of solution in term of the d eviations of the
initial, boundary and forcing functions. This estimate is needed in the next section. For
any vector function v= (v1,...,v k) deﬁned in C/parenleftbig

Proof. We need only prove (2.21) for a δ≤mini{δi}, whereδirepresents the constants
occurring in the proof of Theorem 2.1. This is because for larger δ, we can divide the
interval [0 ,δ] into subintervals, each has a length less than min i{δi}, and apply (2.21) in
each subinterval. We can then take the maximum on each side of the in equalities to derive
the inequality of in [0 ,δ]. In the sequel, DC

We next extend the estimate to DL

a transitional junction. In either case, the solutions on the branc hesj1,...,j µconnecting to
the junction constitute a ﬁxed point of the operator K, which is deﬁned in (2.20). Let

(2.6).
3 The quasilinear system
In this section, we study the quasilinear system where the coeﬃcien tsai,bi,ci,fi,gi,Aiand
Cidepend on both ( x,t) and (Pi,Qi). Under certain conditions, we show that the system
has a unique local solution. We then present a theorem on the contin uity of dependence of
the solution on initial, boundary and forcing function.
Thebasicideaintheproofoftheexistenceofsolutionistoconstruc taniterativesequence.
Substituting any vector function ( pi,qi) for (Pi,Qi) inai, etc., the system becomes linear.
Thus, we can use Theorem 2.1 to get a solution ( Pi,Qi). This deﬁnes a mapping Sfrom
u=: (pi,qi) toU=: (Pi,Qi), and the solution for the quasilinear system is a ﬁxed point of
S. If there is a subset of a Banach space that is invariant under S, then, we can construct a
sequence
uk+1=Suk, k= 0,1,....
In the case where the limit exists and is unique, it gives rise to ﬁxed poin t ofS. This is our
approach in this section.
In this approach, conditions (2.2) and (2.4) are repeatedly used. O ne might want to
impose them for all the values of the variables. This would give the exis tence and uniqueness
for the global solution, as in the case of the linear system. However , such a requirement is
15
so restrictive that even the original system (1.4) cannot meet it. T herefore, we will impose
them only for t= 0, and obtain the local solution for the quasilinear system.
Theorem 3.1 Assume that the initial and boundary functions PI
i,QI
i,PB
i,QB
iand the
system functions ai,bi,ci,fi,gi,AiandCiall have continuous ﬁrst-order derivatives with
respect to each variable. Suppose that aiis positive and Aihas a positive lower bound for all
the values of their arguments, and that conditions (2.2)–(2 .4) hold at t= 0. Suppose also
that the initial functions PI
i,QI
isatisfy any relevant boundary conditions at t= 0. Then,
for some δ >0, there is a unique solution for 0≤t < δto the quasilinear system (1.13) with
the initial and boundary conditions given by (1.5)–(1.8), ( 2.1), and (1.10)–(1.12).
Proof. We ﬁrst consider the simpler case where UI=:/parenleftbig
PI,QI/parenrightbig
= 0. Let v={vi},
vi= (pi,qi) be a family of vector functions (not necessarily constitutes a solu tion) that
satisfy the initial and boundary conditions. Substitute vforUin the functions ai,bi,ci,fi,
gi,AiandCi. Then, the system becomes linear and we can invoke Theorem 2.1 to o btain
a solution Uto the linear system. This deﬁnes a mapping S:v/mapsto→U. A solution to the
quasilinear system is then a ﬁxed point of S. We will choose a subset Xδ,M0of a Banach
space such that (1) SXδ,M0⊂Xδ,M0, and (2) Sis contracting in Xδ,M0. For any scalar
or vector function f∈Ck(Dδ), let|f|k,δdenote the maximum norm of all the k-th order
derivatives of finDδ. (Iffis a vector function, |f|k,δ= max i/braceleftig
|fi|k,δ/bracerightig
.) LetCB(Dδ,R2n)
denote the subset of the vector-valued functions in C(Dδ,R2n) that satisfy the initial and
boundary conditions. We seek Xδ,M0in the form
Xδ,M0=/braceleftig
v∈CB/parenleftbig
Dδ,R2n/parenrightbig
:|v|0,δ≤M0,|v|1,δ≤M1/bracerightig
(3.1)
whereM0is an arbitrary positive constant and M1is a constant to be determined. Note
that by the vanishing initial condition, for any M1,|U|1,δ≤M1implies|U|0,δ≤M1δ. Hence,
for anyM0, we can ensure |U|0,δ≤M0by reducing δ. It remains, therefore, only to show
that for M1suﬃciently large and δsuﬃciently small, |v|1,δ≤M1implies|Sv|1,δ≤M1.
Throughout this proof, we use Mto represent any positive constant that may depend on M1
but is otherwise independent of vandδ, and use ˜Mfor any constant that is independent of
M1,vandδ. The values of Mor˜Min diﬀerent occurrences need not be equal.
LetU=Svand letriandsibe deﬁned by (2.5). On each branch, we show that
max{|(ri)x|,|(si)x|,} ≤M1 (3.2)
and
max{|(ri)t|,|(si)t|} ≤M1 (3.3)
16
inDC
δ,DL
δandDR
δifM1is large and δis small. (Recall that DC
δetc. are the intersections
DC
i∩Dδetc., respectively.) In fact, only (3.2) needs to be shown. To see th is, ﬁrst ob-
serve that the vanishing initial condition and the compatibility of the in itial and boundary
conditions gives

Hence, we obtain from Lemma 2.1 with ˜U= 0 that
|U|0,δ≤Mδ. (3.4)
From (2.7) and (2.9), there are constants ˜MandMsuch that
/vextendsingle/vextendsingle∂R

ilL
i/vextendsingle/vextendsingle|Ui| ≤˜M+Mδ(3.5)
for eachi= 1,...,n. Hence, (3.3) follows from (3.2), (3.5) and the deﬁnition of ∂L
iand∂R

in (2.8). We also note that (2.6) and (3.5) imply

δfori=j1,...,j νand inDL
δfori=jν+1,...,j µifM1is suﬃciently large and δis
suﬃciently small. We have thus proved (3.2) in this case.
This completes the proof of (3.2) in all cases. By choosing appropria te values of M1and
δ, we thus obtain a set Xδ,M0in the form of (3.1) which is invariant under the mapping S.
We now show that Sis a contraction in Xδ,M0. LetU=Sv,˜U=S˜vfor some v,˜v∈Xδ,
and letW=U−˜U.Wsatisﬁes the vanishing initial and external boundary conditions and

M1, there is a constant Msuch that

0,δ≤M|v−˜v|0,δ
Hence, by Theorem 2.1,
|Sv−S˜v|0,δ≤Mδ|v−˜v|0,δ.
Therefore, Sis contracting in Xδ,M0ifδis suﬃciently small.
The rest is standard (cf. e.g., [6]). Starting with a v0∈Xδ,M0, we generate an iterative
sequence vk+1=Svk. Clearly, each vklies inXδ,M0and the sequence converges uniformly.
The limit then satisﬁes the integral equations in the proof of Theore m 2.1, and hence, is
diﬀerentiable. Therefore, it is the solution of the quasilinear diﬀeren tial equations. This
proves the existence and uniqueness of the solution when UI= 0.
IfUI/ne}ationslash= 0, we regard UIas a vector function of xandtand introduce ˜U=U−UI. It
follows that ˜Uis a solution of the quasilinear equations (1.13) with the forcing funct ions˜fi
and ˜gigiven by
˜fi=fi−/parenleftbig

and
˜Cjl=Cjl+AjlPI
jl,˜Cjl′=Cjl′−Ajl′PI
jl′
forl= 1,...,ν,l′=ν+1,...,µ. Since˜Uhas the vanishing initial values, it can be uniquely
solved for an interval of t∈[0,δ]. This gives rise to a solution U.
Remark: Examples can be constructed to show that if the condition (2.4) fails att= 0,
then, the local solution need not exist or may be not unique. In part icular, if (2.4) fails at
a source end, then, the system is under-determined, and if it fails a t a terminal end, the
system is over-determined.
We give next a result for the continuity of dependence of the solutio n and its derivatives
on the initial, boundary and forcing functions and their derivatives. This follows from an
argument similar to the proofs of Lemma 2.1 and Theorem 3.1.
Corollary 3.1 LetU= (P,Q)and˜U=/parenleftig
˜P,˜Q/parenrightig
be two solutions of the quasilinear problem
of Theorem 3.1. Suppose the conditions of that theorem hold f or the initial and boundary

boundary and forcing functions, such that

(3.16)
fork= 0,1.
Proof. Fork= 0, the result follows from substituting one of the solutions into the coeﬃ-
cients, modifying the forcing functions by (3.14)–(3.15), and using Lemma 2.1. For k= 1, we
diﬀerentiate the equations and apply the lemma to the resulting equa tions for the derivatives
of the solution. The process is standard and is omitted.
