Abstract
Helix-coil transitions in poly-alanine molecules of lengt h 10 are studied by
multicanonical Monte Carlo simulations. The solvation eﬀec ts are included
by either a distance-dependent dielectric permittivity or by a term that is
proportional to the solvent-accessible surface area of the peptide. We found a
strong dependence of the characteristics of the helix-coil transition from the
details of the solvation model.

1 Introduction
There has been recently a renewed interest in the conditions under whichα-helices,
a common structure in proteins, are formed or dissolved. It is long k nown thatα-
helices undergo asharptransitiontowards arandomcoil statewhe nthetemperature
is increased. The characteristics of this so-called helix-coil transit ion have been
studied extensively [1], most recently in Refs. [2, 3]. In Refs. [4, 5] ev idence was
presented thatthehelix-coil transitioninpolyalanineexhibits atrue thermodynamic
phase transition when interactions between all atoms in the molecule are taken into
account [4, 5].
Thelaterresultswereobtainedfromgas-phasesimulationsofpoly- alanine. While
thereissomeexperimental evidence [6]supportingthenumerical r esultsofthese gas-
phase simulations, the question remains how these results relate to the biologically
more relevant case of solvated molecules. First investigations of th is question were
described in Refs.[7, 8] where it was claimed that the transition tempe rature is lower

in water than in vacuum. However, that investigation relies on a single represen-
tation of the protein-water interaction and the dependence of th eir results on the
details of the solvation term is not clear.
In this paper, we have investigated how the characteristics of helix -coil transition
change with the details of the solvation term. For this purpose, we h ave performed
multicanonical simulations of polyalanine molecules of length 10. The pr otein-water
interaction was included in two ways: either by a distance-dependen t dielectric per-
mittivity or by a term that is proportional to the solvent-accessible surface area of
the peptide. For the later case we have considered four diﬀerent p arameter sets:
OONS [9], JRF [10], W92 [11] and SCH [12]. Quantities such as the energy, helicity
and susceptibility were calculated as function of temperature. Our result were com-
pared with that of gas phase simulations. A strong dependence of t he characteristics
of the helix-coil transition from the details of the solvation term was found.
2 Methods
Our investigation of the helix-coil transition for polyalanine is based o n a detailed,
all-atom representation of that homopolymer. The interaction bet ween the atoms
was described by a standard force ﬁeld, ECEPP/2,[13] (as implement ed in the pro-
gram package SMMP [14]) and is given by:

Here,rij(in˚A) is the distance between the atoms iandj, andχlis thel-th torsion
angle. We have chosen ECEPP/2 instead of the newer ECEPP/3 diﬀer s because
this choice allows a more easy comparison with our previous work. Bot h force ﬁelds
diﬀer from each other only in the way in which prolines and end groups a re treated.
In preliminary polyalanine simulations we found no qualitative diﬀerence s in our
results when ECEPP/3 was used instead of ECEPP/2 (data not show n).

The interactions between our homo-oligomer and water are approx imated by
means of two implicit water models. In the ﬁrst model (DDE) the elect rostatic
interactions in the presence of water rely on a distance dependent electrostatic per-
mittivity [15]:
ε(r) =D−D−2
2[(sr)2+2sr+2]e−sr. (6)
For the parameters Dandsempirical values are chosen such that for large distances
the permittivity takes the value of bulk water ( ε≈80), and the value ε= 2 for short
distances (protein interior space). Equation (6) is the result of int erpolation of two
types of interactions. For short distances it models the interactio n of two charges
placed in continuum medium, while over long distances it represents a D ebye curve.
This is clearly a gross over-simpliﬁcation of protein-solvent interact ions. However,
approximating solvation eﬀects by a distance-dependent dielectric permittivity was
used by many authors to study the proteins and nucleic acids (e.g. [1 6]) since it
does not signiﬁcantly slow down protein simulations below that of simple in vacuo
simulations.
Inanothercommonapproximationoftheprotein-solvent interact iononeassumes
that the free energy contributions from atomic groups immersed in the protein in-
terior diﬀer from contributions of groups exposed to the water. I t is commonly
accepted [9, 11, 17, 18] that this free-energy diﬀerence is propo rtional to the surface
area of the atomic group which is exposed to the solvent. Within this a pproxima-
tion, the total solvation energy of a protein is given by the sum of co ntributions
from each solvated atomic groups:
Esol=/summationdisplay
iσiAi, (7)
whereEsolis the solvation energy, Aiis the conformational dependent solvent acces-
sible area of the surface of the i−thatom andσiis the atomic solvation parameter
for the atom i. The summation is extended over all atomic groups. The solvation
parameters are evaluated experimentally by measuring the free en ergy needed to
bring the group from a nonpolar environment (usually octanol or et hanol are used
as convenient compounds) into water. Many sets of solvation para meters were eval-
uated by several authors with diﬀerent methods, but unfortuna tely it is not always
obvious which one isthemost appropriateone. The sets we study he re arenamed by
us OONS [9], JRF [10], W92 [11] and SCH [12], and are described in the resp ective
references.

Simulations of detailed models of biological macromolecules are notorio usly dif-
ﬁcult. This is because the various competing interactions within the p olymer lead
to an energy landscape characterized by a multitude of local minima. Hence, in
the low-temperature region, canonical Monte Carlo or molecular dy namics simu-
lations will tend to get trapped in one of these minima and the simulation will
not thermalize within the available CPU time. Only recently, with the intr oduc-
tion of new and sophisticated algorithms such as multicanonical sampling [19] and
othergeneralized-ensemble techniques [20] was it possible to alleviate this problem
in protein simulations [21]. For polyalanine, both the failure of standar d Monte
Carlo techniques and the superior performance of the multicanonic al algorithm are
extensively documented in earlier work [22]. For this reason, we use a gain this
sophisticated simulation technique for our project.
In the multicanonical algorithm [19] conformations with energy Eare assigned
a weightwmu(E)∝1/n(E). Here,n(E) is the density of states. A simulation with
this weight will lead to a uniform distribution of energy:
Pmu(E)∝n(E)wmu(E) = const. (8)
This is because the simulation generates a 1D random walk in the energ y space,
allowing itself to escape from any local minimum. Since a large range of e nergies are
sampled, one can use the reweighting techniques [23] to calculate th ermodynamic
quantities over a wide range of temperatures Tby
<A>T=/integraltextdxA(x)w−1(E(x))e−βE(x)
/integraltextdxw−1(E(x))e−βE(x), (9)
wherexstands for conﬁgurations.
Unlike in the case of canonical simulations the weights
w(E) =n−1(E) =e−S(E)(10)
are not a priori known. Instead estimators for these weights hav e to be determined.
This is often done by an iterative procedure in which for reasons of n umerical sta-
bility Eq. 10 is replaced by
w(E) =e−β(E)E−α(E). (11)
The multicanonical parameters β(E) andα(E) are deﬁned through
β(E) =S(E′)−S(E)
E′−Eandα(E) =/braceleftBigg
0 , E≥Emax
α(E′)+(β(E′)−β(E))E′, E <E max
(12)
4
withEandE′adjacent bins in the array S(E). Theβ(E) are then iteratively
updated [24] by the relation
βi+1(E) =βi(E)+g0(E)·/parenleftBig
lnHi(E′)−lnHi(E)/parenrightBig
/(E′−E),(13)
in whichHi(E) is the histogram of the i-th run (and H(E)≥1). In Ref. [24] the
factorg0(E) in Eq. 13 was deﬁned through
g0(E) =ˆgi(E)
ˆgi(E)+/summationtexti−1
jˆgj(E)with ˆgi(E) =Hi(E′)·Hi(E)
Hi(E′)+Hi(E).(14)
The above relation assumes that the histogram H(E) counts independent events
which is in general not true. Hence, it is more appropriate and leads t o a faster
convergence of β(E) if the array ˆ gi(E) in Eq. 14 is instead deﬁned by
ˆgi(E) =Ki(E′)Ki(E)
Ki(E′)+Ki(E)(15)
where the auxiliary array K(E) now counts only the number of independent visits
at energyE.
With the above described iterative procedure we needed 200,000 sw eeps for the
weight factor calculations. All thermodynamic quantities were then estimated from
one production run of 1 ,000,000 Monte Carlo sweeps starting from a random initial
conformation, i.e. without introducing any bias.
3 Results and Discussion
In previous gas-phase simulations of poly-alanine [3, 4, 5, 22] we obs erved atT=
430Ka pronounced transition between a high-temperature phase domin ated by dis-
orderedcoil structures andanorderedphasewithsingle, extend ed helices. Anatural
order parameter for this helix-coil transition is the average numbe r< nH(T)>of
residues in the oligomer which are part of an α−helix. Following earlier work [22]
we deﬁne a residue as helical if the pair of backbone dihedral angles φ,ψtakes a
value in the range ( −70±20,−37±20). In Fig. 1a this order parameter is displayed
as function of temperature for a gas-phase simulation (GP) of Ala 10and simulations
with the various solvation terms. Fig. 1b shows the corresponding p lots for the
susceptibility χ(T) deﬁned by
χ(T) =<n2
H(T)>−<nH(T)>2. (16)
5
In Fig. 1a and 1b the curves, representing the various simulations, fall into
three groups. For the case where the protein-solvent interactio n was approximated
by a distance-dependent permittivity (DDE), both < nH>andχhave a similar
temperature dependence than is observed for poly-alanine in gas- phase simulations
(GP). However, the transition temperature Tcis shifted from T= 435±20 K (gas-
phase) to a highervalueT= 495±20. This temperature was determined from the
maximum of the susceptibility χ(T) in Fig. 1b and is listed in table 1. To the same
group belong the simulations in which the solvation energy was approx imated by
a solvent accessible surface term with either the OONS [9] or SCH [12] parameter
set. In both cases susceptibility χand order parameter < nH(T)>show also a
temperature dependence similar to the one of gas-phase simulation s. Only now,
the transition temperature Tcis shifted to lowertemperatures. The corresponding
transitiontemperatures canbeagaindetermined fromtheposition softhemaximum
inχ(T) and are also listed in table 1. The shift towards lower temperatures was one
of the main results reported in Refs. [7, 8] for simulations with the OO NS solvation
energy, and our Tc= 345±20 K agrees well with their value Tc= 340 K (no errors
quoted) in Refs. [7, 8].
A somehow diﬀerent behavior is observed in the simulation where the p rotein-
water interaction was approximated by a solvent accessible surfac e term relying on
the W92 [11] parameter set. Here, the form of <nH>indicates only partial helix
formation and occurs only at much lower temperatures. The susce ptibilityχ(T) in
Fig. 1b gives no indication for a helix-coil transition. For this reason n o value ofTc
is listed for the W92 parameter set in table 1. Instead, we observe in Fig. 2 for this
case at low temperatures even the appearance of residues whose backbone dihedral
anglesφ,ψtake values typical for a β-sheet (−150±30,150±30).
Yet another behavior is observed in simulations where the solvation e nergy of
Eq. 7 is evaluated by means of the JRF parameter set. No formation of helices
or sheets is observed in Figs. 1 and 2. Since no transition temperatu re can be
determined, we do not list a value of Tcfor the JRF parameter set in table 1.
The same grouping can be found in Fig. 3a-f where we display various e nergy
terms as a function of temperature. In these ﬁgures we have shif ted the solvation
energies and the partial ECEPP/2 energies EC,ELJ,EHBandEtorof Eq. 5 by a
constant term such that we have for all solvation models at T= 1000 KEsol= 0 and
EC=ELJ=EHB=Etor= 0. Such a shift by an irrelevant constant allows a better
comparison of the diﬀerent simulations. The average total energy < Etot>which
6
is the sum of intramolecular potential energy EECEEP/ 2and the solvation energy
Esol, is displayed in Fig. 3a. We observe again that simulations with the para meters
sets OONS and SCH, and such with distant dependent permittivity (D DE), have
a similar temperature dependence as gas phase simulations (GP). On the other
hand, in simulations relying on the W92 parameter set, the energy va ries less with
temperature and is at low temperatures considerably higher than in the simulations
with other solvation energy terms. Finally, the energy in simulations w ith the JRF
parameter set is an almost linear function of temperature and is esp ecially at high
temperatures much lower than the energies found in gas phase simu lations.
The dissimilar behavior of energy for simulations with diﬀerent solvatio n terms
is even more obvious in Fig. 3b where the average intramolecular ener gyEECEPP/ 2
is drawn. While this energy term decreases between 1000 K and 150 K by≈50
Kcal/mol (with most of that change, ≈30 Kcal/mol, happing around the respective
transition temperature Tc) in gas-phase simulations (GP) and in simulations with
OONS, SCH and DDE solvation terms, it changes in the same temperat ure interval
only by≈20 Kcal/mol in simulations utilizing the JRF or W92 parameter sets.
Since for these two parameter sets also no or only little helix formatio n was observed
it seems likely that the formation of helices is related to the large gain in potential
energy observed for GP, OONS,SCH and DDE simulations. This gain in po tential
energy is in part due to the formation of hydrogen bonds between a residue and
the fourth following one in the polypeptide chain which stabilize an α-helix. Fig. 3c
displays the average hydrogen-bonding energy < EHB>of Eq. 5 as a function of
temperature and one can clearly see the gain in energy for the GP, D DE, OONS and
SCH simulations at the respective helix-coil transition temperature s of table 1. No
such gainis observed in W92 andJRFsimulations where also no helix form ationwas
found. A similar gain in energy with helix formations in gas-phase and sim ulations
with DDE,OONS and SCH solvent representations is also observed for the average
Lennard-Jones energy < ELJ>and the electrostatic energy < EC>displayed in
Fig. 3d and 3e, respectively. Note also in Fig. 3e the large gain in ECfor DDE at
the helix-coil transition temperature which additionally stabilizes the α-helix in this
model.
A complementary picture is found in Fig. 3f where the solvation energ yEsol
is shown as a function of temperature. The observed helix formatio n in gas phase
simulationsandsuchwithOONS,SCHandDDEsolvent representations iscorrelated
with an increases of the solvation energies by ≈5 Kcal/mol. On the other hand,
7
in simulations with the W92 and JRF parameter sets, for which no helix- formation
was observed in Fig. 1, Esoldecreases with temperature. This decrease is only ≈5
kcal/mol for W92, but it is much larger (of order 30 kcal/mol) in the ca se of JRF
where the solvation energy is the dominant term.
TheeﬀectsofthedominantsolvationterminsimulationswiththeJRFp arameter
set can also be seen in Fig. 4. In this ﬁgure the average radius of gyr ation, a measure
for the compactness of conﬁgurations, is shown as a function tem perature. One can
see that this quantity changes little with temperature for the JRF d ata. However,
its value is over the whole temperature range considerably smaller th an observed in
the other simulations. This indicates that the JRF solvation term fav ors already at
high temperatures compact conﬁgurations, and that the pressu re towards compact
structure is such that the more elongated helices cannot be forme d. Note however,
that the tendency towards compact conﬁgurations does not lead to a lower Lennard-
Jones energy ELJas one would expect. Fig. 3d indicates that < ELJ>is at low
temperatures in JRF simulations even larger than in GP, DDE, OONS an d SCG
simulations where helix-formation was observed. The tendency tow ards compact
structures in JRF simulations may be due to the fact that JRF param eter set was
developed from minimum energy (i.e. compact) conformations of pep tides (the
low-energy conformations of 13 tetrapeptides derived by NMR stu dies [10]), and
therefore this parameter set may have an intrinsic bias towards co mpact structures.
On the other hand, the W92 parameter set was developed from mea surements of
free energies of amino acid side chain analogs from vapor to water [26 ]. The param-
eters for this set are negative for all atoms except carbon meanin g that the nitrogen,
oxygen and sulfur atoms are considered hydrophilic, i.e. favoring so lvent exposure.
This explains not only the small solvation energies observed for this p arameter set
in Fig. 3f, but also why in Fig. 4 the radius of gyration is consistently lar ger for
this parameter set than for the others indicating that extended c onﬁgurations are
favored with this parameter set. This bias towards extended stru ctures limits again
the formation of α-helices.
While the OONS parameter set was derived from experimental free e nergies of
gas-to-water transfer of small aliphatic and aromatic molecules, t he SCH is not
directly based on experimental free energy data. Instead, it was developed as an
optimized parameter set to complement the CHARMM force ﬁeld [25]. I n both
parameter sets the hydrophobic character of the carbon atoms is increased and the
hydrophilic character of uncharge oxygen and nitrogen atoms dec reased resulting
8
into the large solvation energies of these two parameter sets (whe n compared with
the one of the W92 parameter set) that one observes in Fig. 3f. Th e OONS andSCH
solvation energies again favor extended structures (the radius o f gyration has larger
values than found in gas-phase simulations), however, the interpla y of solvation
energies and intramolecular ECEPP/2 energy is such that the radius of gyrations
(and consequently the compactness) of polyalanine conﬁguration s as a function of
temperature shows a similar behavior as the gas-phase simulation. T he same is true
for the DDE simulation where the protein-solvent interaction was ap proximated by
a distance-dependent permittivity.
Our results demonstrate that the helix formation is due to the gain in poten-
tial (intramolecular) energy while (with the exception of the JRF par ameter set)
the solvent-accessible surface terms favor extended peptide co nﬁgurations. Table 2
summarizes the diﬀerences in total energy ∆ Etot, solvation energy ∆ Esol, poten-
tial energy ∆ EECEEP/ 2, and the partial energies ∆ EC, ∆ELJ, ∆EHBand ∆Etor
between complete helical conﬁgurations (all residues with exceptio n of the terminal
ones are part of an α-helix) and coil conﬁgurations at temperature T= 300 K for
gas-phase, DDE OONS and SCH simulations. Note, that the intramole cular energy
diﬀerences ∆ EECEPP/ 2of gas-phase, OONS and SCH simulations have within their
error bars the same values. For simulations with the W92 parameter set the longest
found helix consists of 6 consecutive residues. Hence, we measure d for this case only
the energy diﬀerence between conﬁgurations with at least three c onsecutive helical
residues (i.e. one turn of an α-helix) and coil conﬁgurations. This modiﬁed deﬁni-
tion of the energy diﬀerences is also the reason for the smaller value of ∆EECEPP/ 2
listed for W92 in table 2. We do not list energy diﬀerences for the JRF p arameter
set since no helices were found in simulations utilizing this parameter se t.
Note that in simulations with distant dependent permittivity (DDE) he lices are
energetically more favored than in the gas-phase simulations. This is due to the
increased contribution from the Coulomb term ECas one can also see in Fig. 3e.
The larger energy gap between helical and coil conformations (whe n compared with
gas-phase simulations) explains why the transition temperature is h igher in DDE
simulations than in gas-phase simulations.
FortheOONSandtheSCHparametersetthesolvationenergydiﬀer ence∆Esolis
positive (indicating that coil structures are energetically favored ), but its magnitude
isonlyapproximatelyhalfthatofthepotentialenergydiﬀerence∆ EECEPP/ 2. Hence,
there is still an overall energetic gain connected with helix formation . However,
9
in both cases the total energy diﬀerence between helical and coil c onﬁgurations is
reduced by the solvationenergy when compared withthe gas-phas e simulation. This
reduction of the energy gap leads to the lower transition temperat ures observed in
OONS and SCH simulations.
On the other hand, for the W92 parameter set we ﬁnd that ∆ EECCP/ 2and
∆Esolare of same magnitude so that helical conﬁgurations are not or only weakly
energetically favored. This is consistent with our results in Fig. 1a an d 1b where
we ﬁnd atT= 280 K a high average helicity in OONS and SCH simulations but
only a small value of < nH>and no indications for a helix-coil transition in W92
simulations. An evaluation of energy diﬀerences was not possible for simulations
with the JRF parameter set since no helices were found.
The above results indicate that the existence and characteristics of the helix-coil
transition in polyalanine depend strong on the details of the solvent r epresentation.
In order to evaluate the validity of the diﬀerent solvent models one h as to compare
the numerical results with experimental data. For this purpose we have calculated
the helix propagation parameter swhich was also determined by experiments [28,
29]. According to the Zimm-Bragg model [27] the average number of helical residues

peratureT= 280 K for gas-phase and the diﬀerent solvation models. Our values are
summarized in table 3 which also lists our σvalues. Our results for gas-phase, DDE
and OONS simulations are in agreement with the experimental results of Ref. [29]
where they list values of s(Ala) between 1 .5 and 2.19. On the other hand, the s
value obtained in the SCH simulation agrees well with the one obtained b y the host-
guest technique of Ref. [28]. However, the svalues which were obtained in W92 or
JRF simulations do not agree with either of the experimental data. H ence, we con-
clude that the W92 and JRF parameter sets are not appropriate so lvation models
in simulations of polyalanine. Otherwise, the variation in the experimen tal data is
10
too large to give indications whether one of the remaining solvent rep resentations
(DDE, OONS, SCH or even no solvent at all (GP)) is preferable over t he others.
4 Conclusions
We have performed multicanonical simulations of polyalanine. The intr amolecular
forces were modeled by the ECEPP/2 force ﬁeld and various approx imations for the
solvation energy were studied. We observed that whether a helix-c oil transition is
observed for poly-alanine, and at what temperature, depends st rongly on the chosen
approximation for the protein-solvent interaction. Our results de monstrate both the
importance (and need) of including solvation terms into protein simula tions and the
diﬃculties in chosing an adequate representation of the protein-wa ter interactions.
Especially when using the solvent-accessible surface approach, it s eems necessary to
carefullychoosea parameterset that issuitable fortheproblemun der consideration.
Use of a speciﬁc parameter set without further justiﬁcation could otherwise generate
miss-leading results.
