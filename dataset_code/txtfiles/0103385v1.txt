Abstract
A protein model with the pairwise interaction energies vary ing as local en-
vironment changes, i.e., including some kinds of collectiv e eﬀect between the
contacts, is proposed. Lattice Monte Carlo simulations on t he thermody-
namical characteristics and free energy proﬁle show a well- deﬁned two-state
behavior and cooperativity of folding for such a model. As a c omparison,
related simulations for the usual G¯ o model, where the inter action energies
are independent of the local conformations, are also made. O ur results in-
dicate that the evolution of interactions during the foldin g process plays an
important role in the two-state cooperativity in protein fo lding.

Due to the developments of experimental methods andtheoretica l models, many achieve-
ments of protein folding have been made recently [1]. A protein can fo ld itself to its uniquely
well-deﬁned native structure in a biologically short time, regardless o f the huge number of
possible conformations, showing a highly cooperatively kinetic behav ior. It is now clear that
thecooperativityoffoldingmay result fromthebackbone hydroge nbonding, sidechain pack-
ing and hydrophobic interactions, among them the hydrophobic inte ractions are believed to
be the dominant driving force for folding [2]. For many small single-dom ain proteins or
lattice proteinlike models, there is a two-state behavior between th e unfolded states and the
folded native one [3,4]. Recently, Chan and Kaya [5] indicated that acc ording to the calori-
metric criterion, which is widely used in experiments as a condition for t wo-state folding,
popular lattice models, e.g., two-letter HP and 20-letter MJ models, a re far from two-state
models. Thismay beduetosome ﬂawed assumptions inthepotentialf unctions usedinthese
models. Lattice models usually use statistical potential functions e xtracted from the pair-
ing frequencies of 20 kinds of amino acids in databases of protein str uctures [6]. Although
these knowledge-based potentials may be a good approximation to t he relative strength of
interactions between the residues in the native state, they provid e no information about
how the interactions evolve during the folding. For computational c onvenience, a common
assumption in lattice models is that the interactions are additive, and they are the same
during the folding as in the native state. This means that the interac tion energies are
conformation-independent. Clearly this is not relevant to the expe rimental situation [7]. In
fact, as Dill pointed out [8], the thermodynamic additivity principle whic h is widely used in
chemistry may be unsuitable in biochemistry. Some recent experimen ts also indicated that
the transition state is an expanded version of the native state, wh ere the majority of inter-
actions are partially formed [9], and their strengths are diﬀerent fr om those in the native
state (with Φ <1). That is, these interactions depend on the conformations [7], es pecially
the local structures around the contacts as emphasized recent ly in Ref. [10]. Previously, the
non-additivity was built in a lattice model for packing eﬀects [11]; and t he hydrophobic force
depending on the local density of peptide atoms was also taken into a ccount in an oﬀ-lattice
2
model [12]. Studies on these models show that the introduction of th e non-additivity is
signiﬁciant, but the two-state cooperativity of these models is not checked, and the eﬀects
of the non-additivity on thermodynamics and kinetics of folding need to be further studied.
In this paper, we develop a reﬁned G¯ o model where the pairwise inte raction energies
vary as the local environment changes, i.e., some kinds of collective e ﬀects between contacts
are introduced. Our purpose here is to study the two-state coop erativity of protein folding
and its physical origin with such a model. Our results give a general pic ture about how the
conformation-dependent interactions aﬀect the folding kinetics, which is consistent with the
phenomenological explanation based on experimental results.
We model a polypeptide chain as a self-avoiding chain on a cubic lattice. A contact is
formed if two residues are space adjacent but not sequence adja cent. If two residues form a
contact as the same as in the native state, we call this contact a na tive contact, otherwise
a non-native contact. Following the G¯ o model [13], only native conta cts are considered to
contribute to the total energy. Diﬀerent from the G¯ o model, we a ssume that the interaction
energies between residues are conformation-dependent, and va ry with changes of the local
environment. Toachieve this, weintroduceaparameter Stodescribethedegreeforaresidue
being ordered relative to the native state. For the i-th residue in a certain conformation, its
degree of order Siis deﬁned as
Si=zi/znat
i, (1)
whereziis the number of native contacts in this conformation, znat
iis the number of contacts
formed in the native state. Obviously, Sivaries between 0 (the i-th residue being fully
disordered) and 1 (being fully ordered). Thus, the interaction ene rgy between residues iand
j,Bij=-(Si+Sj)ε/2 is deﬁned, where SiandSjare the degrees of order for residues iandj,
respectively. εis the unit of energy and is set to be 1 in this work. The total energy o f the
conformation then is E=/summationtext
i<j∆ijBij, where ∆ is unity when residues iandjform a native
contact, and zero otherwise. Here, a contact formed between r esiduesiandjmay have
diﬀerent energies in diﬀerent conformations, i.e., Bijmay change from one conformation to
3
another (for the G¯ o model, one always has Bij=−ε). In general, a contact formed between
residues iandjwill stabilize, to some extent, other contacts that residue iorjformed
with other residues. On the contrary, its breakage may destabilize those contacts as well.
Therefore, the introduction of the degree of order for a residue into the potential function
reﬂects the cooperativity between the residues. Although the co rrelation distance is small,
only one lattice unit, the many-body eﬀects are obviously included in o ur model. Figure 1
shows such a collective eﬀect. The interaction energies of contact A-B (or B-C) are diﬀerent
when the other contact is present or not present. Clearly, the en ergy of state I3is lower than
the sum of that of states I1andI2, indicating the interaction non-additivity. Each contact
is stabilized by the other contact due to the collective eﬀect. Note t hat in this paper our
model is called G¯ o+ model to distinguish from the G¯ o model.
Now let us present the Monte Carlo simulations on the thermodynamic and kinetic
features for both models. The mean ﬁrst passage time (MFPT), as a common measure of
folding rate, is calculated by an average of the ﬁrst passage time (F PT) over 1000 runs.
Each run begins with a random conformation, and ends when the nat ive state is reached for
the ﬁrst time. The FPT is the Monte Carlo steps (MCS) consumed in a r un.
Generally, as the temperature Tdecreases, the population of the native state, PN, in-
creases from zero to about unity. The degree of sharpness of ch anges in PN, similar to the
“rapidity” in Ref. [14], is a measure of the cooperativity of the folding reaction. Figure 2
shows the population PNand the speciﬁc heat Cvversus temperature Tfor a 36-mer chain
for both models. PNis deﬁned as PN=e−EN/T//summationtext
EΩ(E)e−E/T, where Ω( E) is the density
of states for energy E,ENis the energy of the native state. Ω( E) is calculated with the
Monte Carlo histogram method [15]. From Fig.2 we can see that the fold ing transition for
our G¯ o+ model is much sharper than that of the G¯ o model, i.e., a sha rper change in PN.
There is also a single peak in Cvcurve, but it is narrower than that of the G¯ o model. For
our G¯ o+ model, the maximum of Cvoccurs at a temperature nearly the midpoint tempera-
ture of transition with PN=1/2, i.e., the diﬀerence between these two temperatures is quite
small. This is consistent with recent studies on naturally occuring pro teins [14,16], implying
4
a good cooperativity of folding in this model. Diﬀerently, such a tempe rature diﬀerence is
large for the G¯ o model (see Fig.2), indicating that the folding of the G¯ o model is much less
cooperative than that of the G¯ o+ model. Since the sharpness is on ly a qualitative descrip-
tion for the transition, we further calculate the equilibrium energy d istribution at the folding
transition temperature, Tf. Figure 3 shows such distributions for both models. Clearly our
G¯ o+ model shows a goodbimodal behavior, and the denatured-st ate energy is distributed in
a narrow region [see Fig. 3(a)]. This means clearly a two-state folding and there is basically
no intermediate states at equilibrium. Diﬀerently, for the G¯ o model as shown in Fig. 3(b),
there are many intermediate states and the bimodal behavior is not so signiﬁcant as that in
Fig.3(a). Thus for the G¯ o model the folding is not of a two-state. T his is in agreement with
Chan and Kaya’s argument [5].
In experiments, a well-established criterion for two-state folding is that the van’t Hoﬀ
enthalpy ∆ HvHaround the transition midpoint is equal, or very close, to the calorime tric
enthalpy ∆ Hcalof the entire transition. In this work, we calculate the ratio ∆ HvH/∆Hcalas
suggested in Ref. [5] (here, the deﬁnition of ∆ HvH/∆Hcalis equal to ( k2)2in Ref. [5]), and
list the results in Table I. From Table I, we can clearly see the diﬀerenc e between the G¯ o
model and our G¯ o+ model. The G¯ o model, which is considered as a mod el with minimal
energetic frustrations, does not meet the calorimetric two-stat e criterion and gives out the
value of ∆ HvH/∆Hcalfar from 1. Nevertheless, our model satisﬁes the criterion quite w ell
(for real proteins, the value of ∆ HvH/∆Hcalis 0.96±0.03 [17]). This, again, implies the
two-state folding and the good cooperativity of our G¯ o+ model.
Physically, thehighcooperativityofourmodelmayresult fromthen arrowdistributionof
the denatured states and the high population of the native state a t the folding temperature
(see also Figs.2 and 3). In our model, the energy spectrum relating t o various conformations
is redistributed, comparing with that of the G¯ o model, due to the co llective eﬀect between
interactions. As a result, the energies of non-native conformatio ns are moved to higher
energy levels and a larger energy gap is left between the non-native conformations and the
native one (for the two models, the energies of the native state ar e the same). The large
5
energy gap makes the native state paticularly stable, which is believe d to be a necessary
condition for cooperative folding [18]. This may be the physical origin o f the two-state
cooperativity. It can be further explained from the viewpoint of th e free energy proﬁle. For
our G¯ o+ model, as shown in Fig.4, the free energy proﬁles have broa d activation barriers.
The broad activation barriers can account for the large movement of transition state caused
by mutation or temperature changes, and are considered as a com mon feature of the two-
state folding [19]. Our numerical results are surprisingly consistent with a phenomenological
speculation for the existence of such a free energy proﬁle in Ref. [1 9]. It should be noted that
the broad activation barriers are consistent with the narrow distr ibution of the denatured
states.
Now let us make a comparison of the foldability based on the plots of th e MFPT versus
PNfor both models. Note that we use PNinstead of the commonly used temperature T
in the horizontal axis in Fig.5. This is because that an identical conditio n should be taken
for the comparison. In lattice simulations, the temperature has an arbitrary unit and also
has no direct relationship with the real temperature. The comparis on between two diﬀerent
models at the same temperature may make no sense. Nevertheless , at an identical condition
with the same PN, the diﬀerences in the foldability can be well-deﬁned. This is similar to
other conditions used previously [20]. From Fig. 5, we can see that th e MFPT for our G¯ o+
model shows a slow decrease as PNincreases, it reaches a minimum at PN≈0.93, and then
it increases. For the G¯ o model, there is also a minimum but at PN≈0.71. It is clearly
that when the native state is stable (say, PN≥0.9), our G¯ o+ model folds signiﬁcantly fast,
i.e., the MFPT is smaller with one or two orders of magnitude than that o f the G¯ o model.
Physically, this can be explained as follows. From Eq.(1) we can easily se e that the energy
gain of forming a contact is usually smaller for our G¯ o+ model than th at for the G¯ o model.
At high temperatures, entropic contribution is dominant to the fre e energy barrier, and
the loss of entropy is always undercompensated by the energy gain , thus the G¯ o+ model
folds slower for its smaller energy gain. Whereas at low temperature s, folding is nearly a
downhill process, and the loss of entropy is always overcompensat ed by the energy gain.
6
Therefore, for the G¯ o+ model, it is easier to escape from kinetic tr aps, and the folding is
faster. Finally, we note that for the two models the pathways of re aching the transition state
from the denatured state are diﬀerent. Due to the high cooperat ivity in our G¯ o+ model, a
good core, the assembly of non-polar residues, is formed much ear lier at low temperatures
than that in the G¯ o model. Detailed kinetic results will be reported els ewhere. We also note
that similar results are obtained for diﬀerent chain sizes.
In conclusion, our G¯ o+ model, with many-body interactions depend ing on the local
structures included, exhibits a good two-state folding behavior. O ur results suggest that
the evolution of interactions during the folding plays an important ro le in the two-state
cooperativity in protein folding. We give a possible way how the interac tions evolve in
the folding, which may capture some essential features of the two -state folding. We expect
further study could provide new insights into the mechanism of prot ein folding.
