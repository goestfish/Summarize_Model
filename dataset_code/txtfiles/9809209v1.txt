An elusive issue in the extension of Eigen’s quasispecies model [1] of mo lecular
evolutiontoﬁnite populationsisthe characterizationoftheso-calle derrorthreshold
phenomenonwhichlimitsthelengthofthemoleculesand, consequent ly,the amount
of information they can store [2]. This phenomenon poses an interes ting challenge
to the theoriesof the origin oflife, since it preventsthe emergence of huge molecules
which could carry the necessary information for building a complex me tabolism.
Moreover, since modern theories of integration of information in pr e-biotic systems
involve the compartmentation of a small number of molecules, the un derstanding of
the eﬀects of the error propagation in ﬁnite populations has becom e a major issue
to the theories of the origin of life [3].
The quasispecies model was originally formulated within a deterministic chem-
ical kinetic framework based on a set of ordinary diﬀerential equat ions for the
concentrations of the diﬀerent types of molecules that compose t he population.
Such formulation, however, is valid only in the limit where the total num ber of
molecules, denoted by N, goes to inﬁnity. In the binary version of the quasispecies
model, a molecule is represented by a string of Ldigits (s1,s2,...,s L), with the
variables sαallowed to take on only two diﬀerent values, say sα= 0,1, each of
which representing a diﬀerent type of monomer used to build the mole cule. The
concentrations xiof molecules of type i= 1,2,...,2Levolve in time according to
the equations [1, 2]

and
Wij=AjqL−d(i,j)(1−q)d(i,j)i/negationslash=j, (4)
where 0≤q≤1 is the single-digit replication accuracy, which is assumed to be the
same for all digits.
The quasispecies concept and the error threshold phenomenon ar e illustrated
more neatly for the single-sharp-peak replication landscape, in whic h we ascribe
the replication rate a >1 to the so-called master string, say (1 ,1,...,1), and the
replication rate 1 to the remaining strings. In this context, the par ameterais
2
termed selective advantage of the master string. As the replicatio n accuracy q
decreases, two distinct regimes are observed in the population com position in the
deterministic case: the quasispecies regime characterized by the presence of the
master string together with its close neighbors, and the uniform regime where the
2Lstrings appear in the same proportion. The transition between the se regimes
takes place at the error threshold qc, whose value depends on the parameters Land
a[1,2]. However,eveninthedeterministiccase, N→ ∞, agenuinethermodynamic
order-disorder phase transition will occur in the limit L→ ∞only [4, 5, 6]. To
study this transition for large L, it is convenient to introduce the probability of
exact replication of an entire string, namely,
Q=qL, (5)
so that the discontinuous transition occurs at
Qc=1
a(6)
forL→ ∞[1, 6]. A recent ﬁnite-size scaling study of the sharpness of the thr eshold
transition indicates that the characteristics of the transition per sist across a range
ofQof order L−1aboutQc[7].
Although several theoretical frameworks have been proposed t o generalize the
deterministickineticformulationofthequasispeciesmodelsoastot akeintoaccount
theeﬀectofﬁnite N[8,9,10,11,12,13], thesomewhatuncontrolledapproximations
usedinthoseanalyseshavehinderedaprecisecharacterizationof theerrorthreshold
for ﬁnite populations. In particular, Nowak and Schuster [10] emplo yed a simple
birth and death model, whose deterministic limit, however, does not y ield the
stationary distribution predicted by Eq. (1), as well as numerical s imulations based
on Gillespie’s algorithm [14] to show that an appropriately deﬁned Qc(N) tends
to the deterministic value 1 /awithN−1/2for suﬃciently large populations. A
similar result was obtained by neglecting the possibility of occurrence of multiple
errors during the replication of a molecule [12]. A more drastic approx imation that
neglects linkage disequilibrium at the population level yields that Qc(N) increases
linearly with 1 /N[13]. Of course, since there is no generally accepted deﬁnition
of error threshold for ﬁnite N(and for ﬁnite Las well), denoted above by Qc(N),
there are some arbitrariness in those analyses.
In this paper we follow a more direct approach to characterize the e rror thresh-
old transition for ﬁnite N, which dispenses with a deﬁnition for Qc(N). As men-
tioned before, since a genuine phase transition occurs in the limits N→ ∞and
L→ ∞only, we study a stochastic (i.e. ﬁnite N) version of the quasispecies model
withL→ ∞andq→1 so that Q=qLis ﬁnite. In this limit the problem
simpliﬁes enormously as the probability of any string becoming a maste r string
due to replication errors is of order 1 /Land so can be safely neglected. Besides,
since for the single-sharp-peak replication landscape the strings c an be classiﬁed
in two types only: the master strings and the error tail, which compr ises all other
3
strings, the population at any given generation can be described by the single in-
tegern= 0,1,...,N, which gives the number of master strings in the population.
The goal then is to calculate the probability distribution that at gene rationtthere
are exactly nmaster strings in the population. This quantity, denoted by Pt(n),
obeys the recursion equation
Pt+1(n) =N/summationdisplay
m=0T(n,m)Pt(m) (7)

where

is the relative ﬁtness of the master strings. In writing Eq. (8) we ha ve followed
the prescription used in the implementation of the standard genetic algorithm [15]:
ﬁrst the natural selection process acting via diﬀerential reprodu ction is considered
and then the mutation process. We note that/summationtext
nT(n,m) = 1∀mandT(0,0) = 1.
Moreover the largest eigenvalue of Tisλ0= 1 and its corresponding eigenvector
isl†
0= (1,0,...,0). This stochastic model is easily recognized as the celebrated
Kimura-Crowinﬁniteallelemodel[16,17]whichhasbeenextensivelyst udiedwithin
the diﬀusion approximation for large N. However, for arbitrary values of Qanda
the solutions of the partial diﬀerential equations are too complicat ed to be of any
utility to our purposes [17].
As for ﬁnite Nthe ﬂuctuations, either in the reproduction or mutation pro-
cesses, will ultimately lead to the irreversible loss of all copies of the m aster string
from the population, the asymptotic solution of Eq. (7) is simply P∞(n) =δn0.
Our goal is to determine how the characteristic time, τ, that governs the vanishing
of the master strings from the population depends on N,Qanda.
Before proceeding on the analysis of the stochastic problem, it is ins tructive to
discuss brieﬂy the deterministic limit N→ ∞. In this case the average number of
master strings obeys the recursion equation
/angbracketleftn/angbracketrightt+1=N/summationdisplay
n=0N/summationdisplay
m=0nT(n,m)Pt(m)
=Qa/angbracketleftn/angbracketrightt, (10)
whose solution is /angbracketleftn/angbracketrightt= (Qa)t/angbracketleftn/angbracketright0. Hence, in the deterministic regime we ﬁnd
τ=−1
ln(Qa)(11)

which diverges at Q=Qc= 1/a, signalling thus the existence of a phase transition
in the limit N→ ∞. Clearly, for Q > Q cthe master strings are always present in
the population so that τis inﬁnite in this entire region.
We consider now the ﬁnite Nregime. In this case the recursion equations for
the moments of ndo not yield useful information since, as usual, the moment of
orderpdepends on the moment of order p+1 evaluated at the previous generation.
We resort then to a direct calculation of the probability distribution Pt(m). More
speciﬁcally, we will focus on the calculation of Pt(0), since this is the quantity that
measures the rate of vanishing of the master strings from the pop ulation. Although
Pt(0) could be evaluated through a series of matrix multiplications, a sim ple linear
algebra calculation yields [17]

one of ﬁnding the second largest eigenvalue of the nonsymmetric ma trixT. Since
the largest eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector are alrea dy known, this
numerical problem yields easily to the vector iteration method [18]. Alt ernatively,
we could ﬁnd τby following the time evolution of Pt(0), obtained directly through
the recursion equations (7), for a few generations and then plott ing ln[1−Pt(0)]
against the generation number t. We have veriﬁed that both methods yield the
same results for τ.
InFig.1wepresentthedependenceofln τontheprobabilityofexactreplication
of an entire string, Q, fora= 2 and several values of N. The ﬁnite Neﬀects are
negligible for values of Qsmaller than, though not too close, Qc, as indicated by
the very good agreement between the ﬁnite Ndata and the theoretical prediction
forN→ ∞given in Eq. (11). Since we expect τto increase exponentially with
increasing NforQ > Q c, and to tend towards its limiting value, Eq. (11), also
exponentially with NforQ < Q c, the issue is then to determine the dependence
ofτonNat the critical point Q=Qc. In Fig. 2 we present ln τcalculated at
Qc= 1/aagainst ln Nfor diﬀerent values of a. These results indicate clearly that
at the critical point τincreases like N1/2, irrespective of the value of a. Once
5
we have identiﬁed the rescaling of ln τthat leads to the collapsing of the data for
diﬀerent NatQ=Qc, the next step is to determine the sharpness of the transition,
namely, the range of QaboutQcwhere the transition characteristics persists. This
is achieved by assuming that the size of this region shrinks to zero like N−1/νas
N→ ∞, where the exponent ν≥0 is estimated using ﬁnite-size scaling or, more
precisely, the data collapsing method [19]. In Fig. 3 we show the collaps e of the
data for diﬀerent Nobtained with ν= 2 fora= 2, 10 and 50. Although for a= 2
we can achieve a good-quality data collapse using relatively small popu lation sizes
(N≥200), for larger values of a, however, a similar quality collapsing can only
be obtained using larger values of N(i.e.N≥400). In summary, the results of
the data collapsing method indicate that the dependence of τonNin the critical
region is very well described by the scaling assumption
τ=N1/2fa/bracketleftBig
(Q−Qc)N1/2/bracketrightBig

wherefais a scaling function, whose speciﬁc form depends on the parameter a.
To appreciate the eﬀect of the selective advantage parameter aon the quality
of the data collapsing results presented in Fig. 3, next we consider in some detail
the case a→ ∞andNﬁnite. Using wm→1 form >0 yields
T(n,m) =T(n) =/parenleftbigg

Qn(1−Q)N−nm >0. (16)
As before, T(0,0) = 1 and T(n,0) = 0 for n >0. In this case the eigenvalues of T
can easily be calculated analytically yielding λ0= 1,λ1=/summationtextN
n=1T(n),λ2=...=
λN= 0. Hence,
τ=−1

1−(1−Q)N/bracketrightBig. (17)
Finally, taking the limits Q→Qc= 0 and N→ ∞, we can easily verify that ν= 1
in this limit. This interesting result suggests that uncontrolled appro ximations
and simpliﬁcations of the original model which enhance the selective a dvantage
of the master string or the ﬁnite population sampling eﬀects are exp ected to give
unreliable estimates of the exponent ν. Moreover, care must be taken in restricting
the ﬁnite-size scaling analysis to the regime N≫ato avoid underestimating the
value of ν. We note, of course, that the situation of interest is N→ ∞whilea
remains ﬁnite.
To conclude, the collapse of the data for diﬀerent Nintoa-dependent scaling
functionspresentedinFig.3andsummarizedinthescalingassumptio n(15)provide
afullcharacterizationoftheerrorthresholdtransition,signalled inourmodelbythe
divergence of τatQc= 1/a, for large N. We emphasize that the main advantageof
our approachis that it does not relyupon any arbitrarydeﬁnition of errorthreshold
for ﬁnite populations.
