Abstract
For the ﬁrst time the phenomenon of cellular structure coars ening
are consistently analysed from the positions of kinetic, hy drodynamic and
stochastodynamic theories of nonequilibrium statistical systems. Thereby
micro-, meso- and macroscopic levels of approach are distin guished. At
the microscopic level the cellular structure is describe by a probability
distribution function in a phase space of cell coordinates a nd of cell sizes.
A kinetic equation for the function is written and a developm ent to a
hydrodynamic equation of a mesoscopic cell medium is realis ed. It has the
form of adiﬀusion-reaction equationwith anegative ”diﬀus ion” coeﬃcient
and with a cell interface density playing the role of concent ration. Its
analysis reveals a new eﬀect of macroscopic patterning in th e cell medium:
existence of space-correlated stochastic ﬂuctuations of t he cell interface
density.

1 Introduction
There are many physical systems consisting of homogeneous doma ins separated
by distinct boundaries, so called cellular structures: ordered doma ins in alloys,
magnetic domains, gas bubbles in soap froth and in lipid monolayers, gr ains in
polycrystals, etc. [1, 2, 3, 4]. We have here a simple physical situatio n (Fig. 1
[2]), when the system volume Vbeing the sum ofvolumes ofall cells, the volume
speciﬁc energy and the interface speciﬁc energy Eare constant. The internal
energy of the system Eis completely deﬁned by the cell interface area Σ. It is
easytoseethat foranytwoneighbouringcellsthevolumedecrease ofthesmaller
one (down to complete disappearance) and the simultaneous volume increase of
the greater one diminish Σ. This permanent topological possibility to d ecrease
E=EΣ makes the system intrinsically unstable. The mean cell size increase s
during this statistical process (Fig. 1), named ”coarsening”(larg e cells ”eat up”
small ones). The changes of Erelated to the elementary statistical event of cell
disappearance are so large in comparisonwith the energy of thermo ﬂuctuations,

that the coarsening cannot be described by ways of usual thermo dynamics [5].
Still this challenging statistical problem can be elegantly solved by met hods of
physical kinetics, as shown by Lifshitz, Slyozov and Hillert (LSH) [6, 7 , 8], if we
consider the cellular structure as some dynamic system. To get a ce ll dynamics
equation let us following LSH approximately consider each cell as an ela stic
sphere shell embedded in an elastic environment which represents t he average
eﬀect of cell-cell interaction. For a cell of radius awe write an interface tension
force asF=−E(1/a−κ), where the term 1 /ais related to the eﬀect of interface
surface tension of the cell itself and the term κ- to the eﬀect of interface surface
tension of adjoining cells (the elastic environment). The quantity κis nothing
that a self-consistent mean of cell curvature throughout the sy stem. Believing
that the cell interface velocity waﬀected by Fis determined by viscous law
w=MF, whereMis the cell interface mobility, we have [6, 7, 8]
da/dt=−D(1/a−κ) (1)
withD=ME. In the coarsening process the cells move in a size space {a}
(some phase space) with a velocity (1). We can write a continuity equ ation in
this space as
∂f/∂t+∂(fda/dt)/∂a= 0 (2)
for a cell size distribution function f(a,t) [6, 7, 8]. The function f(a,t) is
normalised so that n(t) =/integraltext

is the mean cell interface density. Here d= 2,3 is the cellular structure dimen-
sionality and Ω d= 2π(d−1)/d. Condition (3) is nothing that the conservation
law of the total volume of all cells in unit volume. A remarkable propert y of
this statistical dynamic system, discovered by LSH, is the occurre nce of astable
steady-state regime ofevolution. This regimeis observedif and only if the mean
curvatureκ(t)taketheunique”self-consistent”value κ(t) =/radicalbig
2/(Dt). Allother
macroscopicsystem variables obey also simple scaling laws :¯a(t)∝ρ−1(t)∝t1/2,
n(t)∝td/2and the solution of (1)-(3) has a universal scaling form
f0(a,t)∝(1/¯a(t))d+1ϕ(µ1a/¯a(t)), (4)
whereϕ(z) is a peaked function, depending on donly, andµ1≈1 [6, 7, 8].

There is a great number of publications devoted to the question of ” improve-
ment” of the individual cell dynamics equation (1) (we will say microsc opic dy-
namics equation) to get a good agreement of the cell size distributio nf0(a,t)
with experimental data, essentially in the metallurgic literature relat ed to nor-
mal grain growth [2, 3, 4, 9, 10]. Surprisingly small attention has bee n paid to
mesoscopic and macroscopic behaviours of the cellular structures as some con-
tinuous elastic cellular medium with viscous motion law, although the exis tence
of interesting self-organisation eﬀects is almost evident here [11, 1 2]. Indeed, if
we have a good look at Fig. 1 we can see a strong size correlation of ad jacent
cells. Near a small cell the probability to ﬁnd another small cell is grat er then a
large one, and vice versa, near a large cell the probability to ﬁnd ano ther large
cell is grater then a small one. In other words we observe here spa ce-correlated
ﬂuctuations of the mesoscopic cell interface density ρ(x,t). Qualitatively this
eﬀect can be easy analysed. Let us consider a nonhomogeneous ce llular struc-
ture with the macroscopic mean interface density ρ(t) and the mesoscopic one
ρ(x,t) =ρ(t)+δρ(x,t) , weakly varying in space. To be more precise, let us as-
sume thatδρ(x,t)<<ρ(t) and the wavelength λof spatial variations of ρ(x,t)
is much greaterthan ¯ a≈1/ρ(t). Let us cut out a medium volume VLhaving the
sizeL<<λ, but still including many cells. Each element d sof the surface Σ L,
enclosingVL, is aﬀected by the interface tension of the cells, surrounding VL.
The total interface tension force acting on VLis/contintegraltext
Eρds=/integraltext
E∇ρdV. In a ho-
mogeneous cell medium this force equals zero. In the nonhomogene ous medium
the force is non zero. The total cell interface in VL, which moves as the whole
under the force eﬀect, is/integraltext
ρdV. Hence the force acting on cell interface unit is
E∇ρ/ρ. Supposing the viscous law for the cell interface movement, we ﬁnd a
cell interface ﬂux j=ρv∝D∇ρ. We see that the cells make a collective motion
in the direction ∇ρ. This is an uphill diﬀusion” of the cell medium. Taking into
account the annihilation law d ρ/t∝ −Dρ3, which follows from ρ(t)∝t−1/2, we
get [12]
∂ρ/∂t=−γ1Dρ3−γ2D△ρ. (5)
Hereγ1andγ2are dimensionless constants, depending on the scaling distri-
bution function ϕ(z), only. Equation (5) has the form of a diﬀusion-reaction
equation with the cell interface density ρplaying the role of concentration and
with a negative ”diﬀusion” coeﬃcient. We see that, the amplitude of a ny small
spatial ﬂuctuation δρ(x,t) with wavelength λ<ξ, whereξ= 2π/radicalbig
γ2/3γ1ρ−1is
the correlation length of the ﬂuctuations, grows without bound. I t follows that
competing stochastic processes of cell disappearance and cell me dium ”uphill
diﬀusion” can give rise to the formation of large-scale domains of the sizeλ≤ξ
having the density ρ(x,t) greater or smaller than the mean value ρ(t) (Fig. 2
[13]). It also means that space derivatives of higher order of ρmust be taken
into account in right side of (5) for detailed analysis of the system st ability and
more accurate estimation of ξ.
Whereas the physical ideas explaining the possible macroscopic self- organi-
sation eﬀects are simple, the consecutive derivation of the mesosc opic evolution
equation (5) and the calculation of kinetic coeﬃcients γ1andγ2, deﬁning the
eﬀect quantitatively, turns out to be a diﬃcult statistical task [14]. Therefore
the ”technique” of the problem solution asks for some commentarie s. Let us
consider an ideal gas as a well-known example for comparison. The co nsistent
description of its evolution include three classic scale levels of conside ration:

micro-, meso- and macroscopic [5, 6, 15, 16]. On the microscopic level the evo-
lution is eﬀectively described by methods of physical kinetics, i.e. by B oltzmann
kinetic equation [5, 6] for the system probability distribution function fin a
phase space, taking into account interaction and movement laws of atoms. Hav-
ing the equilibrium solution f0for the homogeneous gas (Maxwell-Boltzmann
(MB) distribution), it is possible to move to the mesoscopic level of the system
description by introducing mesoscopicquantities (density, pressu re, etc.) as mo-
ments of the distribution function. In the case of small spatial gra dients of the
mesoscopic quantities, integration of kinetic equation by Enskog me thod gives a
hydrodynamic equation [6, 15]. If the hydrodynamic equation has steady-state
nonhomogeneoussolutions, it is possibleto talk abouta macroscopic description
of the system by means of spatial patterns of size ξmuch greater than the meso-
scopic size. To study the patterns formation it is convenient to tra nsform the
hydrodynamic equation into Langevin stochastic equation [16] for an order pa-
rameter. As we see above LSH distribution (4) plays the same outstanding ro le
for the coarsening cellular structures in steady-state, as MB dist ribution plays
for ideal gases in equilibrium state [5, 6, 7, 8]. All diﬀerence between M B and
LSH distributions is that the ﬁrst is determined by thermoﬂuctuatio ns related
to collisions of gas atoms and the second is determined by stochasto ﬂuctuations
related to the process of cells annihilation. Hence the main methodica l idea of
this paper is to use LSH distribution as a basis for the multilevel descr iption of
cellular structure, like MB distribution is used in order to go from the k inetic
equation to the hydrodynamic one and then to the stochastic one. This idea
has interesting applications for other physical systems, where th e scaling regime
is reached. For example, its application allows to generalise Lifshitz-S lyozov
theory of homogeneous coalescence [7] for the nonhomogeneous case [17], to de-
scribe the relaxation of nonhomogeneous dislocation structure du ring annealing
[12] etc.

2 Kinetic theory (microscopic level)
Let us consider as in Sec. 1 a nonhomogeneous cellular structure wit h the in-
terface density ρ(x,t), weakly varying in space. We divide the volume Vof the
system into small coarse-graining elements VLwithL << λ, but still includ-
ing many cells. In the ﬁrst approximation the cell dynamics of the str ucture
in eachVLwill be deﬁned by the dynamics equation (1), with the curvature κ
becoming a local caracteristic - an interface curvature self-consistent mean ﬁeld
κ(x,t) . The ﬁeld κ(x,t) inVLat point xequals to the self-consistent mean
of cell curvature κ(t) determined by (1)-(4) for the cell structure in VLif we
approximately consider it as homogeneous. The ﬁeld κ(x,t) is a weakly varying
function in space as ρ(x,t) is. In the second approximation the dynamics equa-
tion (1) will contain gradients of the ﬁeld κ(x,t). It is easy to establish this fact
if weanalyzean one-dimensionalcellularstructure( d= 1). Let us cell interfaces
are located at the points xi(i= 0,±1,±2,...) ofx-axe. We have the cell radii
a(i)= (xi+1−xi)/2 , the cell curvatures κ(i)= 1/a(i)and the cell centres coordi-
natesx(i)= (xi+1+xi)/2. Eachinterfaceisacted uponby attractionofadjacent
ones(the interfacetension ofthe cells) accordingtothe law Fi=E(κ(i)−κ(i−1))
with the result that the cell changes its position dx(i)/dt=D(κ(i+1)−κ(i−1))/2
and its size da(i)/dt=D(κ(i+1)+κ(i−1)−2κ(i))/2. If we now introduce a cur-
vature exact ﬁeld κe(x,t) as a step function, which is κ(i)ifxi<x<x i+1, we
can rewrite dx(i)/dt=D[κe(x(i)−a(i),t)−κe(x(i)+a(i),t)]/2 andda(i)/dt=
D[κe(x(i)+a(i),t)+κe(x(i)−a(i),t)−2/a(i)]/2. Replacing the exact ﬁeld κe(x,t)
by the mean ﬁeld κ(x,t) and taking into account that ¯ a << L << λ we get
respectively the cell velocity and the cell size change rate
dx/dt=Da∇κ/d, (6)
da/dt=−D(1/a−κ)+Da2△κ/(2d). (7)
It is easy to understand that the abovementioned deﬁnition of the curvature
mean ﬁeldκe(x,t) holds for nonhomogeneous cellular structures in two ( d= 2)
and three dimensions ( d= 3). Expressions (6) and (7) are also valid. Really,
each cell of the structure may be approximatelythought of as hav ingthe form of
sphere. Then the all cellular structure conﬁguration may be descr ibed through
the cell centrecoordinatesand the cell radii. Letus chooseacell o fradiusawith
centre in a point xand an interface point with coordinate x′=x+a(x′,t) of the
cell. The velocity w(x′,t) of the interface point aﬀected by the interface tension
forceF(x′,t) =−E[1/a(t)−κe(x′,t)]a(x′,t)/a(t), is determined by the viscous
laww(x′,t) =MF(x′,t)]. Replacing κe(x,t) byκ(x,t) we can approximately
calculate the cell velocity d x/dt=/contintegraltext
w(x′,t)ds′/(Ωddad−1)≈a∇w/dand the
cell size change rate d a/dt=/contintegraltext
w(x′,t)ds′/(Ωddad−1)≈w+a2△w/(2d) and
ﬁnd expresions (6) and (7).
We see that the cells move in a coordinate-size space {x,a}in the process
of coarsening. These movements are conveniently described by kin etic equation
[18]
∂f/∂t+∂(fdx/dt)/∂x+∂(fda/dt)/∂a= 0 (8)

nate-size space with normalisation condition

Equations (8) and (9) have the physical sense of continuity equat ion in the
coordinate-size space and of conservation law of the total volume of all cells of
the system. They are natural generalisations of (2) and (3). For the macroscop-
ically homogeneous cell structure the set of equations (6)-(9) co mes to (1)-(3)
and has the solution (4) with ϕ(z) = [dz/(2−z)d+2](2e)dexp[2d/(z−2)] for
0< z <2 andϕ(z) = 0 forz≥2 ;µi=/integraltext

variables obey simple scaling laws: ¯ a(t) =µ1√

Dt;
n(t) = 1/(Ωdµd(√
Dt)d) andρ(t) =dµd−1/(2µd√
Dt).
To ﬁndf1(x,a,t) =f0(a,t)+δf(x,a,t) in the ﬁrst-order approximation for
small parameters | ∇ρ|/ρ2<<1, it is necessary, as in well-known Enskog
method [6], to substitute f1(x,a,t) in (6)-(9) and linearize them, taking into
account that δf(x,a,t)<< f0(a,t). I hope in a future work to realise this
possibility, but this is proving at present to be a diﬃcult task [14].
3 Hydrodynamic theory (mesoscopic level)
Equation (8) provides the kinetic (microscopic) description of the c ellular struc-
ture coarsening. To get the hydrodynamic equation let us rewrite ( 4) as
f0(a,t) =αρd+1ϕ(βaρ), (10)
whereα= (µd)d/[Ωd(dµd−1)d+1] andβ=µd/(dµd−1) are constants, and use
again as in Sec. 1 and 2 the standard coarse-grain averaging proce dure [1].
Namely, let us introduce a mesoscopic coarse-graining length L(t)>>¯a(t),
so that a mesoscopic coarse-graining volume VL= ΩdLdincludes many cells.
Let us divide the volume Vof cellular structure into elements of volume VL.
For small gradients of mesoscopic variables κ(x,t),¯a(x,t),ρ(x,t),andn(x,t) we
may suppose that a local homogeneous steady-state is reached in each separate
elementVLafter a time τL=L2/Dmuch greater than the cell annihilation time
τa= ¯a2/D. For all this, the cellular structure as the whole (macroscopically)
is not in the homogeneous state. Then the distribution function f0(x,a,t) in
VLat point xcan be assumed to be a local steady-state function , equal to LSH
distribution (10) for the homogeneous cellular structure with dens ityρ(x,t),
that prevails at the point x. This supposition is completely analogous to the
local system equilibrium one inlinear thermodynamics [5, 6]. Multiplying (8) by
Ωddad−1/2, (6) by Ω ddad−1f0/2, (8) by Ω dad, integrating them by aand using
conservation law (9), we make the averaging procedure. After su ﬃciently heavy
calculations we obtain, respectively, the equation of cell medium continuity , an
analogue of Darcy’s law in hydrodynamics and an equation similar to the state
equation in gas dynamics [15]:
∂ρ/∂t+∇(ρv) =−D[α1ρ3−α2ρ2κ−α3△κ], (11)
v= (D/2)ρ−1∇κ, (12)
ρ3κ=β1ρ4−β2ρ△κ+β3∇κ∇ρ. (13)
The set of three hydrodynamic equations (11)-(13), containing t hree hydrody-
namic quantities of the cell medium: the density ρ(x,t) , the velocity v(x,t) =
(Ωdd/ρ)/integraltext
0ad−1(dx/dt)fda, and the curvature κ(x,t), forms a closed set. The
role of the quantities ρ(x,t) ,κ(x,t) andv(x,t) are completely analogous to the
6
role of gas density, pressure and velocity in viscous gas dynamics. I f initial and
boundary conditions are known, the cell medium movement can be de termined
by traditional hydro-gas dynamics methods [15] for any continuou s distribution
ofρ(x,t) ,κ(x,t) andv(x,t). By substituting (12)-(13) in (11), the set can be
reduced to evolution equation (5). In (5), (11)-(13) α1,α2,β1,β2,γ1,γ2are cal-
culated constants. For d= 2:α1= 1.54,α2= 1.11,α3= 0.25, β1= 1.11,β2=
0,β3= 0.267,γ1= 0.308,γ2= 0.277. Ford= 3:α1= 1.16,α2= 1.44,α3= 0.5,
β1= 0.718,β2= 0.132,β3= 0.263,γ1= 0.129,γ2= 0.136. Full expressions are
suﬃciently bulky (e.g. α1= 4(d−1)µ2
dµd−3/(d2µ3
d−1)) and will be published
elsewhere [14].
4 Stochastodynamic theory (macroscopic level)
To analyse the dynamics of macroscopic spatial perturbations of t he cell me-
dium, let us introduce a relative value of deviation of the cell interfac e density
from its mean macroscopic value ψ(x,t) =δρ(x,t)/ρ(t)<<1 , whereρ(t) is
the uniform solution of (5). Substituting ρ(x,t) =ρ(t) +δρ(x,t) in (5) and
coming to new time and space variables ∂˜t= 3γ1Dρ2(t)∂t=−∂lnρ3(t) and
∂˜x=ρ(t)∂x(intrinsic system variables [7]), we obtain
∂ψ/∂˜t=−δF/δψ (14)
withF{ψ}=/integraltext
d˜x[Aψ2+C(˜∇ψ)2]/2 ,A= 1 and C=−γ2/(3γ1) (C=−0.300
ford= 2 and C=−0.351 ford= 3 ). Taking ψ(˜x,˜t) in the form ψ(˜x,˜t) =
ψ(˜k,˜ω)ei(˜k˜x−˜t˜ω), we get the dispersion relation ˜ ω(˜k) =−i˜σ(˜k) , where
˜σ(˜k) =A+C˜k2(15)
isthedampingcoeﬃcient. Includingin F{ψ}the term −hψdescribingtheeﬀect
of an external ﬁeld h(˜x,˜t)∝ei(˜k˜x−˜t˜ω), we ﬁnd the generalised susceptibility
˜χ(˜k,˜ω) = 1/[˜σ(˜k)−i˜ω].
As all mesoscopic quantities, ψis a ﬂuctuating quantity. But on writing
(14) we have neglected these ﬂuctuations. The quantity ψis a sum of a number
of microscopic random quantities. Each of them corresponds to th e contri-
bution of a cell being in VL. In view of central limit theorem of statistics,
ψhas Gaussian distribution function with the mean value < ψ > L= 0 and
the dispersion < ψ2>L=ν/[VLN] , whereν=µ2(d−1)/µ2
d−1−1 (ν= 0.109
ford= 2 andν= 0.373 ford= 3) [14]. Equation (14), after taking into
account the ﬂuctuations, becomes Langevin stochastic equation withF{ψ}
being astochastodynamic potential [19]. The noise ζis Gaussian noise, with
<ζ >= 0 and the correlation function <ζ(˜x,˜t)ζ(˜x′,˜t′)>= 2θδ(˜x−˜x′)δ(˜t−˜t′)
, deﬁned by the ﬂuctuations at scales a << L andτa<< τL. Hereθ=
Ωd(d/2)d−1(µd
d−1/µd−1
d)(µ2(d−1)/µ2
d−1−1) (θ= 0.619ford= 2 andθ= 8.09 for
d= 3 ) [14]. The forms of evolution equation (14) and of the noise ζguarantee
that the steady-state probability distribution functional is given b y Boltzmann
formulaP{ψ} ∝exp[−F{ψ}/θ] [19]. We see that our cell system is rated in
the class of so-called potential systems with potential F{ψ}having Landau-
Ginzburg form [5, 6, 16] and the quantity ψplays a role of an order parameter .
It is not surprizing because in general sense the system is in perfec t analogy to
a thermodynamic system with a nonconserved order parameter ψ. So the forms
7
of evolution equation (14) and of potential F{ψ}are dictated by simple symme-
try macroscopic considerations. Instead of the thermal noise in t hermodynamic
systems we have here the stochastic noise, created by the contin uous process of
cells annihilation. In virtue of reasoning, ﬂuctuation-dissipation the orem may
be applied, according to which the generalised susceptibility ˜ χ(˜k,˜ω) determines
the spectral correlation function of ﬂuctuations as ˜S(˜k,˜ω) = (2θ/˜ω)Im˜χ(˜k,˜ω) .
The structure function has usual Ornstein-Zernike form ˜S(˜k) =θ/˜σ(˜k) [5, 6].
From (15) we see, that the order parameter modes ψ(˜k,˜t) with˜k>/radicalbig
−A/C
are unstable. This is every indication that highest order terms of th e expan-
sion ofF{ψ}in powers of ˜∇ψmust be considered for detailed analysis of the
system stability. The derivation of the exact expression for these terms by
Enskog method is a very heavy task [6, 14] not realized to the prese nt. We
proceed now diﬀerently. Let us use the fact that our system is pot ential with
the nonconserved order parameter ψ. Then we may consider F{ψ}as some
phenomenological potential in the abovemensioned Landau sense. This poten-
tial have necessarily the general form F{ψ}=/integraltext
dx[Aψ2+C(˜∇ψ)2+D(˜△ψ)2]/2
withD>0 [5, 16, 20]. The phenomenological coeﬃcients A,CandDcan be
found from experiments, computer simulations or by a direct calcula tion as we
have made above for AandC. As a consequence we get the damping coeﬃcient
in the form
˜σ(˜k) =A+C˜k2+D˜k4. (16)
We do not know the real value of D, but we are able to forecast the possible
scenarios of system evolution [20]. If A>0,C<0 andD>C2/(4A) the
evolution equation (14) has the single stable solution ψ0(˜x) = 0 , and modes
ψ(˜k,˜t) with any ˜kdecay with time. Therefore the system is stable with respect
to large-scale ﬂuctuations of ψ(˜x,˜t) nearψ0(˜x) = 0 . The modes ψ(˜k,˜t) with
˜k=˜kC=/radicalbig
−C/(2D) = 2π/˜ξ, where˜ξis an intrinsic correlation length, have
the lowest decay rate. That is why under the action of the stochas tic internal
noiseζ, created by a continuous process of cells annihilation, space-corr elated
ﬂuctuations arise in the system. The system is in a modulated state (short range
ordering) and the structure function
˜S(˜k) =θ/(A+C˜k2+D˜k4). (17)
has a maximum at ˜k=˜kC(Fig. 3), reﬂecting the abovestated fact that the
modesψ(˜kC,˜t)decaywiththelowestrate. If A>0,C<0and0<D<C2/(4A)
, the evolution equation (14) has the unstable solution ψ0(˜x) = 0 and stationary
one-, two-, ... d-dimensional space-periodical solutions with wavelength ˜λ=˜ξ
[20]. Under the action of the stochastic internal noise ζthe system comes from
the homogeneous state into one of these patterned state (long range ordering).
The question of existence of the ﬁrst or of the second type of ord ering depends
of the value of coeﬃcient D.
5 Discussion
We see that in the process of structure coarsening the macrosco pic cell interface
densityρ(t) decreases with time as ρ(t)∝t−1/2and the mesoscopic density
ρ(x,t) =ρ(t)[1+δρ(x,t)/ρ(t)] also decreases (Fig. 1). The competition of two

mean size ¯a(x,t) greater or smaller than the macroscopic mean value ¯ a(t) . The
amplitude of relative ﬂuctuations δρ(x,t)/ρ(t) and the domain size (characteris-
tic wavelength of ﬂuctuations), divided by the mean cell size ξ/¯a(t)∝ξρ(t) =˜ξ
stay constant. These domains can be short-range ordered (Fig. 1) or long-range
(Fig. 2) ordered in space. The short-range ordering of cell interf ace density
ﬂuctuations resemble the ﬂuid density ﬂuctuations ordering in the w ell-known
phenomenon of critical opalescence. The long-range ordering of c ell interface
density ﬂuctuations resemble to the eﬀect of spinodal decomposit ion in thermo-
dynamic systems.
This is just a moment to return to the question discussed in Sec. 1 an d
2 about basing of the self-consistent mean ﬁeld approximation for d escription
of the cellular systems. The condition of its validity is the condition tha t the
relativevalueofﬁeldﬂuctuations δκ(x,t)/κ(t)≈δρ(x,t)/ρ(t)≈ψ(x,t) issmall.
More priscisely, the ﬂuctuations averaged over the coarse-grain ing volume VL
must be small: < ψ2(x,t)>L=ν/[VLN(x,t)]<<1 . Choosing the volume
of a ﬁrst coordination sphere as a minimum possible value of VLand taking
into consideration that n=VLNis the number of cells in VL, we see that
this condition is well satisﬁed both for d= 2(ν= 0.109,n≈7) andd=
3(ν= 0.373,n≈13). The general condition of validity of mean-ﬁeld theory
for the systems with Landau-Ginzburg potential F{ψ}is well-known Ginzburg
criterion: ﬂuctuations of ψaveraged over the correlation volume must be small
< ψ2(x,t)>ξ=ν/[VξN(x,t)]<<1 . This criterion is obviously fulﬁlled if
L≤ξ. Uniting this condition with the foregoing condition of existence of
stochastodynamic potential F{ψ}, we have ﬁnally ¯ a << L ≤ξ. This is just
the familiar condition of the choice of the coarse graining size L, which is also
9
the condition of validity of the self-consistent mean ﬁeld approximat ionin phase
transformation theory. It can be satisﬁed if ¯ a<<L≤ξ. In coarsening cellular
systems this is always the case for the short range ordering ( D>C2/(4A))
and this is so indeed if D>>−C/(8π2) for the long-range ordering (0 <D<
C2/(4A) ).
In spite of that the ordering eﬀects of cell interface density ﬂuct uations
can be evidently established by visual analysis of diﬀerent cellular str uctures
in experiments (Fig. 1) and computer simulations (Fig. 2), I am not aw are
of publications, where the structure function (17), describing th e eﬀect quan-
titatively, has been directly obtained. I feel that it is related to two reasons.
Firstly, it must be noted that hydrodynamic and stochastodynamic theories de-
veloped here are valid in the long wavelength limit ˜k=kρ(t)<1 , when we can
guarantee the possibility of application of the cell medium conception and the
self-consistent mean ﬁeld approximation. In the long wavelength limit ˜k<1 the
maximum of ˜S(˜k) is hardly observed: if ˜kC<<1 the maximum is small (Fig.
3); if˜kC≈1 it is hardly separated from the other maximum ˜k0≈2 correspond-
ing to the trivial eﬀect that the mean distance between neighbourin g interfaces
is 2¯a. This later maximum cannot be described within our long wavelength
approach and is not shown in Fig. 3. Therefore the more strong con ﬁrmation
of existence of the large-scale ﬂuctuations of cell interface dens ity is the obser-
vation of the negative curvature of˜S(˜k) in the macroscopic ˜k→0 limit (Fig.
3). However it demands of a laborious statistical analysis or a scatt ering study
of very large cellular systems. In actual practice the ﬁnite-size ind uced eﬀects
stays too essential [21]. Secondly, in computer experiments, using usually ”
q- states Potts model” [10, 13], the structure function S(k) is calculated as a
Fourier transform of the correlation function of a phases volume d ensity. If all
phases have the same equilibrium energy, and the boundaries separ ating the
phase domains, are suﬃciently distinct, the system state is complet ely deﬁned
by the total interfacial area. In consequence, the cell interfac e densityρ(x,t)
and the corresponding structure function (17) is a much more sen sible charac-
teristic of the system than the phases volume density and the corr esponding to
it structure function. Quite recently [22] it has been demonstrate d by computer
simulation of normal grain growth that a size correlation between ne ighbouring
grains exist in grain structure. Unfortunately the spectral corr elation analy-
sis of the cell interface density ﬂuctuations by means of the struc ture function
(17) has not been made and direct quantitative comparison of thes e results with
present theoryresults is diﬃcult. Still there is no doubt that we are dealing with
the ﬁrst observation of the short-range ordering of cell interfa ce density ﬂuctu-
ations in cellular structures. New experiments or computer simulatio ns with
careful space spectral analysis of cell interface density ﬂuctua tions are needed
to conﬁrm the existence of dynamic patterning in cellular structure s.
6 Summary
In summary, the problems of multilevel description of cellular struct ure evolu-
tion are considered from positions of kinetic, hydrodynamic and sto chastody-
namic theories of nonequilibrium statistical systems. It is demonstr ated that
the eﬀective method to solve the problem is to describe the cellular st ructure on
the microscopic level by the probability distribution function in the co ordinate-
10
size space, i.e. in the space of the cell coordinates and the cell sizes . The
kinetic equation for the weakly nonhomogeneous cellular structure is written
and the development to hydrodynamic equations for a continuous e lastic cellu-
lar medium with viscous motion law is realised. These non-linear diﬀerent ial
equations contain three mesoscopic quantities of the cell medium (t he cell inter-
face density, the cell medium velocity and the cell interface curvat ure) and are
analogous to the continuity equation, Darcy’s law and the equation o f state in
gas dynamics. For continuous ﬂow of the cell medium the hydrodyna mic equa-
tion set is reduced to a single evolution equation for the cell interfac e density.
It has the form of a diﬀusion-reaction equation with a negative ”diﬀu sion” co-
eﬃcient and with the cell interface density playing the role of ”conce ntration”.
It is shown that the relative value of deviation of the cell interface d ensity from
its mean macroscopic value is a suitable order parameter of the syst em. The
order parameter dynamics are described by Langevin stochastic e quation with a
stochastodynamic potential having Ginzburg-Landau form and wit h a stochas-
tic noise, created by the continuous process of cells annihilation. An alysis of
the order parameter dynamics in coarsening reveals a new eﬀect of macroscopic
patterning in the cell medium: competition between two stochastic p rocesses of
the small cells ”eating up” by large ones and of the ”uphill cells diﬀusion ” leads
to the creation of space-correlated ﬂuctuations of the cell inter face density.
