Summary. —
Using the Gaussian Ansatzfor the monomer–monomer correlation functions we de-
rive a set of the self–consistent equations for determinati on of the conformational
state in the bead–and–spring copolymer model. The latter is based on the Edwards
type eﬀective free energy functional with arbitrary two–bo dy interaction matrix.
The rate of conformational changes in kinetics may be expres sed via the instanta-
neous gradients of the variational free energy functional i n the space of the averaged
dynamical variables. We study the equilibrium and kinetics for some periodic and
random aperiodic amphiphilic sequences in inﬁnitely dilut ed solution. Typical equi-
librium phase diagrams are elucidated and the conformation al structure of diﬀerent
states is discussed. The kinetics of compaction of an amphip hilic copolymer to
the globular state proceeds through formation of locally fr ustrated non–equilibrium
structures. This leads to a rather complicated multistep ki netic process. We ob-
serve that even a small modiﬁcation in the primary sequence o f a copolymer may
signiﬁcantly change its kinetic folding properties.

1. – Introduction
Conformational transitions of heteropolymers in dilute solutions at tract special at-
tention of theorists in recent years [1]. There is a signiﬁcant body of works carried out on
concentrated solutions, mixtures and blends of copolymersbased on the density variables
formulation [2]. The inﬁnite dilution limit, for which such approaches can not be used,
is nevertheless very important for understanding the fundament al interactions of macro-
molecules not beset with the complications due to the aggregation ph enomena. Apart
from a purely academic interest, the single chain problem appears to be of paramount

importance for building up increasingly sophisticated models of biopolymers — the goal
that seemed too remote only a decade ago. The progress in the mod ern biotechnology
is often impeded by the inability to solve a few fundamental theoretic al problems among
which there is one grand challenge — given the primary sequence of ma cromolecule
ﬁnd its conformational structure at a given equilibrium, steady, or more interestingly,
nonequilibrium state. The next part of the puzzle would be to ﬁnd the relation between
the conformational structure and biofunctionality of say a prote in, but this sometimes
can be explained by location of certain active sites on the surface of a protein globule.
The computational diﬃculties are clearly immense for even not so long protein
chain of just about 60 amino acid residues. Therefore at the momen t one hopes to
develop merely some oversimpliﬁed models of heteropolymers abstra cting from the ac-
curate molecular level description. Such models are obtained by coa rse–graining in a
fashion normal for statistical mechanics by integrating out many o f the local degrees
of freedom. We hope to be able to deduce the mesostructure of a m acromolecule and
to obtain many of the important observables. The approach that w e employ here is
in its essence a nonequilibrium extension of the Gibbs–Bogoliubov varia tional principle.
The main strength of the Gaussian self–consistent (GSC) method, which we [3, 4, 5]
and others [6] were developing ﬁrst for the simple homopolymer and in Ref. [7] we have
brought to the most general form capable of describing copolymer s, is in that it produces
the complete set of mean squared distances between pairs of mono mers and thus the
conformational structure.
In this work we do not concentrate on the formal derivation of the GSC equations.
This ispresentedin somedetailinRef. [7]. First, weshallintroduceac ruciallyimportant
modiﬁcationtothemodelitselfbyaddinganewso–calledself–interac tionterm. Weprove
that without this regularising term the theory is plagued with diverge nces if at least one
second virial coeﬃcient is negative. We show that although the new t erm is seemingly
negligible for long chain lengths, and indeed is not required for the coil, it does in fact
the trick of correcting the structure of the dense globular state . In the rest of the work
we carry out extensive study of the equilibrium properties and the f olding kinetics for
a number of examples of heteropolymer sequences. We also discuss how the spin glass
behaviour arises for suﬃciently random copolymer sequences.
2. – The Model and the GSC Equations
The main variables in the coarse–grained description of the polymer c hain [8, 9, 10]
are the spatial monomer coordinates Xn, wherenis the monomer number. The solvent
molecules are excluded from the considerationby integratingout th eir degreesof freedom
from the path integral representation for the partition function . The resulting monomer
interactions are represented by the eﬀective free energy funct ional (EFEF),

where for heteropolymers u(J)
{n}are in principle allowed to have any dependence on the
site indices {n} ≡ {n1,...,n J}. The ﬁrst term in Eq. (1) describes the connectivity of
the chain with lcalled the statistical segment length. There are also volume interac tions
represented by the virial–type expansion [9, 10] in Eq. (1). They re ﬂect the hard–core
repulsion, the weak attraction between monomers and the eﬀectiv e interaction mediated
by the solvent–monomer couplings.
SELF–CONSISTENT TREATMENT OF COPOLYMERS WITH ARBITRARY SE QUENCES 3
Here we consider the following choice of site–dependent second viria l coeﬃcients in
Eq. (1),
u(2)
nn′= ¯u(2)+∆σn+σn′
2, (2)
andu(J)
{n}=u(J)forJ >2. This corresponds to the case of amphiphilic heteropolymers,
for which monomers diﬀer only in the monomer–solvent coupling const ants. The mean
second virial coeﬃcient , ¯u(2), is associated with the quality of the solvent and the pa-
rameter ∆ is called the degree of amphiphilicity of the chain. The set {σn}expresses
the chemical composition, or the primary sequence of a heteropolymer. Here we consider
the case when variables σncan take only three values: −1,1 and 0 corresponding to
hydrophobic ’ a’, hydrophilic ’ b’ and “neutral” ’ c’ monomers respectively.
It is assumed that the long timescale evolution of the conformationa l state is well
represented by the Langevin equation, which upon neglecting the h ydrodynamics may
be written as,
ζbd
dtXn=−∂H
∂Xn+ηn(t), (3)

where the Greek indices denote the spatial components of 3-d vec tors.
The main idea of the Gaussian self–consistent method is to choose th e trial Hamil-

This corresponds to the Gaussian distribution of the inter–monome r distances, ( Xm−

ability density to ﬁnd the monomer m′at the distance rfrom the monomer m, will be
given by,

3. – The Self–interaction Energy Term
The appearance of the last term in Eq. (11), Esi, is somewhat more nontrivial. In
fact, in the EFEF of the model (1) we have discarded terms with two or more coinciding
indices in the three– and higher body contributions. These terms co me formally from the
virial–type expansion, but each of them gives a singular contribution to the mean energy
(11). It turns out, however, that upon suppressing these term s there appear additional
pathological solutions of the GSC equations with singular free energ y if at least one
element of the two–body interaction matrix, u(2)
mm′, becomes negative. This is easy to
see. Indeed, consider volume interactions of just three monomer s under condition that
the mean squared distances from monomers ’0’ and ’1’ to ’2’ are equ al to each other,
D0,2=D1,2=D. These interactions produce the mean energy contribution,

D0,1/4+(6u(3)(2π)−3/2/|u(2)
0,1|)2/3, obviously in the limit D0,1→0 the energy possesses
a singular minimum, E3→ −∞. As for the free energy, the logarithmic divergence of the
entropy could not change the situation, thus A → −∞ as well. One can show that the
inclusion of more monomers in the chain or of higher than three–body interactions does
not improve the situation, but produces more and more of such pat hological solutions.
The reason we have not discussed this problem in our previous consid erations is that we
have accounted for the additional symmetry properties of monom er–monomer distances,
which come from the symmetry of the EFEF (1). For example, in the c ase of the ring
homopolymer, due to the inverse symmetry [5], we assumed that for any indices m,
m′the following mean squared distances are equal, Dm,m′=Dm,2m−m′=D2m′−m,m′.
This provides suﬃcient repulsion coming from three–body term to pr eclude pathological
solutions.
Thus, in a more generalcase, where no symmetry propertiescould be assumed for an
arbitrary sequence, the standard procedure of suppressing te rms with coinciding indices
is not satisfactory. Fortunately, it could be remedied by using anot her prescription —
replacing the terms with coinciding indices by the so–called self–intera ction terms. Here
we propose the prescription for three–body interaction which is su ﬃcient for our current
purposes,

mm′, (18)
wherec3= 3 is a combinatorial factor related to the three possible ways of ha ving
coinciding pairs of indices in a triple summation. Obviously, the higher ne gative power
ofDmm′in (18) compared to the two–body term in (11) prevents one monom er from
falling on another.
It would be interesting to consider the coeﬃcient c3in Eq. (18) as an independent
parameter and to discuss how the inclusion of this term would change the equilibrium
and kinetics for the ring homopolymer [11]. Note that for the ring hom opolymer we can
reduce the number of independent elements in the matrix of mean sq uared distances,
Dmm′, by the factor of N, since due to the translational symmetry, Dm,m′=Dm+k,m′+k
6 YU.A. KUZNETSOV , E.G. TIMOSHENKO
for anykandm,m′. This symmetry allows us to reduce signiﬁcantly the computational
requirements.
In the good solvent regime, u(2)> u(3)>0, we ﬁnd no substantial change caused by
the self–interaction term (18). The deviations in the mean squared distances and in the
squared radius of gyration typically are less than 1% even for short chains. This is only
natural. In this regime this term is subdominant for long chains and ca n be neglected at
all in the thermodynamic limit.
However, the size and the structure of the homopolymer globule, w hich exists in the
regionu(2)<0, can change signiﬁcantly. In Fig. 1 we exhibit the diagram of globular
states. One can see that actually two diﬀerent globular states are possible, which we
call the non–compact globule (as one can see from Table I this globula r state possesses
a higher value of R2
g) and the liquid–like globule. The former is the thermodynamically
stable state atcomparativelysmall c3, whilst the latter existsat highervalues of c3andin
the region of large u(2). For large negative u(2)the transition between two globular states
becomes discontinuous and the transition line goes nearly vertically a t approximately
c3≈1/2. However, the collapse transition from the extended polymer coil to the liquid–
like globuleremainssecondorder. We found that this phase diagramis quite independent
of the degree of polymerization, at least in the range we could study numerically, 30 ≤
N≤200. Thus, introducing of the term (18), which is subdominant for la rge values of
Ncompared to other terms in (11), nevertheless dramatically chang es the properties of
the globular state even for very long chains.
Nowletuscomparethestructureofthenon–compactandtheliquid –likeglobules. In

with respect to the line m=N/2, i.e.D0,|m−m′|=D0,N−|m−m′|, for values of c3= 0,3.
In the right–hand side of the ﬁgure we draw the same quantity obta ined from Monte
Carlo simulations for a ring chain of hard spheres with the Lennard–J ones attraction
[15]. Since the parameters of excluded volume interactions in the mod el used for Monte
Carlo simulations are expressed in diﬀerent terms, only shape and sc aling behaviour, but
not the absolute values of each Dmm′, should be compared. We see a quite remarkable
agreement here. This is a strong argument in favour of the liquid–like globule. Its mean
squared distances have a typical saturation regime after compar atively small m. This is
known to be true of the globule from Monte Carlo simulations and prev ious results from
other methods [12]. The function, D0mfor the non–compact globule has much more
convex shape which, in fact, reﬂects the eﬀective monomer repuls ion on large distances
(see Eq. (17). Also, from Table I we can see that the asymptotic sc aling in the degree
of polymerisation for the size of the liquid–like globule, R2
g∼N2/3, is reached starting
from suﬃciently small Nin agreement with lattice Monte Carlo simulations [13], whilst
from much larger Nfor the non–compact globule [4].
Now, let us turn our attention to the kinetics at the collapse transit ion, after an
instantaneous change of the value of the second virial coeﬃcient f rom a positive to a
negative value, the latter corresponding to the globular equilibrium s tate. In Fig. 3 we
exhibit the evolution of the mean squared radii of gyration after qu enches to the liquid–
like and the non–compact globule. We found that the early stage pro ceeds in a similar
manner, while the middle or “coarsening” kinetic stage is somewhat slo wer for quenches
to the liquid–like globule, but the ﬁnal stages here are much faster. This can be seen
from Tab. I, where we present the values of the total collapse time [14] and the ﬁnal
relaxationtime, τffordiﬀerent sizes, N. The moststrikingthing hereis thatthe eﬀective
exponent of the ﬁnal relaxationtime is much smaller than what we hav e earlier expected,
γf= 5/3 (see Ref. [3, 4]). This also shifts down the eﬀective exponent of th e “total”
SELF–CONSISTENT TREATMENT OF COPOLYMERS WITH ARBITRARY SE QUENCES 7
collapse time, since the latter is a cross–over between the exponen t of the coarsening
stage,γm= 2, which is unaﬀected by the self–interaction term, and the expon ent of
the ﬁnal relaxation, γf. In principle, the ﬁnal relaxation time and its exponent in the
degree of polymerization can be determined without appealing to num erical solution of
the kinetic GSC equations. From Ref. [3] we have, τf∼NF1, whereF1is the ﬁrst
normal mode for the ﬁnal equilibrium globular state,
Fq=−1
2N/summationdisplay
mcos2πqm
ND0m. (19)
A good approximation for the function D0min the liquid–like globule would be the
following D0mis linearly increasing function of muntil some value D0m1=D, where the
N-dependence is, D∼m1∼N2/3and then it remains constant. This approximation
can also be obtained from the Lifshitz theory [12]. Now one can see th atF1∼N1/3and,
correspondingly, γf= 4/3, which is close to the value of the eﬀective exponent in Tab. I.
Thus, on the contrary to the coil state, for the liquid–like globule th e ﬁrst normal mode,
F1, neither gives the main contribution to the mean squared radius of g yration, nor even
has the same scaling law in the degree of polymerization, N.
Inclusionoftheself–interactionterm(18)alsostronglyaﬀectsth ephasediagramand
kinetic properties of rigid chains. We shall consider these questions in a separate work
[15]. Such modiﬁcations are rather welcome and allows one to make the GSC method
more accurate for the dense globular states, where its validity has been less established.
4. – Equilibrium Properties of Copolymer Sequences
The GSC equations (10) have been studied numerically using the ﬁfth order Runge–
Kutta algorithm with adaptive time step [16]. In fact, for copolymer s equences, consid-
ered in the current work, the time step during numerical integratio ns of Eqs. (10) varies
approximately 100 times. Thus, any integration scheme with ﬁxed tim e step is rather
unreliable here.
In studying the equilibrium we consider only stationary points of Eqs. (10), i.e. the
limitt→ ∞. If for some set of interaction parameters, ¯ u(2)and ∆, one obtains several
stationary states, one should compare the values of the variation al free energy, A. The
deepest minimum of the free energy corresponds to the thermody namically stable state,
the rest of the solutions to metastable states. Here we consider c opolymers with the ring
topology, though the current treatment may be easily extended f or study of copolymers
with any other topology just by changing the spring term in Eqs. (1, 11).
Typical phase diagrams in terms of the mean second virial coeﬃcient , ¯u(2), and the
amphiphilicity, ∆, in Eq. (2) for some “random” and periodic sequence s are presented
in Figs. 4-6. In the region ¯ u(2)>0 and for small values of amphiphilicity, ∆ <5, typical
conformations of copolymers are akin to the homopolymer extende d coil. By decreasing
¯u(2)to the negative region the chain undergoes the continuous collapse transition, simi-
larly to what we observed in Sec. 3. The collapse transition is characterised by a rapid
fall of the radius of gyration, R2
g, (15) and the change of the fractal dimension, ν(see
Tab. I).
The collapse transition for larger values of amphiphilicity turns out to be more com-
plicated, and essentiallydependent onthe sequence. The globulars tate forlargevaluesof
∆ is diﬀerent from the liquid–like globule. It is characterized by somewh at higher value
ofthe radiusofgyrationandextremely largevalue ofthe MPS order parameter(16), thus
8 YU.A. KUZNETSOV , E.G. TIMOSHENKO
we call this state the MPS globule. The MPS globule is separated from t he liquid–like
one by a weak continuous transition (see Figs. 4-6). In the case of long blocks (Fig. 6)
the collapse transition to the MPS globule becomes discontinuous (ﬁr st–order–like). The
spinodals I’ and I” designate the region where two distinct states c orresponding to the
coil and the MPS globule can be found. The depths of the free energ y minima become
exactly equal on the transition curve I in Fig. 6.
However, for a wide class of sequences, for example for aperiodic s equences in Figs.
4, 5, the phase diagram at large amphiphilicity, ∆, is much more complica ted. Starting
fromsomevalueof∆insomeintermediateregionof ¯ u(2)thereappearadditionalsolutions
corresponding to local minima of the free energy. The broad region where this could take
place is bounded by the curves I’ and II” in Figs. 4, 5. With increasing ∆ the number of
such solutions grows quickly. Signiﬁcantly, in the region of the phase diagram, between
curves I and II in Figs. 4, 5, some of these possess the lowest free energy value, thus
being the thermodynamically stable state. Since the number of such solutions is rather
high even for short sequences and their number grows quickly with t he chain length,
we do not attempt to draw all their boundaries of (meta)stability. W e shall call them
collectively as frustrated phases , explaining this terminology below.
Now let us compare the phase diagrams in Figs. 4 and 5, the latter cor responding
to the sequence twice longer than the for former. An interesting o bservation is that
the region between spinodals I’ and II”, designating where the fru strated phases can
exist, expands dramatically with increasing chain length. The same co ncerns the region
of thermodynamically stable frustrated phases between curves I and II. More exactly,
these regions expand downwards and to the left, so that the posit ion of curves I’ and I
change slightly with increasing N, whilst curves II and II” depend signiﬁcantly on the
size of the system. For rather long chains we may expect that the r egions of stability
and metastability of the frustrated phases will continue to expand downwards and to
the left, so that the lines II and II” will become nearly vertical, displa cing the region of
stable MPS globule. Probably, for most of long heteropolymer chains the MPS globule
does not exist as thermodynamically stable state, becoming stable o nly for some special
sequences. Unfortunately, we can not proceed with numerical so lution for much larger
system sizes, N, since the calculational expenses grow in NasN3per iteration and also
the total number of frustrated states becomes huge for large s ystem sizes. This diversity
and a special foliating structure of various branches leads in the th ermodynamic limit to
what is known as a spin glass frozen phase [17] of random copolymers .
Let us consider the conformational structure of the frustrate d states for the copoly-
mer consisting of repeating ’ ab’ blocks. The phase diagram of this sequence also exhibits
the thermodynamically stable frustrated phases [7] starting from approximately N= 28.
In Figs. 7 and 8 we present the dependence of the observables in (1 5, 16) at a quasistatic
change of the mean second virial coeﬃcient, ¯ u(2), from the coil state to the MPS globule
and back. From these pictures one can see in the intermediate regio n only a few (seven
to be precise) of all possible frustrated phases. The values of the radius of gyration and
the MPS order parameter are intermediate for these solutions, lyin g between those of
the coil and the MPS globule. In this sense, we can call them non–fully compacted and
misfolded states.
In the series of pictures in Fig. 9 we present the matrix of mean squa red distances,
Dmm′, for the copolymer, consisting of ’ ab’ blocks at some values of the mean second
virial coeﬃcient, ¯ u(2). The set of Dmm′in the GSC method completely determines the
conformational structure of any, equilibrium or kinetic, state. Fo r positive ¯ u(2)(see
Fig. 9a) the mean squared distances possess the structure typic al for the extended coil.
SELF–CONSISTENT TREATMENT OF COPOLYMERS WITH ARBITRARY SE QUENCES 9
The elements of the matrix, Dmm′, increase monotonically on moving away from its
diagonals towards the distance of half–ring along the chain. Thus, t heDmm′matrix
may be approximated here by a monotonically increasing function of t he chain distance,
|m−m′|. Decreasing the mean second virial coeﬃcient, ¯ u(2), causes the copolymer to
pass through frustrated states, in Figs. 9b-9d, ﬁnally reachingt he MPS globule state (see
Fig. 9e). The characteristic feature of the Dmm′matrix in a frustrated state is that it
possesses some number of monomer groups having smaller distance s between each other
than between monomers from other groups. Clearly, such a group represents a cluster
of monomers, so that here the copolymer chain forms a set of clust ers (approximately
8 clusters in Fig. 9b, 4 clusters in Fig. 9c and 2 clusters in Fig. 9d), eac h consisting of
monomers nearest along the chain.
The internal structure of each cluster is similar to the structure o f the ﬁnal MPS
globule. Forthesimplestcopolymersequencepresentedhere, the Dmm′matrixawayfrom
the diagonal can be divided into sub–matrices of the size 2 ×2 (see top of the Fig. 9e),
each of which possesses approximately the same structure: small values in the upper
left corner correspond to the mean squared distances between h ydrophobic monomers;
large values in the lower right corner, which are the mean squared dis tances between
hydrophilic monomers; and oﬀ-diagonal elements are nearly equal a nd correspond to
the distances between diﬀerent species. Thus, for the MPS globule , such structure of the
Dmm′matrix reﬂects the structure ofthe two–bodyinteraction matrix ,u(2)
mm′. Obviously,
the higher correlation between these two matrices is manifested in t he higher value of
the MPS order parameter. For another, more complicated, seque nces the Dmm′matrix
in the MPS globular state has a diﬀerent structure, but still it resem bles in some way
the interaction matrix, u(2)
mm′away from the diagonal, being distorted by the spring
interactions in the elements close to the diagonal. Note that for the liquid–like globule
the pattern of the Dmm′matrix looks suﬃciently trivial. Namely, it has narrow band of
dark color along the main diagonal with its intensity quickly decreasing , as one can see
from Fig. 9f.
FromFig.9onecanseethattheinteractionsymmetriesimposedbyt heEFEF(1)are
spontaneously broken in the region of the phase diagram correspo nding to the frustrated
phases. Obviously, in our case the number of possible ways to break the symmetry
is enormously huge and moreover it grows exponentially with increasin g system size.
Despite thekinematicsymmetriesarenotpresentforarbitraryse quences, thestructureof
the phase diagram(see Figs. 4, 5) and behaviourof main observable sremain verysimilar.
It is the particular structure of Dmm′matrix, number and the shape of boundaries of
frustrated phases that are quite sensitive to the sequence. The symmetry that may
be broken in this case has a subtler meaning and may be expressed in t erms of the
replica formalism [17]. Consider, for example, two nearly identical bloc ks with nearly
identical surroundings. In the coil and the MPS globular states one should expect the
conformationalmatricesoftheseblockstobe nearlyequaltoeac hother. Onthecontrary,
the small diﬀerence in the interactions in the region of frustrated p hases may lead to a
huge diﬀerence in the conformations. Thus, it is by no means surpris ing that the replica
symmetry breaking in the case of periodic systems takes such an ex plicit manifestation
in the breaking of the block translational symmetry.
An important point here is that the frustrated phases become dom inant in an inter-
mediate region of the phase diagram not due to a low mean energy, bu t mostly due to a
higher entropy. The MPS globule is entropically unfavourable there b ecause the overall
shrinking force is insuﬃciently strong. Also, in the regime of nearly co mpensating repul-

sion and attraction between monomers it is more preferable to achie ve phase separation
on a smaller, than the globular, scale by forming clusters.
5. – Folding Kinetics
Here we shall consider the time evolution of the conformational sta te of a copoly-
mer away from the initial equilibrium after it has been subjected to an instantaneous
temperature jump that causes the two–body interaction parame ters in Eq. (2), ¯ u(2)and
∆, to change. The composition of copolymer {σ}and the rest of parameters remain
the same and do not change with time. We are interested in quenches from the ho-
mopolymer coil, where all monomers are equally hydrophilic (¯ u(2)>0 and ∆ = 0), to
the region of parameters corresponding to the MPS globular state , so that the ‘ a’ species
became strongly hydrophobic and the ‘ b’ species remained nearly neutral (¯ u(2)≪0
and ∆≈ |¯u(2)|). Here we consider some binary copolymer systems, consisting of t he
same number of ’ a’ and ’b’ monomers and of the same size, N= 50, and quench,
(¯u(2)= 15,∆ = 0)→(¯u(2)=−35,∆ = 30).
Let us ﬁrst discuss the general features of the kinetics of the co polymer folding. The
time evolution of the mean squared radius of gyration, R2
g(t), the MPS order parameter,
Ψ(t), and the instantaneous free energy, A(t), is presented in Figs. 10, 11. Here lines
A correspond to the homopolymer and serve for reference purpo uses. In the case of
the homopolymer one can see that R2
gandAdecrease monotonically to their equilibrium
values correspondingto the liquid–like globule state, while Ψremains ide ntically zero. As
for the copolymer kinetics, the ﬁrst observation consists in that it proceeds much slower
than for the homopolymer. For example, for the simplest copolymer sequence, ’( ba)25’,
the total collapse time [14] is more than 3 times longer than that of th e homopolymer,
other copolymer sequences collapsing even longer. The total collap se time also seems to
be quite sensitive to the copolymer sequence. Since the micro–phas e separation is one
of the main factors in collapse of copolymers, the MPS order parame ter, Ψ, grows in
kinetics most of the time for all considered sequences, though rat her nonmonotonically.
Nevertheless, for some sequences it might be negative during some time in kinetics (see
e.g. sequences E and F in Fig. 11b), something we never observed at equilibrium.
The evolution of the instantaneous free energy, A(t), depicted in Figs. 10c, 11c, is
most unusual. Typically it proceeds through multiple accelerations an d decelerations.
The ﬂat regions of a staircase–like function correspond to tempor ary kinetic arrest of the
system in transient nonequilibrium conformations, i.e. to transient t rappings of various
members of the ensemble in their local shallow energy minima. Since suc h minima are
encountered at diﬀerent moments in time for diﬀerent members of t he ensemble, their
inﬂuence on the overall time evolution of averaged observables is ma nifested in a smooth
characteristicslowingdown. Noteherethatthenumberofstepsin kineticsprocesshardly
can be guessed from the given primary sequence. Typically, the kine tics for sequences
with smaller number of blocks proceeds through smaller number of st eps. For example,
folding of the periodic sequence consisting of long blocks, ’( b5a5)5(see line E in Fig. 11c),
proceeds through only one, though rather long, kinetically arrest ed step. However, for
the aperiodic sequence of long blocks (line F in Fig. 11c) we can see at le ast six such
steps, the third one being the longest in time.
Now let us consider the nonequilibrium conformations, given by the ma trix of the
mean squared distances between monomers, Dmm′. In Fig. 12 we exhibit the Dmm′ma-
trix for ’( ba)25’ sequence at diﬀerent times in the folding kinetics. We can see that k inetic
process proceeds through formation of locally collapsed and phase –separated clusters.
SELF–CONSISTENT TREATMENT OF COPOLYMERS WITH ARBITRARY SE QUENCES 11
The initial conformation is similar to Fig. 9a, then at time t= 3.6 we can see approx-
imately 10 clusters (Fig. 12a), at time t= 5.75 — 6 clusters (Fig. 12b) and at t= 8.6
— 4 clusters (Fig. 12c). During later evolution these four clusters a pproach each other
since, as one can see from Fig. 12d, the inter–cluster distances ar e much smaller than
in Fig. 12c. Finally, the clusters unify forming the MPS globule, the Dmm′matrix of
which is quite similar to that presented in Fig. 9e. We should note here a lso that these
nonequilibrium states do not possess the translational block symme try, present for the
system in the EFEF and the initial conditions. After some time in kinetic s,t≈1 this
symmetry breaks down, and restores only during ﬁnal kinetic stag es at time moment
t≈15.
However, the formal structure of the GSC kinetic equations (10) is such that they
yield a symmetric solution at any moment in time if one proceeds from th e symmetric
initial condition. What we observe here is a spontaneous symmetry b reaking in kinetics.
Namely, at some moment in time the symmetric solution of the kinetic eq uations be-
comes unstable with respect to perturbations, whether of the init ial condition, or of the
interaction matrix, u(2)
nn′. In the exact theory there are ﬂuctuations that can transform
between diﬀerent spontaneously broken states in kinetics, thus d estroying the unstable
symmetric state. To describe such phenomena strictly in the frame work of the Gaussian
method, which presents an improved, but still a mean–ﬁeld type of t heory, we should
include explicitly an inﬁnitesimal symmetry breaking term εnn′to the two–body inter-
action matrix, u(2)
mm′, and consider the limit of vanishing perturbation in the solution.
In fact, in numerical integration such a regularisation procedure is not even necessary,
since there is always an intrinsic perturbation due to computer roun d oﬀ and numerical
integration errors. Thus, if the symmetry is favourable to be kinet ically broken some-
where, numerically one obtains some spontaneously broken solution s there, rather than
the unstable symmetric solution, unless the symmetry conditions ha ve been imposed by
hand. In fact, adding a rather small perturbation matrix, εnn′, changes the behaviour of
the global observables, such as R2
g, Ψ,Aand characteristic kinetic times rather insigniﬁ-
cantly. However, what can be changed by including of a perturbatio n is the centers along
the chain around which clusters form and grow.
Finally, let us discuss how the folding kinetics depends on the sequenc e. In series of
pictures in Fig. 10 we present kinetic processes for the simplest cop olymer consisting of
’ab’ blocks (sequence B), and also for some sequences obtained by ce rtain modiﬁcations
in it. In the sequence denoted by C in Fig. 10 we have replaced ten sho rt blocks by
four of longer size. In the sequence D we have inserted only two hyd rophobic and two
hydrophilic fragments into the sequence, i.e. we have made only two p ermutations. For
the former sequence the total kinetic time became approximately 1 .7 times longer than
thatfortheBsequence. Theﬁnalvaluesofthefreeenergyforb othsequencesBandCare
nearly the same, whilst the micro–phase separation is somewhat bet ter for the modiﬁed
sequence C, due to longer blocks. Thus, for that sequence the kin etic properties do not
deteriorate very much, except that kinetic process takes essen tially longer. However, the
kinetic foldability of the D sequence is much more poor than for B and C sequences. In
fact, here not only the kinetic process takes much longer, but the ﬁnal state is diﬀerent
from the MPS globule. As one can see from Fig. 13 the ﬁnal kinetic sta te for the D
sequence consists of two clusters. These clusters are connecte d by two links, formed by
nearly neutral fragments, ’ b2’. Further collapse of this conformation is unfavourable due
to the entropy and partial screening of hydrophobic monomers by nearly neutral species
’b’. Size of such misfolded state is larger and the MPS order parameter is approximately
12 YU.A. KUZNETSOV , E.G. TIMOSHENKO
twice smaller than what we could expect for the MPS globule. As we hav e already seen
kinetics of sequences consisting of longer blocks is also quite sensitiv e to the sequence.
Some modiﬁcations of the periodic sequence E in Fig. 11 to form aperio dic long blocks
sequence, F, result in somewhat longer, but much more complicated , kinetic processes.
6. – Conclusion
In this paper we applied the extended GSC method to studying the eq uilibrium and
kinetic phenomena of some particular amphiphilic heteropolymer sequ ences. First, we
have revised the Gaussian theory to include the self–interaction te rm (18). Thus, the
two–body term in our formalism describes the eﬀective interactions between monomers,
the self–interaction term is responsible for stability of the globular s tate, and the three–
body interactions between distinct monomers provide the correct scaling of the size of
the globule. The structure of the homopolymer globule is now in bette r agreement with
the one obtained from other methods. We have found that the kine tic laws of the ring
homopolymerdo not changesigniﬁcantlydue to introduction ofthe s elf–interactionterm,
except for the ﬁnal relaxation time, which without hydrodynamic int eraction scales with
the degree of polymerization as, τf∼N4/3.
We have obtained typical phase diagrams for heteropolymers cons isting of short and
long blocks. For sequences with rather frustrated interactions a long the chain, apart
from the coil, the liquid–like and the micro–phase separated globular s tates, we have
discovered that in a wide intermediate region of the phase diagram th ere may be a large
number offrustratedpartiallymisfolded states. Someofsuch sta tes, the number ofwhich
grows exponentially with the chain length, become the dominant ther modynamic state
in rather narrow domains. We may conclude that the transition to th ese states for large
systems corresponds to a glassy freezing transition.
For large amphiphilicity parameter collapse from the extended coil st ate to the MPS
globule for a wide class of sequences proceeds at equilibrium through these frustrated
phases. Atypicalcopolymerconformationhereis asetofmicro–ph aseseparatedclusters.
On approaching the MPS globule quasistatically the number of cluster s decreases, reach-
ing only one cluster in the ﬁnal MPS globular state. A typical cluster s ize is determined
by some characteristic range where the micro–phase separation m ay occur.
We have discovered that the region of meta– and thermodynamic st ability of the
frustrated phases expands with system size displacing the region o f the MPS globule.
It is quite likely that the thermodynamically stable MPS globule for hete ropolymers
of several hundreds of monomers is possible only for a narrow class of some special
sequences. Also it is likely that inclusion of other interactions, such a s electrostatic,
and thus modiﬁcation of the two–body interaction matrix in Eq. (2), may additionally
stabilise the MPS globule.
We ﬁnd that the kinetics of folding from the coil to the MPS globule for copolymers
takes much longer than for the homopolymer since it is strongly aﬀec ted by the presence
of the transient frustrated states along the kinetic pathway. Th is leads to a complicated
kinetic process consisting of multiple steps with pronounced slowing d own and then
acceleration in the folding rate. We also present here some preliminar y studies on how
the folding kinetics depends on the primary heteropolymer sequenc e. Typically, the
kinetics for copolymers consisting of long blocks proceeds in a smaller number of steps,
but not necessarily faster, than kinetics for short block copolyme rs. For the latter we
have seen that even small modiﬁcations of the sequence may chang e crucially the overall
kinetic behaviour and even the ﬁnal kinetic state itself.
SELF–CONSISTENT TREATMENT OF COPOLYMERS WITH ARBITRARY SE QUENCES 13
There is an interesting arena here for classiﬁcation of sequences a nd conformational
states. Moving in this direction would allow to develop better models fo r proteins, which
sequences have been specially optimised by the biological evolution.
Finally, we hope that the way is now open for constructing the non–G aussian exten-
sion to the self–consistent method. This is diﬃcult since the closure r elations for higher–
order correlation functions are nontrivial for polymers. When tha t is accomplished one
could speak of real predictive accuracy of the method.
