Pattern storage by a single neuron is revisited. Generaliz-
ing Parisi’s framework for spin glasses we obtain a variatio nal
free energy functional for the neuron. The solution is demon -
strated at high temperature and large relative number of ex-
amples, where several phases are identiﬁed by thermodynam-
ical stability analysis, two of them exhibiting spontaneou s full
replica symmetry breaking. We give analytically the curved
segments of the order parameter function and in representa-
tive cases compute the free energy, the storage error, and th e
entropy.

Statistical physical modeling of neural networks a-
chieved much success in the description of neural phe-
nomena, ranging from storage and retrieval in memory
networks to learning and generalization in feed-forward
networks to unsupervised learning [1]. Whereas some
models for a single neuron are admittedly oversimpli-
ﬁed from the biological viewpoint, when networked they
exhibit a variety of neural functions, performed by liv-
ing systems and demanded from artiﬁcial designs. In
this Letter we study a single perceptron-type neuron’s
memorization ability, crucial for the understanding of
networked systems. When the number of synaptic cou-
plings of a neuron becomes large the storageproblem can
be described via the statistical mechanical framework in-
troduced by Gardner and Derrida [2,3]. Since then the
neuron is well understood below capacity, the region be-
yond it, however, remained the subject of continuous re-
search and debate [4–9]. We claim that the framework
presented here carriesthe exact statistical mechanicalso-
lution, which we illustrate on a partly analytically treat-
able limiting case. Networks beyond saturation are long
known to have complex features; here we show that even
a single neuron can exhibit extreme complexity.
We consider the McCulloch-Pitts model neuron [1],
ξ= sign(h), h=N−1/2/summationdisplayN
i=1JiSi, (1)
whereJis the vector of synaptic couplings, Sthe input
andξthe response. The normalization was chosen so
thathis typically of O(1) when N→ ∞. Patterns to
be stored are prescribed as pairs {Sµ,ξµ}M
µ=1such that
the neuron is required to generate ξµin response to Sµ.
Given the ensemble of patterns, the local stability pa-
rameter ∆µ=hµξµobeys some distribution ρ(∆) (see
[4]). The µ-th pattern is stored by the neuron if theactual response signal from Eq. (1) equals the desired
outputξµ,i. e., ∆µ>0. The number of patterns M
is generically of order N, soα=M/Nis an intensive
parameter. For the sake of simplicity, we generate the
Sµ
i-s independently from a normal distribution, consider
ξµ=±1 equally likely, and choose the spherical prior
constraint |J|=√
N. The cost function to be minimized,
i. e., the Hamiltonian, is the sum of errors committed on
the patterns. The error on the µ-th pattern is measured
by a potential V(∆µ), taken here to be zero for argu-
ments larger than a given κand decreasing elsewhere [4].
Storage as deﬁned above corresponds to κ= 0, while a
κ >0 means a stricter requirement on the local stability
∆ and ensures a ﬁnite basin of attraction for a memo-
rized pattern during retrieval. The Hamiltonian deﬁnes
through gradient descent a dynamics in coupling space.
Speciﬁcally, V(y) = (κ−y)bθ(κ−y) corresponds to the
perceptron and adatron rules for b= 1,2, respectively.
There is no such dynamics in the case b= 0, but because
ofits prominent static meaning – the Hamiltonian counts
the incorrectly stored patterns – we will consider that in
concrete calculations.
The Hamiltonian introduced above gives rise to a
statistical mechanical system [2] resembling models of
spin glasses with inﬁnite-range interactions [10]. The
microstates are conﬁgurations of synaptic couplings,
quenched disorder is due to the randomly generated pat-
terns, and the temperature T=β−1represents the tol-
erance to error of storage. The partition function is

The extremization problem (3,4) was ﬁrst solved with
the assumption of replica symmetry (RS) [2,3]. Be-
yond capacity at zero temperature, however, Bouten
[5] showed by rectifying [2,3] that whenever the lo-
cal stability distribution function ρ(∆) exhibits a gap,
there is an eigenvalue in negative inﬁnity of the Hes-
sian∂2f(Q)/∂qab∂qcdat the RS solution, so this is not
a minimum in (3). Such is the case for the potential
V(y) =θ(y−κ). Theonestep replicasymmetrybreaking
(1-RSB)ansatzwasconsideredfor T= 0, yieldinga ρ(∆)
diﬀerent from the RS result, and, as demanded from an
improved solution, a larger energy [6–8]. In the ground
statebeyondcapacity, whereall qab→1, aneigenvalueof
negative inﬁnity has been found recently for any R-step
RSB (R-RSB), and for illustration the 2-RSB solution
computed [9]. The results show a slight improvement
over 1-RSB in the energy and a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in
thescaledelementsof Q, but alsothe2-RSBgroundstate
turned out to be unstable. Ref. [9] in fact implied that a
gap inρ(∆) atT= 0 means the instability of all R-RSB
solutions with Rﬁnite.
In order to treat the storage problem of the neu-
ron we technically generalize Parisi’s method for the
Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model of spin glasses (see
[10]). By Parisi’s choice of Qand his continuation rule
in then→0 limit, the SK free energy was expressed in
terms of an order parameter function. An elegant and
useful re-formulation was due to [11], whose free energy
functional for the SK problem incorporated both Parisi’s
and Sompolinsky’s partial diﬀerential equations (PPDE
and SPDE, resp.). Its analog was used for the Little-
Hopﬁeld (LH) memory network in [12]. For the neuron,
we adopt Parisi’s form for Q, momentarily as an ansatz,
but thermodynamical stability analysis reported about
later amounts to its consistency check. Our calculations
show that despite the signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the
SK and the neuron Hamiltonians and those between the
’hard’ terms in the replica free energies, the variational
free energies are remarkably similar. We obtain [13]

The minimization in (3) turned to maximization due to
its interchange with the n→0 limit [10]. Here and later
˙h=∂h/∂qandh′=∂h/∂y. Thex(q) is the inverse of
Parisi’s order parameter function, i. e., it gives the prob-
ability that the overlap of the synaptic vectors from two
replicas is smaller than q, andD(q) =/integraltext1
qd¯qx(¯q) is the
continuation of the spectrum of the matrix Qforn→0.
The range 1 ≥q≥0 is now included in the ansatz, that
should be veriﬁed later. The auxiliary functionals f(1,2)
a
carry the Lagrange multiplier ﬁeld P(q,y) and thus van-
ish at stationarity. Variation by P(q,y) makes the ﬁeld
f(q,y)satisfythePPDE,whichcanbereadoﬀfrom(7d),
and that by P(1,y) ﬁxes the initial condition through
(7e). So f(q,y) evolves from q= 1 toq= 0 and its ﬁnal
value gives the energy term in (7c). Stationarity in terms
off(q,y) andf(0,y) leads to the SPDE
˙P(q,y) =1
2P′′(q,y)+βx(q)[P(q,y)f′(q,y)]′,(8)
evolving from P(0,y) =δ(y) untilq= 1. Comparison
with the SKmodel [11], its p-spingeneralization[14], and
the LHnetwork[12] showsthat the respectivePDE-sand
P(0,y) arethe same, but in our casea generalinitial con-
ditionf(1,y) =V(y) is taken. In fact, the ’hard’ term of
theSKreplicafreeenergyisformallyaspecialcaseof(4c)
ifV(y) = ln2cosh y. Variation of (7a) in terms of explicit
occurrences of x(q) yields (2 β)−1/integraltext1

is simultaneously a function of qand a functional of

ity requires that F= 0. If x(q)≡m, 0< m < 1,
in an interval Ithen stationarity in terms of mleads
to Maxwell’s rule/integraltext

the above scheme: required is F= 0 at each of the points
q(R)
0,...,q(R)
Rand so is the Maxwell rule in the intervals
between them ( cf.[15] in a special case). Note that the
free energy can be written in short as max x(q)[fs+αfe]
with (7b,7c), where f(q,y) satisﬁes the PPDE with the
initial condition as above; that corresponds to Parisi’s
original formulation.
Thermodynamical stability analysis requires the diag-
onalization of the Hessian of f(Q) in Eq. (4). Based on
2
the general expression of Ref. [16] we calculated a subset
of eigenvalues from the replicon sector of the R-RSB, in-
cludingλ(R)(R) =˙F(q(R)
R,[x(¯q)])thatderivesfromstates
in the same smallest cluster. The λ(R)(R) is typically de-
cisive for stability [15,14], and becomes negative inﬁnity
atT= 0 for any R-RSB with ﬁnite Rifρ(∆) has a gap
[5,9]. Concerning the maximizing x(q) of (7), if ˙ x(q)>0
in an interval Ithen the continuation of the aforemen-
tioned subset is λ(q) =˙F(q,[x(¯q)]), soλ(q)≡0 inI,
thus zero modes are present. This is a generic property
of a Parisi phase [17].
The distribution of the local stability ∆ is found to be
of a remarkably simple form [13]
ρ(∆) =P(1,∆). (10)
That sheds light on the physical meaning of the auxiliary
ﬁeldP(q,y):yis the local stability at an intermediate
generation of the ultrametric tree and P(q,y) its proba-
bility distribution. The analogy with the local magnetic
ﬁeld in the SK and LH models [11,18,12] is apparent.
Classic neural modeling focuses on T= 0. To solve
that problem, however, extensive numerical work may
be necessary. On the other hand, in the limit α, T→ ∞
whileγis kept ﬁnite, we can calculate x(q) wherever it
deviates from the step-like shape, thence other analytic
results follow. By resolving the PPDE and the SPDE
perturbatively we obtain f(q,y) andP(q,y) as function-
als ofx(q) toO(β2), yielding explicit functional forms for
the free energy (7) as well as for (9). Another possibility
is ﬁrst expanding (4) in βand then applying the Parisi
ansatz. Either way we arrive at

cf.Eq. (9) in [19]. Various trial functions x(q), such
as anR-RSB, or, Parisi’s ansatz of a continuous orderparameter function between two plateaux (such a clas-
sic Parisi phase will be referred to as SG-I), can be for-
mulated by means of (12). We calculated the full set
of replicon eigenvalues of R-RSB based on [16]. With

Four distinct phases are found and depicted on Fig. 1.
At the boundary of the transition RS—SG-I, further-
more, at the RS—1-RSB line for κ < κ2, if the border is
approached from the RSB phase, the x(q) function con-
verges for each 0 ≤q≤1 to the RS value q(0). Here the
3rd derivative of the mean free energy is discontinuous.
On the other hand, for κ > κ 2, if the RS–1-RSB line
is approached from the RSB side then q(1)
0→q(0)but
q(1)
1/ne}ationslash→q(0). The plateau value m(1)
1→1 so the limits
ofx(q) from the two phases diﬀer at one point q= 1.
At that transition the 2nd derivative of the free energy
is discontinuous. This phenomenon is analogous to the
RS—1-RSB transition in the random energy model (see
[10]), and similar two types of segments of the RS—1-
RSBborderlinewereidentiﬁedinthespherical, p-spinSK
model by [15]. The RS—SG-I boundary is analogous to
the Parisi transition in the SK model. We found a fourth
phase, where x(q) is like an SG-I curve joined with a 1-
step function. It is ofthe same type asthe phase PG II of
the Potts spin glass [20], and the low-temperature state
of thep-spin SK model [14], furthermore, it is analogous
to the phase SG-IV of [21]. The borderline λ(0)(0) = 0
of local stability of the RS state, i. e., the de Almeida--
Thouless (AT) curve, coincides with the border of the RS
phase for κ < κ 2but enters the RSB phases for larger
κ-s. However, whenever RS and RSB states coexist, we
ﬁnd that the RSB state maximizes the free energy func-
tional(7). No coexistencebetweendiﬀerenttypes ofRSB
phases was observed. One characteristic x(q) function
from each phase is shown on Fig. 2. Note that if x(q)
has a curved segment, this is explicitly given by Eqs.
(13,15). For illustration, thermodynamic quantities are
plotted along the κ= 0 line on Fig. 3. We expect that
for some ﬁnite temperatures similar phases exist, never-
theless, in the ground state the phase diagram simpliﬁes
to the single borderline RS—SG-I, i. e., the known limit
of capacity curve. The richness of the neural behavior
forT→ ∞should be contrasted with the generic RS
high-T-phase in SK-type disordered magnets.
In conclusion, we have put forth an exact description
of storage by a single neuron in terms of a variational
free energy, the solution of which we demonstrated in the
highTlimit with the error counting potential. Storage
3
beyond capacity with other error measures, learning and
generalizationofunlearnabletasks, storageby networked
neurons, and frustrated phases in general, are natural
directions for future investigations.
