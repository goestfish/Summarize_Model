1 Introduction
The present paper studies a feedback regulation problem that aris es in at least
two diﬀerent biological applications. The feedback regulation proble m under
consideration may be interpreted as an adaptive control problem, but has not
yet been studied in the control literature. The goal of the paper is to introduce
this problem and to present some ﬁrst results.
The feedback regulation problem is concerned with a forced dynamic al sys-
tem
˙x=fµ(x,u(t)) (1)
which depends on a parameter µ. The input u(t) in equation (1) represents an
external stimulus; it is not a control variable. We are interested in t he input-
to-state properties of equation (1). In general, the input-to-s tate properties
of equation (1) depend on the parameter µ. In particular, the input-to-state
propertiesmaychangedrasticallyasafunction of µwhentheunforceddynamics
exhibitabifurcation. Inthiscase,quiteinterestingandremarkable ampliﬁcation
properties may result from operating in the proximity of the bifurca tion point.
We illustrate this with two biological examples from the literature.
The ﬁrst example is concerned with the auditory system. In order t o detect
the sounds of the outside world, hair cells in the cochlea operate as n anosen-
sors which transform acoustic stimuli into electric signals. In a serie s of recent

papers [4, 5, 6, 7], the hair cells in the cochlea are modeled as active, a lmost
self-oscillating systems. Ions such as Ca++are believed to contribute to the
hair cell’s tendency to exhibit spontaneous oscillations. For low conce ntrations
of the ions, the viscous damping forces of the ﬂuid that surrounds the hair cells
dominate and the hair cell oscillations are damped. As the concentra tion in-
creasesthe system undergoes a Hopf bifurcation, the dynamics b ecome unstable
and the hair cells exhibit spontaneous oscillations. It is argued in thes e papers
that the hair cells operate in the proximity of this bifurcation point, w here
the activity of the ions compensates the damping eﬀects. In this ca se, even a
weak sound stimulus can cause a detectable oscillation. (This follows f rom the
generic properties of a forced dynamical system exhibiting a Hopf b ifurcation).
This mechanism thus provides an explanation for the experimentally o bserved
ultrahigh sensitivity of the ear.
The second example arises in the study of persistent neural activit y [3, 12,
14, 13]. Neural activity of a single neuron has a natural tendency t o decay with
a relaxation time of about 5–100 ms. This natural tendency to deca y can be
opposed by positive synaptic feedback loops. If this feedback is we ak, then the
natural tendency to decay dominates and neural activity still dec reases. As the
feedback gain is increased, the neural dynamics undergo a bifurca tion and the
dynamics become unstable. When the feedback is tuned to exactly b alance the
decay, then neural activity neither increases nor decreases but persists without
change. According to a long-standing hypothesis, this is the mecha nism that so-
called neural integrators use to maintain persistent neural activit y. A transient
stimulus of a neural integrator can then cause a persistent chang e in neural
activity. This mechanism forms the basis for short-term analogue m emory and
plays a central role in the oculomotor control system.
Both examples illustrate the remarkable and interesting input-to-s tate prop-
erties of a dynamical system poised at a bifurcation. It is clear, how ever, that
operatingin the proximityofabifurcationpoint requiresaﬁne-tunin g ofparam-
eters. And thus the question arises as to how a (biological) system c an be tuned
with high precisionto its critical bifurcation point. In both examplesit has been
suggested that feedback regulation of the bifurcation paramete r may provide a
robust mechanism to ensure the required ﬁne-tuning of paramete rs [4, 6, 3, 16].
In the literature on hearing this has given rise to the terminology of “ self-tuned
Hopf bifurcation”. Quite remarkably both studies have been pursu ed indepen-
dently of each other in spite of their strong similarities which are obvio us from
a control engineering perspective.
The present paper aims to initiate a mathematical study of this feed back
regulation problem. The problem may be formulated as follows. Find an adap-
tation law which steers the bifurcation parameter µto its critical value µ0
without prior knowledge of this critical value µ0. Our main motivation for
studying this problem stems from the fact that the precise biophys ical nature
of the feedback mechanisms involved in the above biological applicatio ns is still
unknown. A theoretical study of this problem may guide the search for pos-
sible biophysical mechanisms. Even when the precise biophysical ada ptation
mechanisms will have been discovered, it is to be expected that a pro found un-
2
derstanding of the mechanisms involved can only be achieved when ins ight has
been gained in the fundamental trade-oﬀs and limitations that may b e inherent
to this problem. This is very similar in spirit to the internal model princip le
which has turned out to be central to the understanding of adapt ation in bacte-
rial chemotaxis [17], and it may be seen as an illustration of the importa nt role
that control engineering may play in the emerging ﬁeld of systems bio logy.
A second motivation for the present study is of a more fundamenta l nature.
In view of the quite remarkable and interesting input-to-state pro perties that
arise when operating in the proximity of a bifurcation point, the prob lem under
considerationmayturnouttobeofindependentinterest. Despite itsmathemat-
ical appeal, it has not attracted attention before in the control c ommunity. The
present paper brings together severalwell-established techniqu es from nonlinear
and adaptive control to derive some ﬁrst results for this problem.
We end this introduction with some references to related work. The present
research bears some similarity with the problem of experimental inst ability de-
tection [2], where an operating parameter is adapted online in order t o eﬃ-
ciently locate bifurcations through experiments. A diﬀerent proble m which is
related to the present study concerns the detection and predict ion of instabili-
ties via closed-loop monitoring techniques [9, 10]. The possible implicatio ns of
the present work for the problems studied in these papers remains a topic for
further research.
2 Self-tuning of a ﬁrst-order system
The one-dimensional system
˙x= (µ−µ0)x+u(t) (2)
captures some of the essential features of the neural integrat or. In this interpre-
tationµ0represents the natural decay rate of neural activity and µcorresponds
to the synaptic feedback gain. We view µas an adjustable parameter and µ0as
an unknown constant. Clearly this system exhibits a bifurcation. If µ=µ0then
equation (2) behaves as a perfect integrator, if µ < µ 0(respectively µ > µ 0)
then equation (2) is referred to as a leaky(respectively unstable) integrator. We
ask the question as to how proximity to the bifurcation point may be e nsured.
We study this question from an engineering perspective. In a ﬁrst a pproxi-
mation we ignore the presence of the input and ask the following simple r ques-
tion. Find an adaptation law for the parameter µwhich steers µto its bifurca-
tion value µ0for the system
˙x= (µ−µ0)x. (3)
This adaptation law may depend on xandµ, but should be independent of µ0,
as this value is not known (precisely). Let us ﬁrst discuss the feasib ility of this
problem. It is easy to see that if x= 0 at some time instant then x= 0 for
all times and in this case it is clearly impossible to steer µtoµ0without prior
3
knowledge of µ0. We therefore restrict attention to the set of strictly positive
valuesfor x, whichisinvariantunderthedynamics(3). Consideringonlystrictly
positive values for xis physically relevant, as this variable represents a level of
neural activity (rate of action potential ﬁring).
The following theorem provides suﬃcient conditions for the adaptat ion law
˙µ=f(x)−g(µ) (4)
to steerµto its bifurcation value µ0for the system (3).
Theorem 1. Letµ0∈Rand consider continuously diﬀerentiable functions f:
R>0→Randg:R→R. Assume that fis strictly decreasing, gis strictly
increasing, and g(µ0)is in the image of f. Then the nonlinear system (3)–
(4)withx∈R>0andµ∈Rhas a unique equilibrium point, which is globally
asymptotically stable (and locally exponentially stable i fdf/dxtakes only strictly
negative values and dg/dµonly strictly positive values). At equilibrium µequals
µ0.
The proof relies on a coordinate transformation which converts (3 )–(4) into
a nonlinear mass-spring-damper system. Global asymptotic stabilit y follows
readily from LaSalle’s theorem. Local exponential stability is shown b y means
of the linearization principle.
Proof.We introducenew coordinates q= ln(x)−ln(f−1(g(µ0))) andp=µ−µ0.
This transformation from ( x,µ) to (q,p) is a global C∞-diﬀeomorphism from
R>0×RtoR2. Expressed in these new coordinates (3)–(4) becomes
˙q=p, (5)
˙p=f(exp(q)f−1(g(µ0)))−g(p+µ0). (6)
The system of equations (5)–(6) has a unique equilibrium point at the origin.
This equilibrium corresponds to an equilibrium in original coordinates wh ere
µ=µ0.
First we prove that the null-solution of (5)–(6) is globally asymptotic ally
stable. We rewrite (5)–(6) as
˙q=p, (7)
˙p=−˜f(q)−˜g(p), (8)
with˜f(q) =−f(exp(q)f−1(g(µ0)))+g(µ0) and ˜g(p) =g(p+µ0)−g(µ0). Clearly
˜fand ˜gare both strictly increasing, continuously diﬀerentiable functions f rom
RtoRwhich are zero at zero. The candidate Lyapunov function
V:R2→R: (q,p)/mapsto→/integraldisplayq
0˜f(ξ)dξ+p2
2(9)
4
is twice continuously diﬀerentiable, positive deﬁnite and radially unbou nded.
Its time derivative along the solutions of (7)–(8) satisﬁes
˙V(q,p) =−p˜g(p)/braceleftBigg
<0 ifp/\e}atio\slash= 0,
= 0 ifp= 0.(10)
Since the null-solution is the only solution of (7)–(8) along which pvanishes
identically, global asymptotic stability of the origin follows from LaSalle ’s the-
orem [8, Corollary 3.2].
Next we prove that the equilibrium of (3)–(4) is locally exponentially st able
if df/dxtakes only strictly negative values and d g/dµonly strictly positive
values. Since the transformation from ( x,µ) to (q,p) is aC∞-diﬀeomorphism it
suﬃces to prove that the null-solution of (5)–(6) is locally exponent ially stable.
This followsreadilyfromthe linearizationprinciple. The linearizationof ( 5)–(6)
around the origin is given by
˙q=p, (11)
˙p=df
dx(f−1(g(µ0)))f−1(g(µ0))q−dg
dµ(µ0)p. (12)
If df/dxtakes only strictly negative values and d g/dµonly strictly positive
values then the linearization (11)–(12) is exponentially stable, as re quired.
Discussion of Theorem 1
1. A mathematically appealing adaptation law which satisﬁes the assum p-
tions of Theorem 1 for all possible values of µ0is given by
˙µ=−aln(x)−bµ (13)
witha,b >0. This adaptation law ensures convergence to the bifurcation
point for any possible value of µ0. It has the interesting property that the
coordinate transformation introduced in the proof of Theorem 1 c onverts
(3), (13) into the linearsystem
˙q=p, (14)
˙p=−aq−bp. (15)
From a biological point of view however this adaptation law is probably
not very relevant, among others because the right hand side of (1 3) is not
bounded. A bounded adaptation law which could be more relevant for
biological applications is for example
˙µ= 1/(1+x2)−1/(1+exp( −µ)). (16)
This bounded adaptation law also ensures convergence to the bifur cation
point for any possible value of µ0.

2. There is a subtle relationship between self-tuning of bifurcations and ideas
from robust control theory. This relation is made explicit by equatio n (5),
which represents an integrator and corresponds to integral act ion stud-
ied in robust control theory. Although perhaps surprising at ﬁrst sight,
this relation may be understood by regarding the constant µ0as an un-
known perturbation acting on the system. It is well-known from rob ust
control theory that (under appropriate conditions) rejecting o r tracking
an unknown, constant disturbance requires integral action. (Th is is a spe-
cial case of the internal model principle—see [17, 15] for a discussio n of
the internal model principle from a systems biology perspective). T he
present manifestation of integral action, however, diﬀers from t raditional
robust control situations because the integral action is not gene rated by
the adaptation law but is inherent to the dynamics of system (3) itse lf.
3. If an additional perturbation term εp(x,µ,t) is considered
˙x= (µ−µ0)x+εp(x,µ,t), (17)
we may conclude that the adaptation law (4) steers µapproximately to
µ0under the conditions of Theorem 1 provided the perturbation is sma ll
enough.
Theorem 2. Letµ0∈Rand consider continuously diﬀerentiable func-
tionsf:R>0→Randg:R→R. Assume that fis strictly decreas-
ing,gis strictly increasing, and g(µ0)is in the image of f. Consider a
strictly positive parameter εand a continuous function p:R>0×R2→
R: (x,µ,t)→p(x,µ,t)and assume that pis bounded in tuniformly with
respect to (x,µ)belonging to compact subsets of R>0×R. Then the unique
equilibrium point for the original system (3)–(4)is uniformly semiglobally
practically asymptotically stable for the perturbed syste m(17)–(4).
(We refer to the Appendix for a deﬁnition of uniform semiglobal prac tical
asymptotic stability.) In particular, this theorem guarantees that along
all trajectories of (17)–(4) originating in an arbitrarily large compa ct sub-
set ofR>0×R,µwill eventually converge to an arbitrarily small open
neighborhood of µ0provided εis small enough. This result is a manifesta-
tion of the well-known robustness of asymptotic stability with respe ct to
small perturbations. It provides some justiﬁcation for ignoring th e exter-
nal stimulus in equation(2) and studying the simplerequation (3) inst ead,
at least in a ﬁrst approximation.
3 A second-order system
In a series of articles [4, 5, 6, 7] it is argued that various nonlinear ph enomena
in the auditory system (such as ultrahigh sensitivity to weak signals) may be
understood in terms of the generic properties of a forced dynamic al system
6
exhibiting a Hopf bifurcation. In [6] this is illustrated by means of a sta ndard
model for nonlinear oscillations which (with the notation of the prese nt paper)
takes the form
¨x+(µ0−µ)˙x+λ˙x3+ω2x=u(t). (18)
As before µis an adjustable parameter and µ0is an unknown constant. In the
absence of an external input u, equation (18) describes damped oscillations if
µ < µ 0. Atµ=µ0the system undergoes a Hopf bifurcation and for µ > µ 0
spontaneous oscillations are being generated. Assuming that it is po ssible to
tuneµ=µ0suchamodel capturesthe biophysicalnatureofhaircelloscillation s
within the cochleawhere the hair cells are thought of as active, almost self-
oscillating systems rather than passive oscillators. In [4, 5, 6, 7] it is shown how
such a dynamical system operating at a Hopf bifurcation indeed may account
for several of the observed nonlinear phenomena in hearing. Again the question
arises as to how proximity to the bifurcation point may be ensured. I n [4, 6] it
is suggested that a feedback mechanism is responsible for this self- tuning and
numerical simulations are provided to support this claim.
Here we want to contribute to a mathematical analysis of self-tunin g of an
oscillator. In a ﬁrst approximation we ignore the cubic damping term a nd the
external input and we study the following question. Find an adaptat ion law
for the parameter µwhich does not depend on µ0and which steers µto its
bifurcation value µ0for the system
¨x+(µ0−µ)˙x+ω2x= 0. (19)
As before let us ﬁrst discuss the feasibility of this problem. It is easy to see
that ifx= ˙x= 0 at some time instant then x= ˙x= 0 for all times and in this
case it is clearly impossible to steer µtoµ0without prior knowledge of µ0. We
therefore restrict attention to the set where xand ˙xare not both zero—this set
is invariant under the dynamics (19).
The following theorem asserts that the adaptation law
˙µ=−aln(/radicalbig
x2+(˙x/ω)2)−bµ (20)
steersµto its bifurcation value µ0for the system (19) if 0 < a≤b2andb >0.
Theorem 3. Letµ0∈Randa,b,ω∈R>0. Assume that a≤b2. The nonlinear
system(19)–(20)with(x,˙x)∈R2\ {(0,0)}andµ∈Rhas a unique periodic
orbit1which is globally asymptotically stable and locally expone ntially stable. On
this periodic orbit µ=µ0.
The proof of global asymptotic stability is based on passivity techniq ues.
We interpret (19)–(20) (in a diﬀerent coordinate system) as a fee dback inter-
connection of a linear system with a dynamic feedback which satisﬁes a sector
condition. Via the Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov lemma we obtain a prope r, non-
increasing Lyapunov function. Global asymptotic stability of the pe riodic orbit
then follows from LaSalle’s invariance principle.
1A periodic orbit is a subset of the state-space which is the im age of a periodic solution.

Proof.First we introduce new coordinates randφaccording to x=rcos(φ)
and ˙x=−rωsin(φ). The transformation from ( x,˙x) to (r,φ) is a global
C∞-diﬀeomorphism from R2\ {(0,0)}toR>0×S1. Expressed in the coor-
dinates ( r,φ,µ), equations (19)–(20) become
˙r= (µ−µ0)rsin2(φ), (21)
˙φ=ω+(µ−µ0)sin(φ)cos(φ), (22)
˙µ=−aln(r)−bµ. (23)
Next we introduce new coordinates q= ln(r) +bµ0/aandp=µ−µ0. The
transformationfrom ( r,µ) to (q,p) is a global C∞-diﬀeomorphism from R>0×R
toR2. Expressed in the coordinates ( q,φ,p), equations (21)–(23) become
˙q=psin2(φ), (24)
˙φ=ω+psin(φ)cos(φ), (25)
˙p=−aq−bp. (26)
Clearly the system of equations (24)–(26) has a periodic orbit {(q,φ,p)∈R×
S1×R:q=p= 0}which we denote by A. This periodic orbit corresponds
to a periodic orbit in original coordinates where µ=µ0. It is clear from the
following paragraph that this periodic orbit is unique.
First we prove that the periodic orbit Aof (24)–(26) is globally asymptot-
ically stable. We interpret (24)–(26) as a feedback interconnectio n of a linear
control system
˙q=−u, (27)
˙p=−aq−bp, (28)
with a negative, dynamic feedback u=−sin2(φ)pwhereφsatisﬁes (25). The
transfer function H(s) of (27)–(28) from utopis given by
H(s) =a
s(s+b). (29)
Sinceaandbare strictly positive and a≤b2the transfer function H(s)+1 is
positive real. Hence by (a modiﬁed version of) the Kalman-Yakubovic h-Popov
lemma (proven in [1] and described in [8, Exercise 10.2]) there exists a p ositive
deﬁnite, quadratic Lyapunov function ( q,p)/mapsto→V(q,p) whose time derivative
along the solutions of the control system (27)–(28) satisﬁes
˙V(q,p,u)≤up+u2. (30)
In other words the control system (27)–(28) with input uand output pis input
feedforwardpassivewith a shortageofpassivity [11]. Since the fee dback satisﬁes
up+u2= (sin4(φ)−sin2(φ))p2=−(sin(φ)cos(φ)p)2, (31)
8
it follows that the time-derivative of Valong the solutions of (24)–(26) satisﬁes
˙V(q,φ,p)/braceleftBigg
<0 if sin( φ)cos(φ)p/\e}atio\slash= 0,
= 0 if sin( φ)cos(φ)p= 0.(32)
Since (q,φ,p)/mapsto→V(q,p) is positive deﬁnite with respect to the periodic orbit A
it follows that Ais stable. In addition, since ( q,φ,p)/mapsto→V(q,p) is radially
unbounded with respect to Aand since Ais compact it follows that every
solution of (24)–(26) is bounded. Finally, since Ais the largest invariant set of
(24)–(26) contained in {(q,φ,p)∈R×S1×R:˙V(q,φ,p) = 0}it follows from
LaSalle’s theorem that every solution of (24)–(26) converges to A.
It remains to be proven that the periodic orbit of (19)–(20) is locally ex-
ponentially stable. This follows directly from Theorem 4 which is stated and
proven below.
Although mathematically appealing, the adaptation law (20) is probab lynot
very relevant from a biological point of view, among others because the right
hand side is not bounded. It would therefore be interesting to have a result
available that applies to more general adaptation laws
˙µ=f(/radicalbig
x2+(˙x/ω)2)−g(µ). (33)
This is the subject of Theorem 4. Unlike the previous results, Theor em 4 is a
local stability result.
Theorem 4. Letµ0∈Rand consider continuously diﬀerentiable functions f:
R>0→Randg:R→R. Assume that g(µ0)is in the image of f. Consider
r∗∈f−1(g(µ0))and assume that 0<−(df/dr)(r∗)r∗≤((dg/dµ)(µ0))2and
(dg/dµ)(µ0)>0. Then the system of equations (19)and(33)with(x,˙x)∈
R2\{(0,0)}andµ∈Rhas a periodic orbit which is locally exponentially stable
and where µ=µ0.
Proof.We proceed along the lines of the proof of Theorem 3. First we introd uce
new coordinates randφaccording to x=rcos(φ) and ˙x=−rωsin(φ). The
transformation from ( x,˙x) to (r,φ) is a global C∞-diﬀeomorphism from R2\
{(0,0)}toR>0×S1. Expressed in the coordinates ( r,φ,µ), equations (19) and
(33) become
˙r= (µ−µ0)rsin2(φ), (34)
˙φ=ω+(µ−µ0)sin(φ)cos(φ), (35)
˙µ=f(r)−g(µ). (36)
Next we introduce new coordinates q= ln(r)−ln(r∗) andp=µ−µ0. The
transformationfrom ( r,µ) to (q,p) is a global C∞-diﬀeomorphism from R>0×R
toR2. Expressed in the coordinates ( q,φ,p), equations (34)–(36) become
˙q=psin2(φ), (37)
˙φ=ω+psin(φ)cos(φ), (38)
˙p=f(exp(q)r∗)−g(p+µ0). (39)
9
Clearly the system of equations (37)–(39) has a periodic orbit {(q,φ,p)∈R×
S1×R:q=p= 0}which we denote by A. This periodic orbit corresponds to
a periodic orbit in original coordinates where µ=µ0.
Since the transformation from ( x,˙x,µ) to (q,φ,p) is aC∞-diﬀeomorphism it
suﬃces to prove that the periodic orbit Aof (37)–(39) is locally exponentially
stable. We ﬁrst ignore the “higher order” terms in the right hand sid e of (38)
and (39) and consider the simpler system
˙q=psin2(φ), (40)
˙φ=ω, (41)
˙p=−aq−bp, (42)
wherewehaveintroducedthenotation a=−(df/dr)(r∗)r∗andb= (dg/dµ)(µ0).
By the assumptions of the theorem 0 < a≤b2andb >0. Repeating the ar-
guments of the proof of Theorem 4 it is easy to see that the set Ais a globally
asymptotically stable periodic orbit of (40)–(42). Because of the s pecial struc-
ture of equation (41) we may interpret φas a time variable and the system of
equations (40) and (42) as a periodically time-varying linear system. With this
interpretation the periodic orbit Aof (40)–(42) corresponds to the null-solution
of the linear system of equations (40) and (42). Standard conver se theorems
for periodically time-varying linear systems (see for example [8, Theo rem 3.10])
yield the existence of strictly positive real numbers c1,c2andc3and a continu-
ously diﬀerentiable Lyapunov function ( q,φ,p)/mapsto→V(q,φ,p) which is quadratic
in (q,p) and (together with its partial derivative ∂V/∂φ) bounded in φsuch
that
c1(q2+p2)≤V(q,φ,p)≤c2(q2+p2) (43)
and such that the time derivative of Valong the solutions of (40)–(42) satisﬁes
˙V(q,φ,p)≤ −c3(q2+p2). (44)
With this Lyapunov function Vwe now prove that the periodic orbit Aof (37)–
(39) is locally exponentially stable. Indeed, for qandpsuﬃciently close to zero
the time derivative of Vevaluated along the solutions of (37)–(39) satisﬁes
˙V(q,φ,p)≤ −c3
2(q2+p2) (45)
since the extra terms in the right hand side of (38) and (39) give rise to extra
terms in the Lyapunov balance which are bounded in φand of order higher
than two in ( q,p). This shows that the periodic orbit Aof (37)–(39) is locally
exponentially stable.
Discussion of Theorems 3 and 4
1. The assumptions of Theorem 4 involve the unknown critical value µ0.
Ifµ0is known to belong to some interval, it is of interest to have an
10
adaptation law which satisﬁes the assumptions of the theorem for a llµ0
in this interval. For example, it is easily veriﬁed that the adaptation law
˙µ= 1/(1+/parenleftBig/radicalbig
x2+(˙x/ω)2/parenrightBiga
)−bµ (46)
with 0< a≤4b2andb >0 satisﬁes all assumptions of the theorem if
0< µ0<1/b.
2. The proposed adaptation laws (20) and (33) depend not only on xand
µbut also on ˙ xandω. Their implementation requires that the state
variable ˙ xis measured and the parameter ωis known. This may be a
disadvantage.
3. If an additional perturbation term εp(x,˙x,µ,t) is considered
¨x+(µ0−µ)˙x+ω2x=εp(x,˙x,µ,t), (47)
we may conclude that the adaptation law (20) or (33) steers µapproxi-
mately to µ0under the conditions of Theorem 3 or Theorem 4 provided
the perturbation is small enough.
Theorem 5. Letµ0∈Rand consider continuously diﬀerentiable func-

known robustness of asymptotic (or exponential) stability with res pect to
small perturbations. It provides some justiﬁcation for ignoring th e cu-

simpler equation (19) instead, at least in a ﬁrst approximation.

A Practical and semiglobal stability deﬁnitions
Let Ω be an open subset of Rn(n∈N) and consider a family of continuous
functions fε:R×Ω→Rn, labeled by a parameter ε >0. We are interested in
the stability properties of the family of diﬀerential equations
˙x=fε(t,x) (48)
forsmall valuesof ε. LetAbe acompactsubset ofΩ, which need not necessarily
be forward invariant for (48).
Deﬁnition 1. For the family of diﬀerential equations (48), the set Ais:
1. Uniformly practically stable if for every open neighborh oodU2ofAthere
isε∗>0and an open neighborhood U1ofAsuch that for all ε∈(0, ε∗]
every solution ξof(48)satisﬁes: if ξ(t0)∈U1for some t0in the domain
ofξ, thenξ(t)∈U2for allt≥t0in the domain of ξ.
2. Uniformly practically asymptotically stable if it is uni formly practically
stable and, in addition, there is an open neighborhood U1ofAsuch that
for every open neighborhood U2ofAthere is T≥0andε∗>0such
that for all ε∈(0, ε∗]every solution ξof(48)satisﬁes: if ξ(t0)∈U1for
somet0in the domain of ξ, thenξ(t)∈U2for allt≥t0+Tin the domain
ofξ.
3. Uniformly semiglobally bounded if for every compact subs etK1ofΩthere
isε∗>0and a compact subset K2ofΩsuch that for all ε∈(0, ε∗]every
solution ξof(48)satisﬁes: if ξ(t0)∈K1for some t0in the domain of ξ,
thenξ(t)∈K2for allt≥t0in the domain of ξ.
4. Uniformly semiglobally practically asymptotically sta ble if it is uniformly
practically stable and uniformly semiglobally bounded and , in addition, for
every compact subset KofΩand every open neighborhood UofAthere
isT≥0andε∗>0such that for all ε∈(0, ε∗]every solution ξof(48)
satisﬁes: if ξ(t0)∈Kfor some t0in the domain of ξ, thenξ(t)∈Ufor
allt≥t0+Tin the domain of ξ.
