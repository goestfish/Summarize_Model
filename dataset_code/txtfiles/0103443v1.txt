Abstract
Evolutionary dynamicsinan uncorrelated ruggedﬁtnesslan dscape
is studied in the framework of Eigen’s molecular quasispeci es model.
We consider the case of strong selection, which is analogous to the
zero temperature limit in the equivalent problem of directe d polymers
in random media. In this limit the population is always local ized at a
single temporary master sequence σ∗(t), and we study the statistical
properties of the evolutionary trajectory which σ∗(t) traces out in se-
quencespace. Numerical resultsforbinarysequences oflen gthN= 10
and exponential and uniform ﬁtness distributions are prese nted. Evo-
lution proceeds by intermittent jumps between local ﬁtness maxima,
where high lying maxima are visited more frequently by the tr ajec-
tories. The probability distribution for the total time Trequired to
reach the global maximum shows a T−2-tail, which is argued to be
universal and to derive from near-degenerate ﬁtness maxima . The to-
tal number of jumps along any given trajectory is always smal l, much
smaller than predicted by the statistics of records for rand om long-
ranged evolutionary jumps.

“The concept of quasispecies is not just a model that involves any odd assumption;
it shows how to view the darwinian world of replicating and mu tating species from
a physical viewpoint.” M. Eigen [1]
1 Introduction and motivation
Eigen’s quasispecies theory of molecular evolution is the simplest math e-
matical model that incorporates the central Darwinian paradigm o f natural
selection acting on variability created by random mutations. The mod el was
originally developed to understand the conditions for the maintenan ce of in-
formation in systems of self-instructive replicating macromolecules [2]. Such
systems can be realized in the laboratory in the form of populations o f RNA
strands which replicate in vitroin the presence of RNA replicase, display-
ing a wide range of evolutionary phenomena [3, 4, 5, 6]. The notion of a
quasispecies [7] refers to the structure of self-replicating populations, which
typically consist of a distribution of related mutants centered arou nd a most
abundant mastergenotype (see below). The quasispecies structure plays an
important role in the evolution of RNA viruses, where the presence o f a wide
range of mutants allows the virus to adapt rapidly to environmental changes
[8,9]. Ontheotherhand, theexistence ofanerrorthresholdbeyo ndwhichno
localized quasispecies can be maintained (see Eq.(4)) places an upper bound
on the genome length of RNA viruses [10].
The mathematical structure of the quasispecies model has made it a fa-
vored entrance way for statistical physicists into the ﬁeld of biolog ical evo-
lution1. It was ﬁrst observed by Leuth¨ ausser [14] that the discrete tim e dy-
namics (3) can be interpreted as a transfer matrix of a two-dimens ional Ising
model, where the genotype sequences become one-dimensional sp in conﬁgu-
rations that are coupled in the time direction through the mutation m atrix
(1) [15]. A similar relation can be established between (3) and the tran s-
fer matrix of a polymer directed along the time axis [16, 17]. In addition ,
Baake and coworkers have recently exploited the equivalence betw een quan-
tum spin chains and a class of kinetic evolution equations closely relate d to
the quasispecies model, in which mutation and selection occur in paralle l
[12, 18].
In its most basic version, the quasispecies model is formulated in ter ms

of standard chemical reaction equations2written for the concentrations nσ(t)
of sequences σ= (σ1,...,σN), each of which is composed of Nsymbols drawn
from an alphabet of Kletters; the usual choice is a binary alphabet ( K= 2),
so thatσitakes the values 0 and 1. The resulting sequence space consists
then ofS= 2Npoints arranged on the vertices of an N-dimensional hyper-
cube. Each sequence σreproduces at a rate W(σ), which may be taken as
a measure of its ﬁtness [11]. In the reproduction process errors o ccur with
a mutation probability µper site. The probability of creating a sequence σ′
when attempting to copy sequence σis therefore equal to
Qµ(σ→σ′) =µdH(σ,σ′)(1−µ)N−dH(σ,σ′)(1)
where
dH(σ,σ′) =N/summationdisplay
i=1(σi−σ′
i)2(2)
is the Hamming distance between the two sequences, i.e. the number of
digits in which the two diﬀer. The dynamical evolution in discrete time is
then given by
nσ(t+1) =/summationdisplay
σ′W(σ′)Qµ(σ′→σ)nσ′(t). (3)
Introducing the constraint of a ﬁxed number of molecules leads to n onlinear
loss terms on the right hand side of (3) [7]. However since these can g enerally
be transformed away, we ignore this complication here, at the expe nse of
dealing with exponentially growing population numbers.
The linear form of the evolution equation (3) makes it plain that, for lo ng
times, the concentrations will approach that eigenvector of the e volution ma-
trixW(σ)Qµ(σ→σ′) which corresponds to the largest eigenvalue. Provided
this eigenvector is localized in sequence space, it deﬁnes the quasispecies: A
distribution of related mutants centered around the master sequ ence, which
usually is the sequence with the maximum replication rate W(σ). The most
celebrated property of the model is its prediction of a sharp error threshold ,
where the quasispecies delocalizes, and the population spreads unif ormly
over sequence space. In terms of the sequence length Nand the mutation
probability µ, the condition for a localized quasispecies takes the form [2, 7]

whereAdenotes the selective advantage , a measure for the superiority of
the master sequence compared to the other sequences. For the simplest case
of a single peak ﬁtness landscape, where the master sequence rep licates at
rateW0and all other sequences replicate at rate W1< W0, the selective
advantage is A=W0/W1, while for randomly distributed replication rates
it is a functional of the rate distribution [19, 20]. In terms of the phy sical
analogies described above, the error threshold phenomenon is equ ivalent to
the thermal phase transition in the Ising model [14, 15, 18, 20, 21] and to the
thermal unbinding of a directed polymer bound to an attractive colu mnar
defect along the time direction [16, 17].
Much less appears to be known about the evolutionary dynamics of t he
model, that is, the approach to the ﬁnal quasispecies distribution f rom an
initiallocalizedordelocalized state. ItwasﬁrstpointedoutbyMcCas kill [19,
22] that this dynamics should take the form of a “slowing optimization walk”
throughasuccession ofmetastable states which correspond, ins ome sense, to
local maxima in the ﬁtness landscape. The separation of time scales b etween
the (long) residence time ina metastable state and the (brief) tran sition time
to the next maximum implies a punctuated pattern of evolution [23, 24, 25],
which can be analyzed in analogy to variable range hopping in condense d
matter physics [26, 27, 28].
We should concede from the outset that the deterministic rate equ ations
(3) are not an entirely appropriate description for this evolutionar y regime,
since the transition between two local maxima proceeds through th e tails
of the localized, metastable quasispecies, where the population num bers are
small and ﬂuctuations due to the ﬁnite number of molecules cannot b e ig-
nored [22, 28, 29]. It seemed nevertheless worthwhile to explore th ese ques-
tions within the most basic, deterministic model, before turning to mo re
sophisticated approaches.
The present paper reports on some preliminary results from such a n in-
vestigation. To avoid the complications due to a ﬁnite error thresho ld, we
consider a strong selection limit (to be described in the next section) , in
which the population is localized at a single site in sequence space at all
times. This allows a direct comparison with simple schematic models of
evolutionary dynamics, such as adaptive walks [30, 31, 32, 33] and r ecord
dynamics [34, 35, 36]. Adaptive walks describe the evolution of a gene tically
homogeneous population under the assumption that deleterious mu tations
(which decrease the ﬁtness) are eliminated, while advantageous mu tations
spread instantaneously. The population then performs an uphill wa lk in
4
the ﬁtness landscape, which terminates at a local maximum where no ﬁt-
ter one-step neighbors are available. In contrast, in the quasispe cies model
the population evolves through a chain of local ﬁtness maxima which p ro-
gresses all the way to the globaloptimum. Some qualitative properties of
theseevolutionary trajectories are described in Section 3, while Section 4 fo-
cuses on a speciﬁc statistical feature, the total evolution time. A comparison
with record dynamics is provided in Section 5, and some open question s are
formulated in Section 6.

monotonic increase in sequence number for the exponential distrib ution is
fortuitous - there is no correspondence between the position of a sequence on

Throughout the paper we will consider maximally rugged ﬁtness land-
scapes, in which the reproduction rate W(σ) is chosen independently and
randomly for each sequence. In contrast to simpler permutation in variant
landscapes [12], this makes it necessary to store all 2Nsequences during the
iteration of the evolution equations3, restricting our numerical treatment to

analysis of the dependence on sequence length will be presented els ewhere

2 The strong selection limit
The form of the strong selection limit is motivated by the analogy with
the zero temperature limit in the associated problems of statistical physics.
FollowingPeliti[11,21]weintroduceaninverse“selectivetemperatu re”k >0
by writing the reproduction rates in the form
W(σ) =ekF(σ). (5)
We want to take the strong selection limit k→ ∞in such a way that only a
few mutations occur in each time step. This requires to scale the mut ation
rate as
µ=e−kγ(6)
whereγ >0 is a constant. Inserting (5) and (6) into (3) it is clear that the
sequence concentrations will grow for large kas
nσ(t) =ekE(σ,t). (7)
In the limit k→ ∞the evolution equation (3) then reduces to the recursion
E(σ,t+1) = max
σ′[E(σ′,t)+F(σ′)−γdH(σ,σ′)]. (8)
Since the term −γdHsuppresses mutations to far away sequences, we expect
similar behavior for a model in which only nearest neighbor mutations a re
allowed,
E(σ,t+1) = max
dH(σ,σ′)≤1[E(σ′,t)+F(σ′)−γdH(σ,σ′)]. (9)
All results shown in this paper were obtained using the nearest neigh bor rule
(9), with the parameter γset to unity4.
We still need to specify the probability distribution p(F) of the ﬁtnesses
F(σ). Two choices will be considered: The exponential distribution p(F) =
e−F,F≥0, and a uniform distribution on the interval [0 ,S], whereS= 2N.
The reason for this particular scaling of the width of the uniform dist ribution
will become clear below in Section 4.

3 Evolutionary trajectories
It is evident from (7) that, in the strong selection limit k→ ∞, the entire
population resides at the global maximum of the function E(σ,t). The po-
sition of this maximum in sequence space will be referred to as the mas ter
sequence at time t, and denoted by σ∗(t). At time t= 0 the master se-
quence is placed at a randomly chosen point σ(i)by setting E(σ(i),t) = 0 and
E(σ,t) =−∞forσ/negationslash=σ(i). The subsequent time evolution σ∗(t) deﬁnes an
evolutionary trajectory.
Inspection shows that, after one or two time steps, such a traje ctory
passes exclusively through local ﬁtness maxima, and eventually, af ter a total
evolution time T, it invariably reaches the global ﬁtness maximum. During
the evolution, the master sequence spends increasingly long time int ervals
at local maxima of increasing ﬁtness, with a few abrupt transitions in be-
tween (Figure 1). The number of transitions is small (see Figure 5), much
smaller than the number of local ﬁtness maxima, which is on average e qual
to 2N/(N+1)≈93 [30]. This implies that most local maxima are bypassed
by a typical trajectory.

ﬁtness landscape with exponential ﬁtness distribution p(F). The particular
landscape used here is near degenerate (gap size ǫ≈0.02)
7
A quantiﬁcation of this statement is shown in Figure 2, in which the ﬁt-
nessFof local maxima is plotted against the number of times it is visited
by an evolutionary trajectory. These data were generated by go ing through
all possible starting points σ(i)in a ﬁxed ﬁtness landscape. The ﬁgure shows
a roughly linear correlation between the ﬁtness of a maximum and the loga-
rithm of the number of visits.
In relation to adaptive walks [30, 31, 32, 33], which respond only to th e
relative ordering of ﬁtnesses and not to their actual values, it is of inter-
est to ask to what extent the set of maxima visited by a given trajec tory
is determined by the ordering of ﬁtnesses. For this reason Figure 1 shows
two trajectories evolving in landscapes which were generated using the same
random numbers – thus having identical ordering of ﬁtnesses – but with dif-
ferent ﬁtness distributions. Itcanbeseen thattheset oflocal m axima visited
by the two trajectories is almost identical, apart from a small detou r taken
by the “uniform” trajectory, but the timing of the evolutionary tr ansitions is
markedly diﬀerent in the two cases. With reference to G.G. Simpson’s classic
treatise [23], we may say that the ﬁtness distribution aﬀects only th etempo,
but not the modeof quasispecies evolution. For a quantitative analysis of
the temporal aspects we next turn to the distribution of evolution times.
4 Distribution of evolution times
Figure 3 shows the distribution P(T) of the number of time steps Trequired
to reach the global ﬁtness maximum, obtained by averaging over 50 0000
landscapes with exponential and uniform ﬁtness distributions. The time
distribution for the exponential case displays a distinct maximum aro und
T= 7, followed by a slowly decaying tail which is well described by the
power law
P(T)∼T−2(10)
over roughly two decades. The distribution for the uniform case is m uch
broader, but a similar power law tail can be seen for times T≥500.
The power law (10) appears to be a simple consequence of the order
statistics of uncorrelated ﬁtness landscapes. Let F(1)> F(2)> ... > F(S)be
a realization of ﬁtnesses arranged in decreasing order. As a measu re of the
spread in ﬁtnesses among the most ﬁt sequences we introduce the ﬁtness gap
ǫ=F(1)−F(2)>0, (11)

stage of evolution the population will typically make a a transition from the
second best sequence σ(2)(or some local ﬁtness maximum with comparable
ﬁtness5) to the globally optimal sequence σ(1). From the evolution rule (9) it
is easy to see that, for small ǫ, this transition will require a time of the order
of
T≈a(N)/ǫ, (12)
where the coeﬃcient ais determined by the early stages of the evolution
process [38]. Thus given the gapdistribution Pg(ǫ) the tail of the distribution
of evolution times can be estimated to be
P(T)≈aT−2Pg(a/T), (13)
and aT−2power law follows for T≫a, provided that 0 < Pg(0)<∞. The
gap distribution is given by Pg(ǫ) =e−ǫbothfor exponentially distributed

ﬁtnesses, and for ﬁtnesses distributed uniformly between 0 and S, whenSis
large [39]. The striking diﬀerence between the two evolution time distr ibu-
tions seen in Figure 3 is related to the diﬀerent scaling of the coeﬃcien ta(N)
in (12) with sequence length: In the exponential case a(N)∼N3/2, while in
the uniform case a(N)∼√
NS[38].
To compute Pg(0) for general ﬁtness distributions, noteﬁrst that the joint
distribution of F(1)andF(2)is given by [40]
P2(F(1),F(2)) =S(S−1)pc(F(2))S−2p(F(1))p(F(2)) (14)
wherepc(F) =/integraltextF
0dF′p(F′) denotes the cumulative ﬁtness distribution. The
cumulative gap distribution is obtained by integration,

which tends to Pg(0)ǫforǫ→0. Thus we conclude that
Pg(0) =S(S−1)/integraldisplay∞
0dFp(F)2pc(F)S−2(16)
which is clearly ﬁnite and nonzero.
The relationship (13) implies that the near-degenerate ﬁtness land scapes,
which have very small gaps, are the ones that give rise to anomalous ly long
evolution times. Figure 4 illustrates this connection. The data shown as
crosses were obtained from an average over exponential ﬁtness landscapes,
for which the ﬁtness gap ǫwas increased artiﬁcially by increasing the global
ﬁtness maximum according to F(1)→F(1)+1. This is seen to immediately
remove the power law tail (10).
5 Comparison to record dynamics
A simple schematic analogue of the nonstationary (ever slowing) evo lution
process found in the quasispecies model is provided by the dynamics of
records [34, 35, 36, 39], which is equivalent to evolution by long-rang ed ran-
dom mutations known in the classical literature as the theory of “ho peful
monsters” [23, 30]. In the present context it reduces to the follow ing rule
for the motion of the master sequence σ∗(t) in sequence space: At each time

Figure 4: Comparison of the distribution of evolution times for expon entially
distributed ﬁtnesses (+) with an ensemble of landscapes for which n ear-
degeneracies (small gaps) have been removed ( ×). The latter data were
averaged over 50000 realizations
step, the population attempts a jump to another, randomly chose n sequence
σ′/negationslash=σ∗(t). The move is accepted, and σ∗(t+1) =σ′, ifF(σ′)> F(σ∗(t));
otherwise it is discarded and σ∗(t+ 1) =σ∗(t). Thus the current sequence
σ∗(t) represents the ﬁtness record among the sequences which the population
has encountered so far.
Clearly this process gives rise to a step-like, punctuated pattern w hich is
qualitatively similar to that shown above in Figure 1. Here we are concerned
with aquantitative comparison of statistical properties. Let us ﬁrst com-
pute the probability distribution of the total evolution time Tfor the record
dynamics. Since the probability of ﬁnding the global ﬁtness maximum in
any jump is 1 /S, the probability that it has not been found up to time tis
(1−1/S)t≈e−t/Sfor large Sandt. Taking the derivative one obtains
P(T) =S−1e−T/S. (17)
Thetypical evolutiontimes areoftheorderofthenumber ofseque nces, much
larger than in the quasipecies model. This demonstrates impressively the
“guided” nature of quasispecies evolution [7], which is much more eﬃcie nt

distribution (18) predicted by record dynamics
than a random search. Figure 3 shows how broad the distribution (1 7) is
compared to that of the quasispecies model. Note, however, that for very
long times (longer than S) Eq.(17) decays exponentially, faster than the
degeneracy-induced power law (10). Taken literally, Eq.(10) implies t hat the
mean evolution time is inﬁnite.
Nextweconsider thedistribution Pnofthetotalnumber nofevolutionary
jumps which occur on the way to the global ﬁtness maximum. Adaptin g the
results of Sibani and collaborators [36, 37], for the case of record dynamics
we ﬁnd that Pnis a Poisson distribution with parameter ln S,
Pn≈S−1(lnS)n−1
(n−1)!. (18)
In Figure 5 this is compared to numerical data obtained for the quas ispecies
model. Again the distributions for the quasispecies dynamics are muc h nar-
rower, showing that less transitions are required to reach the glob al max-
imum. Simulations for longer sequences show that the mean number o f
12
transitions increases sublinearly in N, more slowly than the linear behav-
ior predicted by (18) [38, 41].
6 Outlook
The simplicity of the strong selection dynamics (8,9) suggests to use it for a
dynamical characterization of diﬀerent kinds of ﬁtness landscape s. In con-
trast to the random landscapes considered here, realistic ﬁtness landscapes
obtained e.g. from RNA folding contain extended neutral networks in se-
quence space, in which the ﬁtness (deﬁned in terms of the RNA seco ndary
structure) does not change [42]. Central concepts of quasispec ies theory have
been extended to such landscapes [43]. Extended neutrality provid es a dis-
tinct mechanism for the appearance of punctuation patterns in ev olution,
since changes in the genotype do not show up in the phenotype, as lo ng as
the former moves within a neutral network [44].
Another interesting direction for further research inspired by th e analogy
with directed polymers is to include eﬀects of environmental ﬂuctua tions,
which amounts to making the ﬁtness landscape time-dependent [45]. In the
directed polymer analogy, the issue is the interplay between columnar disor-
der, which is provided by the time-independent part of the landscap e, and
pointdisorder modeling the time-dependent variations [46]. It is well known
that point disorder can depin a polymer from an attractive columnar defect
in much the same way as thermal ﬂuctuations [47]. This suggests the in-
triguing possibility of an error threshold delocalization phenomenon in duced
by environmental ﬂuctuations.
