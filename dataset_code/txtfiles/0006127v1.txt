Abstract
A sharp TH1/TH2 dichotomy has often been used to deﬁne the
eﬀects of cytokines on autoimmune diseases. However contrad ictory
resultsin recent research indicate that thesituation may b emorecom-
plex. We build here a simple mathematical model aimed at sett ling
the contradictions. The model is based on a neural network pa radigm,
and is applied using Partial Diﬀerential Equations (PDE). We show
here that a TH1/TH2 paradigm is only an external view of a comp lex
multivariate system.

1 Introduction
Immunologists generally agree that in the course of many autoimmun e dis-
eases, TH1 type cells have a damaging eﬀect, whereas TH2 type cells have
a beneﬁcial eﬀect [1]. Thus the disease is aggravated by a high ratio o f
TH1/TH2 T cells and cytokines. This view is contradicted by many expe r-
imental results showing an inverse eﬀect [2]: TH2 type cells may enhan ce
disease, if administrated at a certain time [3], and TH1 type cells can st op
the evolution of the disease, if given at the appropriate time [4, 5]. Ot her
works show that gene knock-out mice with no INF γor TNFαstill man-
age to produce the pathological features of a TH1-dependent au toimmune
disease [6, 7]. Based on results from EAE (experimental autoimmune en-
cephalomyelitis) [8] and insulin dependent diabetes melitus (IDDM) [9, 1 0]
in Non Obese Diabetic (NOD) mice [11], we propose a larger model explain -
ing both the general agreement and the contradictory results. W e suggest
that the TH1 and TH2 cells are not the cause of the disease, but a ma rker
for a more general steady state. To settle the contradictions, w e use a nu-
merical model and general mechanisms of safe information transm ission [12]
to explain the discrepancy in the case of gene knock-out mice. We sh ow the
explanatory power of our model andits ability to produce theknown features
of TH1 type diseases.
2 Model
Our model is based on a neural network paradigm [13], where the ove rall
situation is not described by the properties of any one cell type, bu t by
the steady state of the network. We use PDE in order to get a cont inuous
description of the network. Each cell in the network represents a class of cells
withthesamegeneralproperties, atleastfromthemostrelevant aspectofthe
TH1/TH2 dichotomy. The model is an ad hoc description of the dynam ics,
but most of the links we use have some experimental backing. We built the
model with the smallest number of cell types needed to explain qualita tively
the experimental results.

2.1 Experimental results
EAE is an autoimmune disease studied mainly in rats and in mice, and is
used as a model for human multiple sclerosis [14, 15] . In EAE, myelin in t he
CNS becomes inﬂamed inducing paralysis and even death [16]. This disea se
is classically deﬁned by a TH1/TH2 dichotomy in which TH1 T cells induce
the disease whereas TH2 cells prevent it [1].
Classical EAE experiments show that:
•EAE can be induced either by adoptive transfer of CD4 T cells from a
sick rodent, or by active immunization by an injection of a myelin anti-
gen in adjuvant to a healthy rodent [17]. We will show that these two
procedures lead, in fact, to two separate pathways of disease ind uction.
•Administration of free antigen arrests EAE [18]. We propose to show
that antigen-induced inhibition could be due to the eﬀect of regulato ry
anti-idiotypic (anti-id) suppressor cells.
•The disease can be prevented by the continuous administration of I L-4,
which is a TH2 type cytokine thought to push the immune system into
a healthy TH2 dominated state REF FROM EAE[19]. But IL-4 can
also aggravate disease (see below).
However, recentresearchresultsappeartocontradicttheclas sicalTH1/TH2
hypothesis:
•A small amount of IL-4 administrated during disease induction can
block the suppressive eﬀect of free antigen.[20] This paradox will be
explained by the eﬀect of TH2 type cytokines on anti-id regulatory
cells.
•A short administration of a TH1 cytokine can heal the disease [4, 5].
This eﬀect too can be attributed to an anti-id regulatory cell.
•Gene knock-out mice, lacking one or some of the TH1 cytokines, can
still develop EAE or IDDM [6, 7]. This paradox will be explained by
the nature of regulation.
These facts regarding EAE are combined in our analysis with results
regardingthestructureofid-anti-idcell interactions andthecyt okine proﬁle
expressed during the evolution of IDDM in NOD mice [9, 10] , and in the
mouse model of EAE [8, 21].

2.2 Cells and Cytokine Types
Ourmodel iscomposedofﬁvecelltypes, threecytokinetypesand theantigen
(Table 1). The ﬁrst cell type is the naive CD4 T cell that can diﬀerent iate
into the second and third cell types: TH1 and TH2 type CD4 T cells [22].
Theanti-idcellsaregroupedasasinglecelltype, thefourthcelltyp e. Amore
detailedmodel shouldusenaive anti-idcells anddiverse anti-idcells sec reting
TH1 type cytokines and TH2 type cytokines. For the sake of simplicit y,
however, we group all anti-id cells into one cell type, and assume the y have
thesameeﬀect. SinceweknowfromIDDMandEAEthatanti-idcellsse crete
more TH1 cytokines than TH2 [10, 8] , we designate the anti-id popula tion
as TH1 type cells. The CD4 T id cells can present themselves directly to
the anti-id cells [10]. The ﬁfth type of cells are macrophages, which pla y
additional roles as APC [23] and as cytokine-secreting cells. The ant igen
represents the quantity of antigen presented to the CD4 T cells. W e assume
that there is a large enough number of APCs so that the CD4 T cells ca n
see the antigen.
The three types of cytokines are:
•TH1 type cytokines that enhance the diﬀerentiation of naive cells int o
TH1 type cells.
•TH2 type cytokines that enhance the development of TH2 type cells .
•Cytokines secreted by macrophages that enhance the proliferat ion and
diﬀerentiation of TH1 cells [24]. We shall ignore the eﬀect of TH2 type
cytokines secreted by macrophages (like IL-10) and the eﬀects o f B
cells. We will group together all the macrophage-derived cytokines as
type C cytokines.
2.3 Model equations.
We compute the time derivatives of each cell type concentration xiand of
the cytokine concentration yi, assuming both are aﬀected by all other cells
and cytokines.

Table 1: Cell types and cytokines. The cytokines are labeled accord ing to
the cell type producing them. We grouped cells as follows: TH1 id cells c an
include all types of lymphocytes producing TH1 cytokines. Anti-id ce lls are
all cell types speciﬁcally reactive to the id cells. They can either be cy totoxic
cells, or limit the proliferation rate of the id cells.
xoriginiis the origin of the cell number i (for example, the TH1 cells
originate in the naive cells, the naive cells originate in themselves). The
other cells and cytokines can either induce or inhibit the proliferation of this
(xi) cell type. The cytokines originate from the cells that secrete the m, so
that the right side of eq’ 2 is not multiplied by the cytokine concentra tion.
The secretion rate of the cytokines ( yi) by cells ( xj) is linear to the other
cell and cytokine concentrations. For example, if TH2 type cytokin es inhibit
the production of TH1 cytokines, then we use a term in the equation for the
TH1 cytokines −w2ijx(th2), and we do not multiply the term by the TH1
cytokine concentration.
A cell’s proliferation rate cannot be negative. Thus we deﬁne the pro lif-
eration rate of any cell to be greater than 0. But of course, the n atural death
rate (−dixi) can lead to a decrease in the cell concentration. T he cytokine
production rate ( y′
i) is assumed not to depend on the cytokine concentration,
but on the number of cells secreting the cytokine. The equations ar e solved
numerically using a second order precision scheme [25].
We start every computation at a steady state
x′
i= 0,y′
i= 0 (3)
Since the time constants in this process are short, we could assume that
the system had already reached a steady state before the appea rance of the
autoimmune disease.

Macrophages do not reproduce during the response to the antige n but,
rather,areattractedtotheaﬀectedregion[26],sothat,likethe cytokines,their
growth rate is not multiplied by their own concentration.
Thediﬀerencesbetweenpossiblemodelsareintheassignedweights wij,w1ij
andw2ijin eq’ 1 and 2. But we have tried to use the most uniform deﬁnition
of weights, and all the weights are of the same order of magnitude. If we had
no special reason to believe that two weights of the same type were diﬀerent,
we ﬁxed them at the same value (the eﬀect of TH1 cells on TH1 cytokin es
and the eﬀect of TH2 cells on TH2 cytokines, for example). This was d one
in order to limit the size of the parameter space.
2.4 Model description
The structure of the model is simply a mathematical description of t he ﬁnd-
ingsinIDDMandEAE.Thebasicpartofthemodelistheoppositionbet ween
id cells and anti-id cells. The CD4 are the id cells and the naive CD4 popula-
tionproliferatesproportionallytotheantigenconcentration. The suppressors
are the anti-id cells, and they proliferate proportionally to the conc entration
of id cells (Figure 1A).
The second division of this model is into TH1 and TH2 id cells. Both
the TH1 and TH2 cells originate from the naive id cell. The TH1 cell type is
associated with a TH1 cytokine type andthe TH2 cell type is associat ed with
a TH2 cytokine type. We assume that each cell enhances its own cyt okine
type [27] and inhibits the production of the opposing type. Each cyt okine
encourages the production of the appropriate cell type and inhibit s the other
type (Figure 1B).
The macrophages have a double eﬀect: They serve as APCs and act ivate
naive CD4 cells [23], and they secrete cytokines that enhance T cell d iﬀeren-
tiation into TH1 type cells [28] (and inhibit diﬀerentiation into TH2 cells).
The macrophages are inﬂuenced by the TH1 cytokines, which activa te them
to migrate into the inﬂammatory site. Since macrophages respond t o TH1
cytokine and are inhibited by TH2 cytokines, changes in the macroph age
concentration depend on the diﬀerences between the concentra tions of TH1
and TH2 cytokine types.
The anti-id cells are of a TH1 type. This assumption is based on data
from EAE and IDDM [10, 8]. We thus postulate that the anti-id cells are
inhibited by TH2 type cytokines. And ﬁnally, we assume that there is a basic
concentration and diﬀerentiation rate of CD4 cells into TH1 and TH2; but

2.5 Model mechanism
We have two basic steady states (Figure 3), and all the cells and cyt okines
administrated only move the model from one steady state to the ot her, and
back. The basic situation is a TH2 type steady state, which is assume d
to be healthy, whereas the TH1 steady state leads to autoimmune d isease.
In contrast to the general view, the TH2 steady state represen ts a global
situation of the system, and not the concentration of a single cell o r cytokine.
Note that the absence of disease does not mean that the system is at rest; the

Figure 2: Flow chart of the model. The model is based on a TH1/TH2
balance. If the TH1 concentration is too high the target organ is at tacked. If
there is a high TH2 concentration, the target organ remains health y. Dotted
lines indicate inhibition; full lines indicate stimulation. There is also an
inhibition of TH2 on the production of TH1 and vice versa, but these lin es

TH2 steady state is associated with relatively low concentrations of reacting
cells. Nevertheless the id and ant-id cells are still reacting at the sam e rate,
but at a lower concentration. In other words the healthy state me rely looks
like it is at rest; on the contrary health like disease is a state of intera ctions
[29].
When we administer cells or antigen and adjuvant, we push the syste m
toward the TH1 state (Figure 4). Following administration of T cells, w hich
are primarily TH1 type cells, the number of TH1 cells is high enough to
start the production of TH1 cytokines that inhibit the TH2 cytokine s. The
system then falls into the TH1 steady state, which is the diseased st ate.
Another way to induce disease is to immunize the animal with antigen an d
adjuvant. We propose that the adjuvant stimulates macrophage s to produce
C type cytokines. The antigen together with the cytokines induces CD4 T
cell proliferationanddiﬀerentiation into TH1 cells, bringing thesyste m again
to a TH1 type steady state.
One way to heal the disease is to administer free antigen (Figure 5) in
an amount that can raise the total number of naive CD4 cells that be come
TH1 CD4 cells. The resulting high concentration of CD4 cells will activat e
an increase in the number of anti-id cells. At this point, we assume tha t the
lifespan of the anti-id cells is longer than that of the CD4 cells; the num ber of
anti-id cells will remain high even after the number of CD4 id cells decrea ses
(due to the fall in antigenic stimulation). Once the total number of C D4 cells
is below a certain threshold, the system returns by itself to the hea lthy TH2
situation.The basic situation is the TH2 situation.
The return to a TH2 state, following antigen administration, can be p ara-
doxically inhibited by the administration of IL-4 with the antigen (Figur e 6).
The reason is as follows: When we administer IL-4 (which is represent ed
by type B cytokines), we inhibit the production of anti-id cells. In the ab-
sence of a suﬃcient number of anti-id cells, the number of CD4 eﬀect ors cells
remains above the threshold and the system stays in a TH1 state. I f, how-
ever, the quantity of IL-4 is high enough to overcome TH1 dominanc e and
starts activating TH2 T cells directly, then the TH1 cell concentrat ion will
decrease due to the production of TH2 cytokines by the newly form ed TH2
cells, despite the low number of anti-id cells.
The administration of anti-IL-4 antibody with the antigen can parad oxi-
cally act in a manner similar to the administration of IL-4 with the antige n.
Note that in both cases the inhibition of disease is weaker than the eﬀ ect of
administrating free antigen. The administration of anti-IL-4 antibo dy has

no eﬀect on the system at ﬁrst, since the concentration of IL-4 is low. The
eﬀect of the antigen is then as described at the beginning of the sec tion; the
antigen induces a sharp rise in the concentration of id CD4 cells, and f ollow-
ing the id CD4 cells, the anti-id cell concentration raises. These anti- id cells
produce a long term decrease in the concentration of the CD4 id cells . At
a later stage, when the concentration of CD4 id cells has decreased to a low
level, the eﬀect of the anti-IL-4 antibody becomes important. The level of
id CD4 TH1 type cells at this stage is low, and the system should now sta rt
to produce TH2 type cells and cytokines. However the anti-IL-4 an tibody
now inhibits the production of IL-4, and the system has a lower prob ability
to return to a TH2 state.
Just as the administration of TH2 cytokines can inhibit the transition
back to a TH2 state, the administration of TH1 cytokines can rise th e prob-
ability of such a transition. The continuous administration of TH1 cyt okines
will of course keep the cytokines in the TH1 proﬁle and induce or enha nce
the disease. Administration of the TH1 cytokines at the onset of th e disease
(Figure 7) will lead to an increase in the production rate of TH1 id CD4
cells; the high concentration of TH1 cells will raise the concentration of the
anti-id cells, which will later feed back to decrease the concentratio n of CD4
id cells. If the CD4 id cell concentration decreases to a low level, the s ys-
tem will return to its natural steady state, which is a TH2 steady st ate, as
described above.
The administration of some cytokines has been shown to have no obs erv-
able eﬀect on the system. This does not mean that these cytokines have no
important role in the dynamics of this system. In fact the lack of an o bserv-
able eﬀect can be due to a high endogenous concentration of the cy tokines;
adding additional amounts cannot enhance the eﬀect.
Administration of a cytokine may have no eﬀect if the cytokine conce n-
tration is close to, or above its threshold for causing an eﬀect. For example,
administration of IL-12 at the onset of disease may have no eﬀect if the IL-12
eﬀect is already at its maximum. Paradoxically in this case, the administ ra-
tion of a low dose of anti-IL-12 antibody will also have no eﬀect, since the
precise concentration of the molecule is not important. A large chan ge in the
concentration of the molecule leads to a small change in its eﬀects. T his can
be understood if the eﬀect is bell shaped as a function of the conce ntration.
At low concentrations, a small change in the concentration leads to a large
change in the function value. However at the top of the bell, a large c hange
in the concentration leads to very small change in the function value .

2.6 Redundancy and gene knock-out mice
Gene knock-out mice lacking some of the TH1 cytokines can still deve lop
a TH1-dependent disease. However this does not contradict the m odel we
presented, which describes the evolution of the disease as the tra nsition to
a TH1 type cytokine proﬁle. The cytokines in this model are describe d
as a group with the same approximate action. Even if such a group lac ks
one of its components, the eﬀect of the group as a whole is not alter ed.
The TH1/TH2 phenotype does not depend on a single cytokine, since the
concentration of each one of the TH1 and TH2 cytokines can chang e by a
large number of mechanisms. The immune system cannot aﬀord to ch ange
its general phenotype each time an external factor modiﬁes the c oncentration
of a single cytokine. The immune system achieves its robustness to e xternal
changes in the cytokine proﬁle through redundancy [29]. A large num ber of
cytokines can each have common eﬀects. Thus a certain result can occur
even if not all the cytokines leading to the eﬀect are expressed.
Indeed, the fact that the body uses many redundant cytokines c an have a
larger meaning. Consider that the eﬀects mediated by cytokines ha ve at least
two functions. The ﬁrst function is to maintain a healthy steady sta te, and
the second function relates to the ﬁne details of the steady state . In normal
behavior, the changes are felt at the level of the details, but in ext reme
situations, like the response to an external pathogen, the body w ill try to
change its total steady state and produce a fast and strong res ponse.
3 Discussion
3.1 Regulation of autoimmunity
This paper presents a simpliﬁed model of thekinetics ofthe concent rations of
the main cell and cytokine types in the evolution of a TH1 type autoimm une
disease. It shows thateven simple dynamics canexplainmanyofthec omplex
features in the evolution of the response. We have grouped the ma jor cells
and cytokines into single types, although there are obviously diﬀere nces in
the roles taken by each one of the cells we have grouped together. This
model ignores the eﬀects of localization and of tissue barriers (for example,
theblood/brainbarrier inEAE) in inhibiting the passage ofsome of cells and
allowing others. We did not take into account the eﬀects of the tissu e cells
(for example astrocytes in EAE, or islet cells in IDDM), of the cytokin es they
17
secrete, and of B cells and antibodies. Some major mechanisms were ignored
including anergy and the release of free antigen due to cell destruc tion.
All these simpliﬁcations render this a general feature model rathe r than
a precise quantitative description of the cell concentrations. Our model is
built on a double system of positive and negative feedback between id and
anti-id cells, and between TH1 and TH2 states. Such a structure co uld
be the basic feature of the selection between TH1 and TH2 for a gro up of
important antigens in the body. This model seems to describe the sit uation
both in EAE and in IDDM, and we have no reason to believe that it is
not general. Negative feedback keeps the general concentratio ns of all kinds
of cells within reasonable limits, and positive feedback enables the sys tem
to mount a fast enough response to an antigen when needed. With t his
structure, it is possible to maintain a population of T cells responding t o
self-antigens of the body, keeping them in a TH2 state where they m ay be
restrained.
3.2 Models
This kind of model shows the complex dynamics attained even by a sma ll
system containing only 5 cell types and 3 cytokine types. It shows t hat
even small systems need a kinetic description, and the system cann ot be
understood by an overall estimation of the eﬀect of one cell type o n the
others. Such models must be robust to changes in parameters, sin ce it is
obvious that the interactions between the cells in the body are not p recisely
ﬁxed and that the cells are constantly subjected to chemical noise impinging
onthem. Nevertheless, the body must keep its general steady st ate, although
the precise quantity of any cell is not very important.
3.3 Feedback loops
The present type of modeling shifts our attention from the number s of each
cell type to the global state of the immune system, which most of th e time
should be in some quasi-equilibrium between many opposing inﬂuences. The
way to analyze such a global state is by positive and negative feedba ck loops
and the interactions between them. According to this formalism, ou r model
can be described as a large negative feedback loop, built of 4 interna l loops :
•The id-anti-id cell negative feedback loop, in which are nested three
18
positive and one negative feedback loop. These include:
•The TH1 and TH2 cells each of which feedsback positively on itself.
•The TH1 and macrophage positive feedback.
•The TH2 and anti-id cell negative feedback.
In conclusion, the description of disease evolution can be based on a global
kineticview, andthesubsystems arenotcelltypesbutfeedbacklo ops. (ﬁgure
