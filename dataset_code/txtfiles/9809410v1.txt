Abstract
The stability of model proteins with designed sequences is a ssessed in terms
of the number of sequences (obtained from the designed seque nce through
mutations), which fold into the “native” conformation. By a complete enu-
meration of the total number of sequences obtained by introd ucing up to 4
point mutations and up to 7 composition–conserving mutatio ns (swapping
of amino acids) in a 36mers chain, it is found that there are 108−109se-
quences which in the folding process target onto the “native ” conformation.
Consequently, proteins with designed sequences display a r emarkable degree
of stability and, to a large extent, of designability.

A number of previous analyses [1–6] (reviewed in [7,8]) have provided a rguments and
supporting evidence for the deep connection existing between the energetic properties of
protein sequences and their ability to fold fast into their native conf ormations. In particular
it was found [2–4] that the presence of a large (compared to the dis persion of interaction
energies) energy gap between the native state and the bulk of misf olded conformations that
are structurally dissimilar to the native state is an important factor that ensures fast folding
into the native conformation (foldability requirement). A number of observations support
the notion that sequences of natural proteins have been optimize d to satisfy the foldability
requirement:
1) Random sequences undergo non-cooperative folding transition [9,10] while designed
sequences and proteins fold cooperatively [1,3,4,11,12].
2) The native state of random sequences is very unstable even to s mall changes in poten-
tial function [13] while the ones that have larger gaps are much more robust with respect to
changes in the energy function [14,15]. The latter behavior is charac teristic of real proteins
that exhibit the remarkable ability to maintain their native structure intact in a wide range
of conditions including variation of temperature, pH, solvent compo sition etc.
3) It was shown theoretically that ground (native) states of rand om sequences are very
unstable with respect to point mutations: the probability that a mut ated sequence has the
same native state scales as γ−8whereγis the number of conformations per one residue in
the chain [16]. In contrast, real proteins are able to accomodate n umerous mutations that
are neutral with respect to structure changes [17] . This fact ha s obvious implication for the
molecular evolution ofproteins: it accounts forthe existence of lar gefamilies of proteins that
may have diverged from a common root. Proteins belonging to a family have homologous
sequences and their native states are structurally similar.
While the stability of designed sequences with respect to point mutat ions has been
demonstrated [18] in simulations, and the fact that larger energy g aps imply greater ability
of the designed sequence to accomodate many neutral mutations acknowledged [1–4,19–21],
the actual quantitative analysis of how many mutations exist that p reserve the native state
2
was missing.
In what follows we present a quantitative analysis of how many neutr al mutations can
proteinlike sequences of various degree of gap optimization accomo date. The outcome of
this analysis is baﬄing. In fact, it will be concluded that designed prot eins can accomodate
billions of multiple mutations without changing their ability to fold on shor t call into the
native conformation.
For the analysis we use lattice model of a protein that has been used earlier by us
[18,23,24] and others [25,26]. The model sequences are composed of aminoacids of 20 types
and contain 36 monomers. Two aminoacids are considered interactin g if they occupy neigh-
boring positions on the lattice but are not sequence neighbors. The energy of the interaction
depends on the identity of the aminoacids involved, so that there is a 20×20 parameter
matrix that describes the energetics in the model. We used the set o f parameters suggested
by Miyazawa and Jernigan ( table 6 of Ref. [27]). The associated stan dard deviation of the
interaction energies between diﬀerent aminoacid types is σ= 0.3.
Our approach to protein simulations is based on the idea of designing s equences having a
large energy gap in the target conformation chosen to serve as a n ative state for simulations
[4,28].
A sequence that has suﬃciently low energy in a conformation chosen as native is denoted
as S36(cf. caption to Fig. 1). This sequence is the same as was studied in pr evious
publications [18,23,24]. In the units we are considering ( RTroom= 0.6 kcal/mol), the energy
of S36in its native conformation (cf. Fig. 1(a) ) is Enat=−16.5. Starting from a random
conﬁguration, the sequence S 36always reaches the native conﬁguration, and it does it in
a rather short time, of the order of 106MC steps. This is a consequence of the fact that
the value of the energy gap δ(=2.5), that is, the energy diﬀerence between the native and
the lowest dissimilar conﬁguration (conﬁguration with a similarity para meterq[29] much
smaller than one) is large, much larger than the variance of the cont act energies. The goal of
our present analysis is to characterize quantitatively how many mut ations can S36tolerate
without losing the ability to fold into its native state. In other words, our study aims at
3
providing an estimate of the number of sequences, having a certain degree of homology to
S36, that fold into its native structure.
To characterize quantitatively single or multiple mutations, we ascrib e to them a value
∆E[18], deﬁned as the diﬀerence between the energies of the altered s equence (S’ 36) and
of the intact chain (S 36), both calculated in the native conﬁguration (Fig. 1(a) ). The
quantity ∆ Eis a measure of how the energy gap changes upon a mutation provide d that
the distribution of energies of conformations that are dissimilar to t he native state remains
unaﬀected by the mutation [18]. This was shown to be the case when m utations do not
change the aminoacid compositions [3,4,18]. In this study we have analy sed both the kinds
of mutations which conserve and which do not conserve the compos ition of the protein.
This gives a lower and an upper limit for the number of mutations which t he “wild–type”
sequence can tollerate.
Acompleteenumerationofallsequences S′
36hasbeendoneuptosevenmutationskeeping
ﬁxed the amino acid composition of the chain (swapping), and up to fo ur without this
constraint (pointlike). Simulating the dynamics [4] of ﬁfty sequence s chosen among the
mutated sequences, with the same composition of S 36and with ∆ E < δ, it turned out that
in 100% of the cases, they can reach the native conformation in a tim e comparable to the
folding time of S 36. Repeating the same analysis on ﬁfty sequences with up to four poin tlike
mutations, we observed that only in three cases the chain ﬁnds con formations dissimilar
from the native one, with lower energy, and it is not able to ﬁnd the na tive conformation
within the simulation time.

mutationsforthecaseofthreesequences designedtofoldintoth estructureshowninFig.1(a)
withdiﬀerent energygaps. Thedistributionsforallthreesequenc es appeartobevery similar
to each other (Fig.2). This is also true for composition–conserving m utations and for the
diﬀerent numbers of mutations we have analyzed (data not shown) . These results suggest
that the distribution nm(∆E) associated with mmutations has some degree of universality.

Given a sequence characterized by an energy gap δ, it is then possible to calculate the
number of sequences which fold to the same native structure (i.e. f or which there is still
some energy gap between the native structure and the bulk of dec oys) and which diﬀer from
the ”wild–type” sequence by mmutations. To do this one has to calculate the quantity
Nm(δ) =/integraldisplayδ
−∞dE nm(E). (1)
As an example we provide the function Nm(δ) form= 4 and for the case of pointlike
mutations (Fig.3). The corresponding values of Nmfor the sequence S 36(whose gap is
δ= 2.5) for up to 4 pointlike and 7 swap mutations are shown in Table 1. The c alculation of
the total number of sequences N(δ) =/summationtext
mNm(δ) is beyond our calculational power, and can
be established only with approximate methods [30]. The results obtain ed with the “small”
number of mutations shown in Table 1, and which provide a lower limit to t he total number
of sequences folding to the same native structure is in any case impr essive, namely 108−109.
The same study has been repeated using other two fully compact ta rget structures (Figs.
1(b) and 1(c) ), generated by the collapse of a 36 monomers homop olymeric chain at low
temperature (below the θ–point, see e.g. [31]). The results are virtually identical to the ones
shown in Fig. 2.
The present study further suggests that the normalized gap ξ=δ/σ(or the closely
related to it z-score [1,29,32]) is a major determinant of the ability of s equences to fold. To
this end, the ”resilience” of sequences against point mutations is dir ectly related to their
energetic impact: if the cumulative eﬀect of mutations on the energ y of the native state
is weak enough so that the energy gap for the native state remains , the mutations are
neutral and the mutated sequences will still fold into the native sta te, albeit at a decreased
stability. Therefore, the whole issue of the estimating the number o f mutations that are
tolerated by a sequence (and hence the number of homologous seq uences that fold to the
sameconformation)isreduced toenumerating mutationsthatkee ptheenergygapasdeﬁned
before.
Anotheraspect ofsequence designknownas”designability” wasdis cussed byanumber of
5
authors [19,33,34]. The concept of ”designability” focuses on the en tropy in sequence space
stating that structures that can accomodate more sequences t hat have them as the non–
degenerate ground state are more ”designable”, and represent the structures of naturally
existing proteins. Our study is not entirely unrelated to the issue of designability since it
showsthatthegreaterthegapis, themoresequenceshomologou stothe“wildtype”sequence
exist that target on the “native” conformation in the folding proce ss and, as a consequence,
has this conformation as its non–degenerate ground state. Howe ver, it addresses in fact
a diﬀerent question, namely: how many sequences homologous to th e ”wild-type” exist
that fold into the same conformation, being this number a lower limit fo r the degree of
designability of a structure. In order to fully address this question within our approach one
has to consider two further issues: a) that there exist many non- homologous sequences that
can still fold to the same conformation [20,35,36], and b) that the des ignability principle
emphasizes the strong dependence of the number of sequences o n the properties of the target
structure. In any case, we have provided circumstantial evidenc e concerning the fact that
designability of a given structure may be closely related to the maxima l gap with which
sequences can be ﬁt into it. (A similar point was also made earlier by sev eral authors
[19–21,33]). In this case the issue of designability reduces to the que stion of what structures
allow sequences with greater gaps. We are planning to address this is sue in the near future.
Summing up, in thispaper we provided a quantitative estimate ofthe n umber ofmutated
sequences that are still able to fold to the same conformation and f ound it to be ”astro-
nomically” large. The actual number of these sequences, and thus the designability of the
corresponding conformation, is controlled by the dimensionless par ameterξ=δ/σ, which
in turn also controls the folding ability of the notional protein.
