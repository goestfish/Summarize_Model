Abstract
We address the question, related with the origin of the genet ic
code, of why are there three bases per codon in the translatio n to
protein process. As a followup to our previous work, [1, 2, 3] we
approach this problem by considering the translocation pro perties
of primitive molecular machines, which capture basic featu res of ri-
bosomal/messenger RNA interactions, while operating unde r prebi-
otic conditions. Our model consists of a short one-dimensio nal chain
of charged particles(rRNA antecedent) interacting with a p olymer
(mRNA antecedent) via electrostatic forces. The chain is su bject to
external forcing that causes it to move along the polymer whi ch is
ﬁxed in a quasi one dimensional geometry. Our numerical and a n-
alytic studies of statistical properties of random chain/p olymer po-
tentials suggest that, under very general conditions, a dyn amics is
attained in which the chain moves along the polymer in steps o f three
1
monomers. By adjusting the model in order to consider presen t day
genetic sequences, we show that the above property is enhanc ed for
coding regions. Intergenic sequences display a behavior cl oser to the
random situation. We argue that this dynamical property cou ld be
one of the underlying causes for the three base codon structu re of the
genetic code
1 Introduction
The origin of the genetic code has been a subject of intense resear ch since
its structure was completely elucidated in the early 1970’s. In subse quent
years, the scientiﬁc community has produced several theories in o rder to ex-
plain why the genetic code has this structure. Among these theorie s, the
most prominent ones are the stereochemical theory, the frozen -accident the-
ory and the coevolutionary theory [4]-[9]. Roughly speaking, these t heories
try to account for the structure of the genetic code by looking at the in-
teractions between codons and amino acids, the biosynthetic relat ionships
among diﬀerent amino acids and how the metabolic pathways between them
have been selected throughout evolution. Nevertheless, the fac t that all the
codons are made up of three nucleotides, has mostly been taken fo r granted
and barely brought into question.
One of the most widely used arguments found in the literature to exp lain
the trinucleotide codon structure of the genetic code, was given b y Sidney
Brenner in 1961 [10, 11]. According to this argument, codons are ma de up of
three nucleotides (or bases, for short) because there are 20 am ino acids to be
speciﬁed by the genetic information expressed by a 4 letter “alphab et” (the
four bases A,G,C,U). If codons were composed of only two bases, th ere would
be only 16 diﬀerent combinations (42), which are not enough to specify for
20 amino acids. If instead, codons were made up of more than three bases,
there would be at least 256 combinations (44), and these are too many for
only 20 amino acids. Hence, less than three bases per codon are not enough,
and more than three would imply an excessive degeneration of the co de. The
result coming out from this argument is that three bases per codon is the
optimal “bit of information” that can be used in order to specify for the 20
diﬀerent amino acids by means of a 4 letter “alphabet”.
The above argument, however, does not constitute an explanatio n by
2
itself, mainly because it only moves the question of “why three?” to t he
questions of “why twenty?” or for that matter “why four?”. The re is no
reason for the genetic information to codify for only 20 amino acids s ince
living organisms use more than those speciﬁed by the genetic code [12 ]. In
addition, this argument assumes that all the codons must have the same
length (number of bases), even though more eﬃcient codes can be obtained
byallowing thelengthofthecodonstovary[13]. Finally, giventhat20amino
acids have to be speciﬁed by using 4 diﬀerent bases, Brenner’s argu ment
leads to the simplest code that might be thought of. But even in such a case,
simplicity has to be accounted for as a relevant criterium.
In this work we address the question of the origin of the three-bas e codon
structure of the genetic code from a dynamical point of view. We co nsider
a simple molecular machine model which captures some of the principal fea-
tures of the interaction between primitive realizations of the riboso me and
of the mRNA. Our main objective is to present a dynamical scenario, com-
patible with prebiotic conditions, of how the triplet structure of the genetic
code could have arisen. The model we propose is a follow up of the one
introduced by Aldana, Cocho and Mart´ ınez-Mekler [1, 2, 3] and is co nsistent
with the current evidence suggesting the “RNA world” hypothesi1s [14]. In
this scheme the crucial molecules involved in the prebiotic and protob iotic
processes, that eventually led to codiﬁcation and translation mech anisms of
the genetic information, were RNA related.q
In our model, based on the setup depicted in Fig. 1, a short one-
dimensional polymer composed of Mmonomers interacts with a much longer
one, via electrostatic forces. In order to avoid confusion, from n ow on we will
refer to the short polymer as “the chain”, and to the long polymer s imply
as “the polymer”. The electrostatic interaction between the chain and the
polymer is due to the presence of electric charges, or multipolar mom ents, in
the monomers of both the chain and the polymer.
The charges ofthe monomers ofthechain andof thepolymer areas signed
at random following a uniform distribution. Therefore, the resulting chain-
polymer interaction potential has a random proﬁle. The chain is allowe d to
movealongthepolymer, butisconstrainedtoremainataﬁxedperpe ndicular
distance σfrom it. Consequently, transport is one-dimensional. One of our
main results is to show that under very general conditions, a dynam ics is
attained in which the chain moves along the polymer in eﬀective “steps ”
whose mean length is three monomers. We argue that this dynamical feature

may be one of the underlying causes of the three base codon struc ture of the
genetic code.
This paper is organized as follows: section 2 describes in detail the mo del
and the assumptions introduced. In section 3 we recall some statis tical as-
pects of our previous analysis [1, 2, 3] of the random interaction po tentials
between the chain and the polymer for the simplest case in which the f ormer
is composed of just one particle ( M= 1). We exhibit numerically that, even
in this simple case, the mean distance ¯dbetween consecutive minima along
the interaction potential is very close to three: ¯d∼3 (taking the monomer
length as spatial unit). After retrieving the analytical expression for this
distance [1], we then look into the probability Pm(d) of two neighboring po-
tential minima being separated by a distance d. Subindex mrefers to the
number of diﬀerent types of monomers in the polymer and in the chain . This
probability function shows that, even though the mean distance ¯dis close to
three, the most probable distance between consecutive minima is d∗= 2 for
m >2. In section 4 the monomer charges along the polymer are assigned
in correspondence with protein-coding regions of the genome of re al organ-
isms (e.g. Drosophila orE. coli) instead of at random. For this case, the
probability function Pm(d) is modiﬁed so that not only the mean distance is
¯d∼3, but also the most probable one happens to be d∗= 3.
4
In section 5 we introduce the more realistic case M >1, which takes
into account the fact that the ribosome is not a point particle, that it has
spatial structure and presents several simultaneous contact p oints between
its own rRNA and the mRNA polymer. For small chain lengths ( M∼10),
theprobability distribution Pm(d)is indicative ofwide ﬂuctuationsandhasa
formstrongly dependent ontheparticular assignment ofcharges inthechain.
One ofour main ﬁndings is that for such chains themost likely conﬁgur ations
are those in which both, the mean distance ¯dand the most probable one d∗
are equal to three, even when the monomer charges along the polymer and
the chain are assigned at random . In section 6 we analyze the dynamics
resulting from the model when an external force is pulling the chain, forcing
it to move as a rigid object along the polymer. The power spectrum of the
velocity of the chain reveals that, under some very general circum stances, for
small chain lengths ( M∼10), there is a sharp periodicity in the dynamics
of the system, with a slowing down of the velocity of the chain every t hree
monomers. Finally, section 7 is devoted to the discussion of the resu lts and
their relevance to the origin of the genetic code.
2 The model
The model we propose consists of a chain of Mmonomers interacting with
a very long polymer composed of Nmonomers, with N→ ∞(see Fig.1).
The chain is constrained to remain at a given distance σperpendicular to
the polymer and is allowed to move in along the polymer, we shall deﬁne
xas its position in this direction relative to the polymer. We will denote
the monomer charges in the chain and in the polymer by {pi}and{qj},
respectively. Weshouldmentionthatby“charge”wedonotnecess arily mean
Coulomb charge. Both {pi}and{qj}could be dipolar moments, induced
polarizabilities, or similar quantities resulting from electrostatic inter actions
between chain monomers and polymer monomers with potentials of th e form
1/rα, whereαcharacterizes the “charge” type.
We will assume that all the monomers in the chain, and separately, all
the monomers in the polymer, are of the same nature, namely, all of them
are either Coulomb charges, or dipolar moments, or polarizable molec ules,
etc. In addition, taking into account that in the origin of life condition s the
genetic molecules were not yet likely to convey any structured infor mation,
5
we will consider the charges {pi}and{qj}to be discrete independent random
variables, acquiring one of the mdiﬀerent values ξ1, ξ2, ..., ξ mwith the
same probability. Hence, the probability function P(q) for both, the {pi}
and{qj}variables, will be
P(q) =1
mm/summationdisplay
j=1δ(q−ξj) (1)
whereδ(q) is the Dirac delta function. In general, in this work we will take
the values ξ1, ξ2, ..., ξ mas integers. Parameter mrepresents the number of
diﬀerent types of monomers from which the polymer and the chain ar e made
of. For the case of real genetic sequences m= 4, but we will not restrict the
value ofmto be 4.
All the monomers will have the same length L, which we take as the
spatial unit of measure: L= 1. We also assume the charge in each of the
monomers to be uniformly distributed along the length L, so that the charge
densityλj(x) in the jth-monomer of the polymer, for example, is a constant
whose value is λj(x) =qj/L. Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning that the
dynamics of the model does not depend strongly on the particular s hape
of the monomer charge density λj(x), as long it is a smooth function of x
(“smooth” in the sense of diﬀerentiability).
With the preceding assumptions, the interaction potential Vij(x) between
the ith-monomer in the chain and the jth-monomer in the polymer is giv en
by
Vij(x) =Kpiqj/integraldisplayx+i

j−1dx′dx′′
[(x′−x′′)2+σ2]α/2(2)
whereKis a constant whose value depends on the unit system used to
measure the physical quantities. In the above expression, Lhas already been
set equal to 1. Parameter αcharacterizes the kind of interaction between
the chain and the polymer: α= 1 corresponds to an ion-ion interaction,
α= 2 represents an ion-dipole interaction, and so forth. Note that t his
parameter does not depend on the indices iandj, since all the monomers
in the chain are of the same nature and those in the polymer are them selves
of the same nature, diﬀering from each other only in the value of the charge
they contain. The overall interaction potential Vα
σ(x) between the whole

chain and the entire polymer is given by the superposition of the individ ual
potentials Vij(x):

Equations (2) and (3) establish the type of random potentials we will be
considering. Our ﬁrst aim is to analyze the spatial structure of the se poten-
tials, giving their statistical characterization. This will be done in the three
following sections. Subsequently, we will consider the dynamics of th e chain
moving along the polymer interacting with it by means of a random pote n-
tial, subject to an external driving force and seek under what con ditions, if
any, transport in “steps” of three monomers can be achieved.
3 Random potentials: M= 1
Let us start with the simplest case M= 1, in which the chain consists of
just one monomer. We will refer to this case as the “single-monomer -chain”
case, and to the chain simply as “the particle”. The reason to consid er this
simple situation is twofold: on one hand, it is useful in order to introdu ce
the relevant ideas behind the model. On the other hand, it is simple eno ugh
as to obtain exact analytical results in a more o less straightforwar d way.
In previous work we have already analyzed some statistical proper ties of
the random potentials given by expressions (2) and (3) for the cas eM= 1
[1, 2, 3]. After a short review of some of those results we center ou r attention
on the probability distribution Pm(d).

Note that in the previous expression we have set Kp1, the only charge in
the chain, equal to one. Fig.2 shows three graphs of the potential Vα
σ(x) for
σ= 0.5 and diﬀerent values of the parameter α. To generate these graphs,
the following probability function for the charges {qj}was used:
7

µ=−3δ(q−µ) (5)
namely, each one of the variables {qj}acquired one of the six diﬀerent values
{±1,±2,±3}with probability 1 /6 (m= 6). In Fig.2, the random realization
of the charges {qj}along the polymer was the same for the three graphs.
As can be seen from this ﬁgure, the distribution of maxima and minima
along the potential does not change by varying the value of the par ameter
α, in the sense that all the maxima and minima remain essentially at the
same positions. What occurs as αtakes larger and larger values is that the
potential becomes a step-like function.
Fig.3presentsananalogoussituation, butnowkeeping αconstant( α= 2)
and varying σ. The behavior of the potential is similar to the previous case:
the potential becomes a step-like function as σdecreases and the positions
of the maxima and minima are not appreciably modiﬁed.
Theaboveconsiderationsexhibit thatforsmallvaluesof σ, say0< σ≤1,
the distribution of maxima and minima along the potential is entirely det er-
mined by the distribution of charges along the polymer and is independ ent of
the particular values acquired by the parameters αandσ. Therefore, in or-
der to ﬁnd out the distribution of maxima and minima along the interact ion
potential, it is possible to substitute the continuous random potent ial given
by expressions (2) and (3), by the equivalent step-like potential d eﬁned by

value is directly proportional to the charge qjof the jth-monomer in the
polymer:

Figure 4: In a one dimensional potential, the dynamics is determined b y
the distribution of maxima and minima. If a molecule is moving along the
potential and is subject to an external force, it will spend more tim e in the
potential minima thaninthe maxima. This kind ofmotioncan beconsider ed
as if the molecule were “jumping” from one minimum to the next.
between consecutive potential minima. This probability function give s im-
portant information concerning the dynamics of the system. If so me external
force is acting on the particle (or the chain), forcing it to move in one di-
rection (right or left) along the polymer, the particle will spend more time
in the energy minima than in the maxima. Such a movement may be inter-
preted by considering the particle as “jumping” from one minimum to t he
next (see Fig.4). It is worth noticing that the mean distance betwee n con-
secutive minima in the potentials shown in Fig.2 and Fig.3 is nearly three.
In Fig.2 there are 33 minima distributed among 100 monomers, and con -
sequently the mean distance between consecutive minima in this case is
¯d= 100/33≃3.03. Analogously, the mean distance between neighboring
minima in Fig.3 is ¯d= 100/34≃2.94. Therefore, it is expected that in its
motion along the polymer, the velocity of the particle will slow down, on
average, every three monomers, being momentarily “trapped” in e ach of the
potential minima.
By using the step-like limit, in reference [1] we have shown that the me an

wheremis the number of diﬀerent monomer types. The above equation
shows that the mean distance ¯dis always between 3 and 4, and approaches
3 asymptotically as m→ ∞. In particular, for m= 4 (the biological value)
we have ¯d≃3.43.
In order to characterize the ﬂuctuations around the mean distan ce¯d, it
is useful to compute the probability distribution function Pm(d), which we
recall, gives the probability of two consecutive minima being separate d by a
distance dwhen there are mdiﬀerent types of monomers. In the step-like
limit, this computation is carried out by counting all the conﬁguration s of
the step-like variables {Vj}in which there are two minima, one at Vjand the
other atVj+d, with no other minima in between. The situation is illustrated
in Fig.5a. Since in the step-like limit the interaction potential is constan t
along every monomer, we will adopt the convention to measure the d istance
dbetween two adjacent minima from the mid point of the ﬁrst minimum to
the mid point of the second one, as illustrated in Fig.5b. With the above
convention, the resulting distances dcan only acquire integer or half-integer
values. For a ﬁnite number mof diﬀerent charges, the explicit calculation of
the probability function Pm(d) consists mainly on counting conﬁgurations,
though conceptually straightforward, it involves a considerable am ount of
algebra. Here we present the ﬁnal expressions:

the above expressions, Nm(d) is a polynomial whose degree and coeﬃcients
depend on m. Form= 2,m= 3 and m= 4 the polynomials are given by

which has a much simpler form:
P∞(d) = 32d
(d+3)!/parenleftBig
d2+d−2/parenrightBig
(12)
The preceding distributions are plotted in Fig.6. It can be seen from
this ﬁgure that the most probable distance d∗between consecutive potential
minima is d∗= 2, except for the case m= 2 in which d∗= 3. Hence,
according to the transport mechanism suggested in Fig.4, wheneve r there
are more than two diﬀerent types of monomers, the particle will mov e along
the polymer in “jumps” whose mean length is close to three, but whos e most
probable length is actually two. The diﬀerence between the mean dist ance
¯dand the most probable distance d∗is due to the presence of “tails” in the
probability function Pm(d). Namely, to the fact that Pm(d) has non zero
values even for large d. Nevertheless, in section 5 we will show that these
“tails” can be shrunk almost to zero when the chain is made up of more than
one particle ( M >1). This is one of the main results of this paper.
To end this section, it is worth mentioning that half-integer distance s be-
tween two neighboring minima occur when one or both of these minima e x-
tend over several monomers (see Fig.5b). In these conﬁguration s, the charges
of the adjacent monomers constituting the extended minimum have the same
value. Conﬁgurations in which groups of adjacent equally charged m onomers
occur, are less likely than conﬁgurations in which adjacent monomer s have
diﬀerent charges, andtheformer tendto disappear as mincreases (seeFig.6).
4 Real genetic sequences: M= 1
The charges {qj}along the polymer can be assigned in correspondence with
the genetic sequence of an organism, rather than in a random way. The
purpose of doing so is to ﬁnd out how the potential minima and maxima
along real genetic sequences are distributed, and to compare the resulting
distribution with the one corresponding to the random case. Since g enetic

sequences are made out of four diﬀerent bases (A, U, C and G) we c onsider
four diﬀerent possible values ξ1, ξ2, ξ3, ξ4for the charges {qj}, i.e.m= 4.
To proceed further, it is necessary to establish a correspondenc e between the
charge values ξ1,...,ξ 4and the four bases A, U, C and G. An arbitrary look
up table is the following:
basecharge value

U −1
C +1

Withtheabovecorrespondence, ifthejth-baseinagivengenetics equence
happens to be A, for example, then the charge of the correspond ing jth-
monomer in the polymer will be qj=−2.
Figure Fig.7a shows the probability distribution P4(d) computed numer-
ically by using a Drosophila melanogaster protein-coding sequence, 45500
bases in length (several genes were concatenated to construct this sequence).
The mean distance between consecutive potential minima for this se quence
is¯d≃3.15 and, as follows from the ﬁgure, the most probable distance is
d∗= 3. Therefore, in the “real sequence case” not only is the mean dis tance
¯dvery close to 3, but also the most probable distance d∗turns out to be 3.
A comparison of Fig.6c with Fig.7a, shows that for protein-coding gen etic
sequences, the potential minima along the polymer are more often s eparated
by three monomers thanin therandom case. When protein-coding s equences
are used, the value of P4(d) increases at d= 3 and decreases at d= 2.
The above behavior does not occur when non-coding sequences of the
genome are used for the monomer charge assignment along the poly mer.
Fig.7bshowstheprobabilityfunction P4(d)forthecaseinwhichthemonomer
charges areincorrespondence withanintergenic sequence ofthe Drosophila’s
genome. The length of the sequence is again 45500 bases. As can be seen
from the ﬁgure, in this case the probability function P4(d) looks much more
like the one obtained in the random case.
It is important to remark that the behavior of P4(d) exhibited in Fig.7a
for real protein-coding sequences does not depend on the partic ular corre-

of the same order of magnitude [16]2and are fulﬁlled by our present choice
of{±1,±2}. The order relation is necessary for the interaction potential to
have maxima and minima. It is worth asking the eﬀect that changes in t he
order relation have on the probability function P4(d). There are 24 possi-
ble order relations among the four bases A, T, C, and G (4! permuta tions).
The 24 probability functions P4(d) corresponding to these permutations are
plotted in Fig.8a for Drosophila’s protein-coding sequence. As can be seen
from the ﬁgure, the probability functions basically overlap, indepen dently
of the particular order relation between the bases, with a peak at d∗= 3.
The invariance of P4(d) under base permutations also holds for non-coding
sequences as is shown in Fig. 8.b., where d∗= 2 for intergenic sequences of
Drosophila Drosophila’s . This valueof d∗suggests that non-coding sequences
behave as random structures.
The “peaking at d∗= 3” of the probability function P4(d) seems to be a
general characteristic associated with the protein-coding seque nces of living
organisms, not only with Drosophila . In Fig.9 we show the probability func-
tions obtained from protein-coding sequences of diﬀerent organis ms, and in
all the cases the probability functions present their highest value a td∗= 3
(the mean distance ¯dis also very close to 3). The fact that the above charac-
teristicisabsent innon-codinggeneticsequences maybeinterpret ed inevolu-
tionary terms. Genetic sequences directly involved in the protein-t ranslation
processes were selected (among other things) as to bring the dist ance be-
tween consecutive potential minima closer to 3, both in mean and fre quency
of occurrence. This interpretation raises a question: how likely is it t o obtain
a randomly generated sequence with a structure similar to that of p rotein-
coding sequences? In other words, if we generate a random seque nce and
compute its probability function Pm(d), how likely is it to come up with a
probability function peaking at d∗= 3?.
In order to answer this question, we deﬁne the parameters p3/2andp3/4
as

Note also the scale on the axes.

If the probability function P4(d) associated with a given sequence has its
highest value at d∗= 3, then the corresponding parameters p3/2andp3/4will
both be greater than one. Otherwise, one or both of these param eters will
be smaller than one.
Fig.10a is a plot of p3/2vs.p3/4for 1000 random sequences, each one con-
sisting of 500 bases (which is a typical length of sequences coding fu nctional
proteins [17]). It can be seen from the ﬁgure that only a small fract ion of the
points (about 0.224)fall in region I, for which p3/2>1 andp3/4>1. The rest
of the points fall in region II, in which p3/2<1 andp3/4>1. Therefore, the
probability of having a random sequence, 500 bases long, whose con secutive
potential minima are more often separated by a distance d∗= 3, is close to
0.224.
On the other hand, Figs.10b-f show similar graphs, but using protein -
coding sequences of real organisms. These graphs were constru cted by an-
alyzing short coding sequences 500 bases in length. The fraction of points
falling in region I ( p3/2>1 andp3/4>1) for the diﬀerent organisms of Fig.10
is summarized in the following table:
Organism Frac. region I
random sequence 0.224000
Chlorella vulg. 0.788235
Drosophila 0.780220
Deinococcus rad. 0.803525
Myc. tuberculosis 0.802643
Aeropyrum pernix 0.719973
These results show that protein-coding sequences are much more likely
to have their consecutive potential minima separated by a distance d∗= 3.
To end thissection, we shouldmake a further comment. The fact th atthe
most probabledistance d∗between consecutive potential minima is d∗= 3for
22
protein-coding sequences, is a consequence of the order in which t he bases or
codons appear along the sequence and are not related to the relat ive weight
(fraction) of their occurrence. For example, Fig.11a shows the pr obability
function P4(d) corresponding to a protein-coding sequence of Escherichia
coli, 45000 bases in length. In Fig.11b the codon composition, expresse d as
fractional occurrence, of this sequence is depicted. To constru ct this last
graph, we labelled each codon in an arbitrary way, by assigning an inte ger
number, from 0 for AAA up to 63 for GGG. On the horizontal axis the num-
ber of the codon is plotted, and on the vertical axis its fractional o ccurrence
ontheE. colisequence. Finally, Fig.11cshows theprobabilityfunction P4(d)
corresponding to a random sequence, of the same length and codo n compo-
sition as the one used in Fig.11a. As can be seen, for the “randomized ”E.
colisequence the most probable distance is no longer d∗= 3 as in Fig.11a,
butd∗= 2.
5 Extended chain: M >1
In this section we consider the case in which the chain is composed of m ore
than one single monomer. As mentioned before, this reﬂects the fa ct that
the ribosome is not a point particle after all. At each given time, the rib o-
some interacts with the mRNA at several points, giving rise to a collec tive
interaction. Electron microscopy has revealed that the mRNA thre ad passes
across the ribosome throughout a tunnelabout 10nm long and 2nm in di-
ameter [17]. Since nucleotide length is about 0.5nm, around 20 nucleot ides
may be in a position to interact simultaneously with the ribosome. Takin g
the above into account, we will work with a small chain, assuming M= 10
as a reasonable length.
In the step-like limit, the interaction potential equation can be writt en
by equation (3) now with the variables {Vj}given by:
Vj=KqjM/summationdisplay
i=1pi (15)
Themainmodiﬁcationcausedbyusingequation(15)insteadof(7)fo rthe
random variables {Vj}is that they are no longer statistically independent.
Due to the collective interaction between the chain and the polymer, these
variables are strongly correlated. This makes the problem of ﬁnding the

24
probability function Pm(d) too diﬃcult for analytical treatment. Therefore,
we will present only numerical results.
In our simulations, Pm(d) presents an erratic behavior. The shape of this
function strongly depends on the particular realization of monomer charges
in the chain. For example, Fig.12a shows the probability function Pm(d) for
a polymer 500 monomers in length and a particular realization of charg es in
a 10-monomer chain. The charge values we used to generate these graphs
were{±1,±2}. Fig.12b shows a similar graph but for a diﬀerent realization
of charges along the chain (the realization of charges in the polymer was the
sameinbothcases). Ascanbeseen, these twographsdiﬀerconsid erably: the
ﬁrst presents a very sharp maximum at d∗= 2, whereas the second does so
atd∗= 3. Wide ﬂuctuations in the probability function Pm(d) were always
present in our numerical simulations.
This ﬂuctuating behavior did not occur in thesingle-monomer-chain c ase.
It is apparent from Fig.10a that the ﬂuctuations of the probability f unction
Pm(d) in that case are rather small: the probability function has its highes t
valueatd∗= 2forthemajorityoftherealizations(77.6%)inthecase M= 1.
Also, the ﬂuctuations are concentrated in a small region of the ( p3/2,p3/4)
plane.
In order to have an idea of the magnitude of the ﬂuctuations of the
probability function Pm(d) in the extended-chain case, we can make use of
the parameters p3/2andp3/4deﬁned in expression (14). The ﬂuctuations of
the probability function in the extenden-chain case are shown in Fig.1 3. To
construct this ﬁgure, a polymer 500 monomers in length was used alo ng with
a 10-monomer chain. The charge values in thepolymer aswell asinthe chain
were again {±1,±2}. The parameters p3/2andp3/4were calculated for 4500
charge realizations in the chain (the realization of charges in the poly mer was
the same in all the cases). Fig.13 is the plot of p3/2versusp3/4for these 4500
realizations. Two remarks are worth mentioning about this ﬁgure:
•The points are spread out over a much wider region than in the single-
monomer-chain case (Fig.10a).
•The majority of the points fall in the region in which both p3/2>1 and
p3/4>1.
The following table shows the fractions of the points falling in each of t he
four regions of the graph:

parameters for 4500 realizations or monomer charges in the chain. Note that
the points spread out over a much wider region than in Fig.10a. Also, in
this case the majority of the points fall in the region for which p3/2>1 and
p3/4>1.

Therefore, when a collective interaction between the polymer and t he
chain prevails, a remarkable property arises: The probability of hav ing a
random interaction potential, whose consecutive minima are more of ten sep-
arated by three monomers, is the largest.
6 Dynamics
Recent experimental evidence suggests that the ribosome-mRNA system
presents a ratchet-like behavior in the protein synthesis transloc ation pro-
cess [18]. In this view, the ribosome is tightly attached to the mRNA th read
intheabsenceofGTP.Thisissobecausethechannelintheribosome through
which the mRNA passes, is more or less closed. When a GTP molecule is
supplied (and transformed into GDP), this channel opens leaving th e mRNA
thread free to move one codon. Subsequently the mRNA passage in the
ribosome closes again, trapping the mRNA molecule.
In this clamping mechanism several physicochemical factors are inv olved,
which if taken into account in detail would lead to complex dynamical eq ua-
tions hard to handle. In this work our approach is to look into the beh avior
of oversimpliﬁed molecular models which might capture some of the ess en-
tial dynamical features of the system and may shed some light on ho w this
mechanism could have arisen in the origin of life conditions.
In our modelling the dynamics of the system is governed by the appli-
cation of an external force Fexto the chain in the horizontal direction, i.e.
parallel to the polymer. By this means the chain will be forced to move
along the polymer. In principle, the force Fexmay be time dependent, but
we will restrict ourselves to a constant term. This force might come from a
chemical pump (like GDP)or fromany other electromagnetic forcep resent in
prebiotic conditions. The only purpose of this force in our model is to drive
the chain along the polymer (which is assumed to be ﬁxed, N→ ∞limit),
avoiding it from getting trapped in some of the minima of the polymer-c hain
28
interaction potential V(x). Therefore, we will also assume that Fexsatisﬁes
|Fex|>max|∂V(x)/∂x|.
Our analysis relies on Newton’s equation of motion in a high friction
regime, where inertial eﬀects can be neglected. This regime actually exists in
biological molecular ratchets similar to the one we are considering [19, 20].
Under such conditions, the Newton’s equation of motion acquires th e form
γdx
dt=−∂Vα
σ(x)
∂x+Fex (16)
whereγis the friction coeﬃcient. In what follows, we will set γ= 1, which is
equivalent to setting the measure of the time unit. The above, thou gh a de-
terministic equation, gives rise to a random dynamics due to the rand omness
of the interaction potential Vα
σ(x). In order to start analyzing this random
dynamics, let us consider ﬁrst the single-monomer-chain case M= 1. In this
case, as before, we will refer to the chain simply as “the particle”.
6.1 Single-monomer chain: M= 1. Random sequences.
In Fig.14a we show a typical realization of the velocity of the particle v(x) as
a function of its position xalong the polymer. This graph was constructed
by solving numerically the equation of motion (16), using the fourth o rder
Runge-Kuta method. The parameter values used were α= 2 and σ= 0.5,
and the monomer charge values were {±1,±2}(casem= 4). Fig.14b shows
the local-transit times of the particle along a short segment of the p olymer
(40 monomers in length). This transit time is represented in arbitrar y units,
and was computed by counting how many time steps the particle spen t in
every spatial interval ∆ xthroughout the polymer. In the graph shown, the
value of ∆ xwas ∆x= 0.25. It is apparent from this ﬁgure that, in its way
along the polymer, the particle spends more time in certain regions th an in
others, the former being more or less regularly spaced along the po lymer.
In order to ﬁnd out the spatial regularities in the dynamics of the sy stem,
it is convenient to take the Fourier transform of the velocity v(x) of the
particle. Let us call ˆ v(k) the Fourier transform of v(x),kbeing the Fourier
variable conjugate to x.
Fig.15 shows the Fourier power spectrum of the velocity, |ˆv(k)|2, for two
diﬀerent realizations of monomer charges in the polymer. The param eter
values in Fig.15a and Fig.15b are {σ= 0.5, α= 1}and{σ= 0.5, α= 4}

31
respectively. These graphs were computed for the case m= 4, using the
charge values {±1,±2}. From the ﬁgure, it is evident that there exists a
dominant frequency k∗in the power spectrum of the velocity (the highest
peak), whose corresponding spatial periodicity is λ∗= 2π/k∗∼3.3. The
power spectrum reveals a dynamical regularity in the motion of the p article
throughout the polymer. This regularity is inherited from the one pr esent
in the random potential, in the sense that the particle spends more t ime in
the minima than in the maxima. The consequence is a slowing down of the
velocity nearly every three monomers, which is reﬂected in the powe r spec-
trum. Our interpretation is that the peak occurring in the power sp ectrum
of the velocity conveys the information on the average distance ¯dbetween
consecutive potential minima, which for the case m= 4 is¯d∼3.4.
6.2 Single-monomer chain: M= 1. Real sequences.
As in section 4, we can assign the charges along the polymer in corres pon-
dence with the genetic sequence of real organisms. In order to do that, we
will use the same base-charge correspondence as in expression (1 3). The ob-
jective is to ﬁnd out how the dynamics of the system changes when u sing
real genetic sequences instead of random ones. In what follows, t he value of
the parameters αandσwill beα= 1,σ= 0.5.
The power spectrum of the velocity of the particle throughout the poly-
mer, when using protein-coding sequences of diﬀerent organisms, is shown
in Fig.16. To generate these graphs, short coding sequences of se veral or-
ganisms, each 10000 monomers in length, were used. Two points are worth
noticing in this ﬁgure. First, the peak in the power spectrum is much h igher
than in the random case. This indicates that there is a much more well de-
ﬁned periodicity in the dynamics generated by interaction potentials when
protein-coding sequences are used. Second, the spatial periodic ity reﬂected
in the peak of the power spectrum is much closer to 3 than in the rand om
case.
This dynamical behavior is not present when real but non-coding se -
quences are used. For example, in Fig.17 we show the power spectru m of
the velocity of the particle along the polymer, for two cases in which t he
monomer charges in the polymer were assigned in correspondence w ith inter-
genic regions of two organisms. As can be seen, the structure of s uch spectra
is similar to the one obtained in the random case. In this sense, interg enic

periodicities. Also, note that these spatial periodicities are almost e qual to

ﬁrst peak.

spatial periodicity is weaker (or absent) than in Fig.16. It seems tha t the
non-coding sequences of real organisms have a random like struct ure.
34
regions again seem to have a random structure.
The fact that the power spectrum corresponding to protein-cod ing se-
quences exhibits a very sharp periodicity at λ∗≃3, whereas the one corre-
sponding to non-coding sequences does not, has already been rep orted in the
literature [21]. Nonetheless, in these previous works the power spe ctrum of
the “bare” genetic sequences is analyzed, namely, without conside ring any
kind of interaction potential or dynamical behavior. What we have s hown
here, though, is that this “structural” periodicity around three t ransforms
into adynamical periodicity in the motion of the particle along the polymer.
6.3 Extended chain: M=10
The most interesting dynamics occurs when an extended chain is inte racting
with the polymer. In such a situation, a collective interaction prevails . At
every moment there are several contact points between the cha in and the
polymer. As we have already pointed out, collective interaction betw een the
chain and the polymer gives rise to a widely ﬂuctuating probability func tion
Pm(d). The sameoccurs with thepower spectrum ofthe velocity ofthe c hain
along the polymer. However, these ﬂuctuations, far from being an noying,
produce a much richer dynamical behavior than in the single-monome r-chain
case.
In Fig.18 we show the power spectra of the velocity of the chain along
the polymer for two diﬀerent random realizations of monomer charg es in
the chain. The charges in the polymer were the same in both cases. T hese
graphs were constructed with a polymer 500 monomers in length and a 10-
monomer chain. The parameter values used were σ= 0.5 andα= 1. Also,
the charge values were, as above {±1,±2}. From the ﬁgure, it is apparent
that thepower spectrum ofthe velocity exhibits a very well deﬁned dominant
frequency, even though the charges in both the polymer and the chain were
assigned at random . The power spectrum in Fig.18a presents a dominant
frequency corresponding to a spatial periodicity λ∗≃2, whereas the corre-
sponding periodicity in the power spectrum shown in Fig.18b is λ∗≃3. We
should explain this diﬀerence.
The power spectrum appearing in Fig.18a was constructed by using a
polymer and a chain whose associated probability function P4(d) has the
same shape as the one of Fig.12a. Namely, for this system the proba bility
function has a very high value at d∗= 2. On the other hand, the power

bard≃2, whereas in (b) the probability function was as in Fig.12b with
d∗= 3 and ¯d≃3. In the extended-chain case, there is a ﬁnite correlation

spectrum in Fig.18b corresponds to a system whose probability func tion has
avery sharppeakat d∗= 3, astheoneshowninFig.12b. Fromournumerical
simulations, we can conclude that whenever the probability function has a
sharp maximum at a distance d∗, the power spectrum of the velocity also
presents a sharp peak corresponding to a spatial periodicit yλ∗=d∗.
As we have seen, in the collective-interaction case the most probab le con-
ﬁgurations are those in which the probability function P4(d) has its highest
value atd∗= 3 (see Fig.13). Therefore, if we assign at random the monomer
charges in the polymer and in the chain, with high probability we will come
up with a dynamics possessing a very well deﬁned periodicity: the cha in will
move along the polymer in “jumps” whose length is nearly three monom ers.
7 Summary and discussion
The results presented throughout this work suggest a possible sc enario for
the origin of the three base codon structure of the genetic code. In this sce-
nario, primitive one dimensional molecular machines, initially with a rando m
structure, exhibited a regular dynamics with a “preference” for a movement
in steps of three bases. By “steps” we mean a slowing down of the ve locity
of the chain along the polymer, nearly every three monomers (see F ig.14b).
Even in the simplest case in which the chain consists of only one monome r,
the above dynamical regularity is apparent. We can think of the dyn amics
of primitive molecular machines as being “biased towards three”.
The preceding property is quite robust inasmuch as it hardly depend s on
the particular kind of interaction between the polymer and the chain . On
one hand, the kind of electrostatic potentials we have used is repre sentative
of the actual interaction potentials between particles occurring in Nature.
These potentials are characterized in our model by the parameter α. We
have also seen that the distribution distances between neighboring maxima
and minima along the interaction potential, characterized by the pro bability
function Pm(d), does not depend on this parameter (for small values of σ),
i.e. it will be the same whether the interaction is coulombian or dipolar or
of any other (electrostatic) type.
On the other hand, the spatial distribution of interaction potentia l min-
ima also does not depend on the particular values of the monomer cha rges
{qj}and{pi}, as long as these values are of the same order of magnitude. An
37
important feature that the charges must comply with is that they t ake more
than two diﬀerent values. This allows for an order relation to be esta blished
among the diﬀerent types of monomers, leading to a maxima and minima
structure of the interaction potential. The probability function Pm(d), which
givestheprobabilityoftwo consecutive minima beingseparatedbyad istance
d, only depends on m, namely, onthe number of diﬀerent types of monomers.
Asmincreases, the mean distance ¯dbetween consecutive potential minima
approaches three. Nevertheless, in the particle (single-monomer -chain) case,
the most probable distance is d∗= 2 (form >2).
Stillinthisparticlecase, considerablechangestakeplacewhenthec harges
alongthepolymer areassignedincorrespondence withprotein-cod inggenetic
sequences of real organisms. In this case, not only is the mean dist ance¯d
between neighboring potential minima nearly three, but also the mos t prob-
able one, d∗, happens to be three. This is a remarkable property of protein-
coding sequences, perhaps acquired throughout evolution. Furh termore the
fact that this “reﬁnement” is absent in non-coding sequences of r eal organ-
isms, strongly suggests that it is a consequence of the dynamical p rocesses
involved in the protein synthesis mechanisms.
This interpretation is supported by the results obtained when the dynam-
icsof the particle moving along the polymer is considered. In the random
sequence case, there are dominant frequencies in the power spec trum of the
particle velocity related with the spatial regularities of the interact ion po-
tential. Moreover in the protein-coding sequence case, the power spectrum
of the velocity shows a very well deﬁned periodicity corresponding a lmost
exactly to a spatial distance λ∗= 3. Again, this behavior does not occur
for non-coding sequences of real organisms, which are not involve d in the
translation processes.
A richer dynamics emerges when the chain is composed of several mo -
nomers. In this, more realistic, collective-interaction case, the pr obability
function Pm(d) presents very wide ﬂuctuations, depending on the particular
assignmentofmonomerchargesinthechain. Nevertheless, themo stprobable
conﬁgurations are those for which the probability function has its h ighest
value at d∗= 3. For these conﬁgurations, the power spectrum of the chain
velocity along the polymer exhibits a very well deﬁned spatial periodic ity at
λ∗≃3.
Our results suggest an origin of life scenario in which primordial molec-
ular machines of chains moving along polymers in quasi one-dimensiona l
38
geometries, that eventually led to the protein synthesis processe s, were bi-
ased towards a dynamics favoring the motion in “steps” or “jumps” of three
monomers. The higher likelyhood of these primitive“ribosomes” may h ave
led to the present ribosomal dynamics where mRNA moves along rRNA in a
channel conformed by the ribosome. Dynamics may have acted in th is sense
as one of the evolutionary ﬁlter favoring the three base codon com position
of the genetic code.
