We propose a simple experiment to study delocalization and e xtinction in inhomogeneous bio-
logical systems. The nonlinear steady state for, say, a bact eria colony living on and near a patch
of nutrient or favorable illumination (“oasis”) in the pres ence of a drift term (“wind”) is computed.
The bacteria, described by a simple generalization of the Fi sher equation, diﬀuse, divide A→A+A,
dieA→0, and annihilate A+A→0. At high wind velocities all bacteria are blown into an un-
favorable region (“desert”), and the colony dies out. At low velocity a steady state concentration
survives near the oasis. In between these two regimes there i s a critical velocity at which bacte-
ria ﬁrst survive. If the “desert” supports a small nonzero po pulation, this extinction transition is
replaced by a delocalization transition with increasing ve locity. Predictions for the behavior as a
function of wind velocity are made for one and two dimensions .

I. INTRODUCTION AND RESULTS
Bacterial growth in a petri dish, the basic experiment of microbiolog y, is a familiar but interesting phenomenon.
Depending on the nutrient and agar concentration, a variety of int riguing growth patterns have been observed [1–4].
Some regimes can be modeled by diﬀusion limited aggregation, others b y Eden models, and still others exhibit ring
structures or a two-dimensional modulation in the bacterial densit y. At high nutrient concentration and low agar
density, there is a large regime of simple growth of a circular patch (a fter point innoculation), described by a Fisher
equation [5], and studied experimentally in Ref. [1].
Of course, most bacteria do not live in petri dishes, but rather in inh omogeneous environments characterized by,
e.g., spatially varying growth rates and/or diﬀusion constants. Oft en, as in the soil after a rain storm (or in a sewage
treatment plant), bacterial diﬀusion and growth are accompanied by convective drift in an aqueous medium through
the disorder. By creating artiﬁcially modulated growth environment s in petri dishes, one can begin to study how
bacteria (and other species populations) grow in circumstances mo re typical of the real world. More generally, the
challenges posed by combining inhomogeneous biological processes w ith various types of ﬂuid ﬂows [6] seem likely to
attract considerable interest in the future. The easiest problem t o study in the context of bacteria is to determine
how ﬁxed spatial inhomogeneities and convective ﬂow aﬀect the simp le regime of Fisher equation growth mentioned
above.
A delocalization transition in inhomogeneous biological systems has re cently been proposed, focusing on a single
species continuous growth model, in which the population disperses v ia diﬀusion and convection [7]: the Fisher
equation [5] for the population number density c(x,t), generalized to account for convection and an inhomogeneous
growth rate, reads [7,8]
∂c(x,t)/∂t=D∇2c(x,t)−v·∇c(x,t)
+U(x)c(x,t)−bc2(x,t), (1)
whereDis the diﬀusion constant of the system, vis the spatially homogeneous convection (“wind”) velocity, and bis
a phenomenological parameter responsible for the limiting of the con centrationc(x,t) to some maximum saturation
value (by competition processes of the kind A+A→0 [8]). The growth rate U(x) is a random function which
describes a spatially random nutrient concentration, or, for phot osynthetic bacteria, an inhomogeneous illumination
pattern [7]. If U(x) is constant over the entire sample, then the convection term −v· ∇c(x,t) has no eﬀect on the
growth of the bacteria. Only the introduction of a spatial depende nce for the growth rate U(x) makes the convection
term interesting. In the following we consider the simple case of a “sq uare-well potential” shape for U(x), imposing
a positive growth rate aon an illuminated patch (“oasis”), and a negative growth rate −ǫaoutside (“desert”) [9]:

whereWis the diameter of the oasis. Experimentally this could be realized using a very simple setup, which
both illustrates the basic ideas of localization and delocalization, and le ads to interesting further questions. A one
dimensional example is shown in ﬁgure 1, where a solution with photosy nthetic bacteria in a thin circular pipe, or
annular petri dish, is illuminated by a ﬁxed uniform light source throug h a mask, leading to a “square well” intensity
distribution. The mask is moved at a small, constant velocity around t he sample to simulate convective ﬂow. (Moving
the mask is equivalent to introducing convective ﬂow in the system, u p to a change of reference frame [10].) The
bacteria are assumed to divide in the brightly illuminated area (“oasis” ) at a certain rate, but division ceases or
proceeds at a greatly reduced rate in the darker region (“desert ”) outside. As a result, the growth rate in this
continuum population dynamics model is positive in the oasis and small ( positive or negative) in the surrounding
desert region. Using this simple nonlinear growth model, we discuss pr edictions for the total number of bacteria
expected to survive in the steady state, the shape of their distrib ution in space and other quantities, as a function of
the “convection velocity” of the light source.

FIG. 1. Experimental setup: a solution with photosynthetic bacteria in a circular pipe or a thin annular track in a petri d ish,
is illuminated only in a small area, while the rest of the samp le is either kept dark or illuminated with reduced intensity . The
light source is moved slowly around the sample to model conve ctive ﬂow. The bacteria are assumed to divide in the illumina ted
area (“oasis”) at a certain growth rate a >0, and die (or grow modestly) in the remaining area (“desert” ) with growth rate
−ǫa.
It is interesting to consider the class of biological situations discuss ed in this paper in the context of the ”critical
size problem” in population dynamics [11]. In the critical size problem on e asks for the minimal size of habitat for the
survival of a population undergoing logistic growth and diﬀusion, whe re the region is surrounded by a totally hostile
environment, i.e., no drift and an inﬁnite death rate outside the oasis . We show here that the linearized version of the
critical size problem is closely related to a well known problem in quantu m mechanics, and present a generalization of
this problem to include other types of surrounding environments, a s well as the eﬀect of drift. The linearized version
of equation (1) around c(x,t) = 0 reads
∂c(x,t)/∂t=Lc(x,t), (3)
with the linearized growth operator
L=D∇2−v·∇+U(x). (4)
(We discuss later the validity of this linear approximation and compare the results with lattice simulations of the
full nonlinear problem.) For nonzero convection velocity v,Lis non-Hermitian, but it can still be diagonalized by
a complete set of right and left eigenvectors, {φR

Figure 2 shows the complex eigenvalue spectrum with the potential ( 2) for four diﬀerent values of the convection
velocityv, for a one dimensional lattice approximation to (4) (see Appendix A) with periodic boundary conditions.
The derivation of these results is discussed in section II below. At ze ro velocity Lis Hermitian and all eigenvalues
Γnare real. There are bound states (discrete spectrum) and exten ded or delocalized states (continuous spectrum).
At ﬁnite velocities, all except one of the delocalized states acquire a complex eigenvalue. States with positive real
part of the eigenvalue ( ReΓn>0) grow exponentially with time, states with negative real part ( ReΓn<0) decrease
exponentially with time (see Eq. (6)). In a large one dimensional syst em the “mobility edge” [13], which we deﬁne to
be the eigenvalue of the fastest growing delocalized state, (i.e. the rightmost eigenvalue in the complex parabolas of
ﬁgure 2), is located at the overall average growth rate

(up to corrections of order O(1/L) where the system size Lis the mean circumference of the annulus in ﬁgure 1).
In ﬁgure 2, the eigenvalues of the localized states compose the disc rete, real spectrum to the right of the mobility
edge. With increasing velocity these localized eigenvalues move to the left by an amount proportional to v2/4D, and
successively enter the continuous delocalized spectrum through t he mobility edge, which remains ﬁxed. The parabola
broadens in the vertical direction – the imaginary parts of the eigen values of the delocalized states grow by an amount
proportional to v. A given localized right eigenfunction φR
nundergoes a “delocalization transition” when the velocity
reaches a corresponding critical delocalization velocity v=v∗
n, at which its eigenvalue Γ nhas been shifted so far to
the left that it just touches Γ∗. At higher velocities it joins the parabola of eigenvalues describing a c ontinuum of
delocalized states. The ease with which such a delocalization transitio n can be observed experimentally depends on
whether there are growing delocalized eigenstates in the system, i.e . whether the mobility edge has a positive real
value or not.

FIG. 2. Complex nonhermitian eigenvalue spectra (normaliz ed by the diﬀerence of the growth rates inside and outside the
oasisU0=a+ǫa= 1) at velocities above and below the extinction transition . The spectra are extracted from numerical
simulations of the lattice model described in Appendix B, fo r a system of 1000 sites, oasis width W= 20 sites, D= 0.3,
with growth rate U=−0.5 in the desert and U= +0.5 in the oasis, so that the average growth rate is is −0.48 (which is
equal to the mobility edge Γ∗up to ﬁnite size eﬀects). The chosen velocity parameters (in units of the Fisher wave velocity
in the oasis vF= 2√
aD[5]) arev/vF∼0 (circles), v/vF∼0.39 (plus),v/vF∼0.93 (triangles), and v/vF∼1.39 (squares).
The point spectra are slightly oﬀset in the y-direction so as to be able to distinguish the eigenvalues of the localized states
for diﬀerent velocities. As described in the introduction, the mobility edge remains roughly ﬁxed, and the parabola of t he
delocalized eigenvalues opens up as v/vFis increased. The real, localized eigenvalues move to the le ft for higher velocities. At
v/vF≥1.39 all states are delocalized. (This ﬁgure actually only sho ws the part of the spectrum which corresponds to the
continuum problem. The lattice calculation also yields a le ft part of the spectrum – not shown here – which is an artifact o f
the discrete lattice.)
In a large “deadly” desert ( /an}b∇acketle{tU/an}b∇acket∇i}ht ≃ −ǫa<0) all delocalized states die out, because the mobility edge lies to the le ft
of the origin, as in ﬁgure 2. The growth rate of each localized eigenst ateφR
nthen becomes negative at a corresponding
“extinction” velocity vncwhich is smaller than the corresponding delocalization velocity v∗
n. Thus, as convection
is increased, the population dies out before it can delocalize. Later in this paper, we make speciﬁc predictions for
the behavior of populations near the extinction transition, which oc curs forv=v0c> vncfor alln >0, when the
eigenvalue of the localized “ground state” (fastest growing eigenf unction of L) passes through the origin.
If the average growth rate /an}b∇acketle{tU/an}b∇acket∇i}htis positive ( i.efor a small enough desert or a small positive growth rate in an inﬁnite
desert), the mobility edge lies to the right of the origin and the deloca lization transition can indeed be observed at
v=v∗
0where the “ground state” becomes delocalized. One expects to se euniversal behavior near this delocalization
transition, since there is a diverging correlation length in the system , which renders microscopic details irrelevant
for certain quantities. We report predictions (see also [14]), for qu antities such as the dependence of the localization
length on the drift velocity as it approaches the delocalization velocit y, and the shape of the concentration proﬁle
near the transition.
A special (universal) behavior is expected for the spatially average growth rate /an}b∇acketle{tU/an}b∇acket∇i}ht= 0. In this case the delo-
calization and extinction velocities coincide. Figure 3 summarizes the d iﬀerent scenarios in a sketch of the phase
diagram for large systems with ﬁxed well depth U0≡(a+ǫa), tuning the drift velocity, and the average growth
rate/an}b∇acketle{tU/an}b∇acket∇i}ht=−ǫa. Also shown in ﬁgure 3 is a horizontal transition line at /an}b∇acketle{tU/an}b∇acket∇i}ht= 0 separating a small velocity region
(ǫ<0) where localized modes dominate the steady state bacterial popu lation, from one ( ǫ>0) containing a mixture
of localized and extended states. The experimental signature of t his interesting transition, (which could be accessed
by increasing the light intensity for photosynthetic bacteria at ﬁxe d convection velocity) will be discussed in a future
4
publication [14]. It is of course also possible to drive a population extinctat zero velocity simply by lowering the
average growth rate. This special transition at /an}b∇acketle{tU/an}b∇acket∇i}ht=−Ucis indicated at the bottom of ﬁgure 3.

v= 0 for /an}b∇acketle{tU/an}b∇acket∇i}ht=−Uc, whereUc≃U0. The diagram shows that if the growth rate is negative outsid e andinsidethe oasis
(i.e./an}b∇acketle{tU/an}b∇acket∇i}ht<−Uc), then the only possible state is extinction at any velocity . If there is positive growth inside the oasis, but
negative outside, a localized population can survive in the oasis, but only for small enough wind velocities v. Extended states
are present for a small positive growth rate in the desert ( /an}b∇acketle{tU/an}b∇acket∇i}ht>0). In this case localized and delocalized states coexist fo r
small velocities (“mixed phase”), while at large velocitie s all eigenstates are extended, as shown in ﬁgure 6. The groun d state
becomes delocalized at the critical velocity vcwhich marks the phase boundary between the mixed and the exte nded phase.
In section II we give details of the analysis of the one dimensional linea rized problem for inﬁnite and ﬁnite systems
with periodic boundary conditions. In section III some eﬀects of th e nonlinear term are discussed, especially for
experiments near the extinction transition, and in section IV the tw o dimensional case is discussed. The appendices
contain some details on the analytic computation of ﬁnite size eﬀects (Appendix A), a brief discussion of a lattice
model [7] correspondingto the analytic continuum theory (Apppen dix B), and a discussion of dimensionless quantities
measurable in experiments (Appendix C).
II. LINEARIZED GROWTH IN ONE DIMENSION
If the left and right eigenfunctions φR,L
n(x) are localized ( i.e.if the convection velocity is small enough, so that
φR,L
n(x) decays exponentially with the distance from the oasis), one may elim inate the convective term in Eq. (4) via
the transformation
φR,L
n(x) = exp(±v·x/2D)ψn(x) (9)
(+ refers to the right eigenvectors and −to the left eigenvectors). The eigenvalue equation associated with the
linearized growth operator (3) becomes Hermitian [15]
Γnψn(x) =D∇2ψn(x)+U(x)ψn(x)−(v2/4D)ψn(x), (10)
and is equivalent to the familiar square well potential problem much st udied in quantum mechanics. With the
identiﬁcations a+ǫa≡U0/¯h, whereU0is a quantum well depth, and ¯ his Planck’s constant, Γ n+ǫa+v2/4D≡ |E|/¯h,
5
whereEis a quantum energy level, and D≡¯h/2m, wheremis a mass in the equivalent quantum problem, we can use
well known quantum mechanical results [16,17]. The left and right eige nfunctions at ﬁnite velocity are then related to
the eigenstates of the Hermitian problem (10) via the transformat ion (9), while the eigenvalues undergo a rigid shift
Γn(v) = Γn(v= 0)−v2
4D. (11)
A. An Oasis in an Inﬁnite Desert: Localized Populations and t he Extinction Transition
In an inﬁnite one dimensional system, localized solutions for φR,L
n(x) are given by Eq. (9) with [18]

κn=/radicalbig
(Γn(v= 0)+ǫa)/D, (13)
and
kn=/radicalbig
(a−Γn(v= 0))/D, (14)
as can be seen by substituting the above Ansatz for ψ(x) into Eq. (10). Eq. (13) implies
Γn(v= 0) =Dκ2
n−ǫa. (15)
To compute Γ n(v= 0) one matches both ψn(x) and∂ψn(x)/∂xatx=±W/2, which determines the coeﬃcients
Ai,n,Bi,n,i= 1,2, up to an overall multiplicative factor, as well as the eigenvalues {Γn(v= 0)}. When solving the
Hermitian problem one may use the fact that all the eigenfunctions a dmit a well deﬁned parity, i.e., they are odd or
even under the transformation x→ −x. Even integers ncorrespond to bound eigenstates with even parity, where
ψn(x), is symmetric under x→ −x. In such a case one obtains the eigenvalue equation for the quantit y
ζn(Γn)≡knW/2 =W/2/radicalbig
(a−Γn(v= 0))/D, (16)
namely,
cot(ζn) =ζn¯x//radicalbig
1−(ζn¯x)2, (17)
(which is equivalent to cot( knW/2) =kn/κn), with
¯x= 2/radicalbig
D/(a+ǫa)/W= 2/(/radicalbig
k2n+κ2nW). (18)
The dimensionless parameter ¯ xmeasures the ratio of kinetic to potential energy in the equivalent q uantum problem.
For bound eigenstates with odd parity ψ(x), (ψ(x) antisymmetric under x→ −x, denoted by odd n) one obtains
cot(ζn) =−/radicalbig
1−(ζn¯x)2/(ζn¯x). (19)
Thehighesteigenvalue(withitsnodeless,positiveeigenfunction ψ0(x)), correspondstothelargestgrowthrate Re{Γ0},
and is therefore expected to dominate the system in most cases at long times, as seen from Eq. (6). Its eigenvalue
condition (17) for n= 0 leads to [16]
Γ0(v= 0)+ǫa= (a+ǫa)f(¯x), (20)
wheref(¯x) is a monotonically decreasing function such that f(¯x)≃1−π2¯x2/4 for ¯x≪1, andf(¯x)≃1/¯x2for ¯x≫1.
Upon inserting Eq. (20) into the expressions for κnandknone obtains
6
κ0=/radicalbig
(a+ǫa)f(¯x)/D (21)
and
k0=/radicalbig
((a+ǫa)(1−f(¯x)))/D. (22)
When ¯x≪1, the “potential well” is very deep, and one ﬁnds the usual particle in a box result for Γ 0(v), with
correction term proportional to v2arising from the change of variables (9) and (11), namely
Γ0(v)≃(v2
c−v2)/(4D) =a−Dπ2/W2−v2/4D, (23)
with
vc= 2D/radicalbig
(a/D−π2/W2), (24)
κ0=/radicalbig
(a+ǫa)/D−π2/W2 (25)
and
k0=π/W. (26)
For ¯x≫1 one ﬁnds
Γ0(v)≃(v2
c−v2)/(4D) = (a+ǫa)2(W/2)2/D−ǫa−D(v/2D)2(27)
with
vc= 2D/radicalbig
((a+ǫa)W/2)2/D2−ǫa/D, (28)
κ0=/radicalbig
(a+ǫa)2(W/2)2/D2 (29)
and
k0=/radicalbig
(a+ǫa)(1−1/¯x2)/D. (30)
If we take as an eﬀective diﬀusion constant for motile bacteria D= 6·10−6cm2/sec, and a growth rate a= 10−3
/sec in the oasis and a much smaller growth rate outside (0 <|ǫ|<<1), we get for a W= 2cmdiameter oasis,
¯x= 0.077≪1, and an “extinction velocity” vc≃1.5µ/sec, which is comparable to the Fisher wave velocity [5] in the
oasis,vF= 2√
aD= 1.5µ/sec.
B. Finite Size Eﬀects and the Delocalization Transition
An experimental ﬁnite system with periodic boundary conditions is de picted in ﬁgure 1. The eigenvalue equation
forκn(Γn) andkn(Γn) of the corresponding linearized problem of an oasis of width Win a ﬁnite desert of extent
L > W (withLbeing the mean circumference of the circular region in ﬁgure 1), is ob tained using the Ansatz in
Eq. (9) with
ψn(x) =

(A1,nexp(κnx)+A2,nexp(−κnx)),for−L

2<x<W
2,
(C1,nexp(κnx)+C2,nexp(−κnx)),forW
2<x<L
2,(31)
and matching φR,L
n(x) anddφR,L
n(x)/dxat the edges of the well and at the edges of the sample (imposing per iodic
boundary conditions). One ﬁnds the eigenvalue equation [12] (see a lso [19])
2knκn(cosh(Lv/(2D))−cos(knW)cosh(κn(L−W)))
+(k2
n−κ2
n)sin(knW)sinh(κn(L−W)) = 0. (32)
7
Forv/(2D)<Re{κn}, and large L, equation (32) yields
exp(L(v/(2D)−κn)) = (33)
cos(knW)−kn/(2κn)·(1−(κn/kn)2)sin(knW).
The left hand side vanishes in the limit L→ ∞, and the equation reduces to the bound state equations of a single
square well (Eq. (17) for even parity solutions and Eq. (19) for od d solutions). For ﬁnite L, andv/2D<Re{κn}, the
deviation of the “localized” solutions κnandknfrom theirv= 0 values for small vis exponentially small in L [12].
These “localized” or “bound state” solutions, are characterized b y an exponential decay of the bacterial density in
the desert with a correlation length
ξn∼(Re{κn}−v/(2D))−1(34)
and Γn(v) strictly real. However, “delocalized”or“scattering”solutionsals o exist, with Γ n(v) complex, and nontrivial
dependence of κnandknonv, even in the limit of large L. As the velocity is increased, the nth localized eigenstate
becomes delocalized ( ξn→ ∞) at the critical delocalization velocity v∗
ngiven in an inﬁnite system by
v∗
n= 2DRe{κn}. (35)
This implies
ξn∼1/(v∗
n−v)ν(36)
with the (universal) critical exponent ν= 1. We saw that with increasing velocity, the growth rate Re{Γn(v)}for a
given eigenstate decreases. It becomes negative above the corr esponding extinction velocity vnc. We therefore expect
that the delocalization transition for the “ground state” (which te nds to dominate the long time behavior) can be
observed only if v∗
0≤v0c. In the following we discuss the three desert scenarios, ǫ>0,ǫ<0, andǫ= 0.
(1) Forǫ >0 (a “deadly” desert), of big enough size L, one ﬁnds that all delocalized states die out exponentially
with time ( vnc< v∗
n). The population is localized around the oasis at small vand extinct at high v. Figure 2 is a
plot of the eigenvalues Γ( v) in the complex plane for this case, as derived for the lattice model d iscussed in Appendix
B. The lower part of ﬁgure 4 shows a series of proﬁles of the ground state eigenfunction close to the extinction
transition. In small enough systems, such that the total eﬀectiv e growth rate/integraltextL
0U(x)dxis positive, delocalized states
can actually have a positive growth rate even for ǫ>0. (See also Eq. (A2) in Appendix A, with δκ∼O(1/L), and
¯κ∼O(1/L) .) In this case, the system is small enough so that the bacteria can traverse the desert quickly, and on
average won’t die before reenterring the oasis in a circular pipe.
(2) Ifǫ<0, delocalized states should be observable even for very large syst ems, because the “desert” can support
modest growth, although at a much smaller rate than in the oasis if |ǫ| ≪1. Growing delocalized eigenstates are
present, even for v= 0, and the population is a superposition of fast growing localized sta tes and more slowly growing
delocalized ones. As a drift velocity vincreases, the n’th localized eigenstate delocalizes at v=v∗
nwith a positive
growthrate ReΓn(v∗
n)(i.e.v∗
n<vnc). This caseallowsforanexperimentalobservationofthe delocaliza tiontransition:
as the velocity is increased, more and more eigenstates delocalize. T he eigenvalue spectrum for two diﬀerent values of
vis shown in ﬁgure 5 (a) and (b). We can see that the spectrum at the delocalization transition is slightly diﬀerent
depending on whether an “even” eigenfunction or an “odd” eigenfu nction is about to delocalize next (“even” and
“odd” are to be understood in the sense explained in section IIA). I f an odd eigenfunction is about to delocalize
next, there exists a delocalized state which has a purely real growt h rate (at the tip of the parabola in the spectrum
of ﬁgure 5(b)), while no such state exists when an even eigenfunct ion is about to delocalize, as in ﬁgure 5(a). The
essential characteristics of the spectrum are derived in Appendix A.
For experiments, we focus on the delocalization of the ground stat e, since it is the fastest growing eigenstate, which
dominates the system near the oasis. The ground state delocalizes at the highest delocalization velocity v=v∗
0,
i.e.forv > v∗
0all states are delocalized. The lower part of ﬁgure 6 shows a series o f proﬁles of the ground state
eigenfunction close to delocalization. One sees that at the delocaliza tion velocity v∗
0, the correlation length ξ0reaches
the system size. In an inﬁnite system it diverges as in Eq. (36). Near the delocalization transition, we expect certain
quantities to become independent of microscopic details of the syst em. These universal quantities will only depend on
general properties, such as symmetries, dimensions etc.. Simple mo dels that only share these general properties with
the experimental system will be suﬃcient for precise predictions fo r these quantities near the transition. An example
of such a quantity is the critical exponent νin Eq. (36). Details for the square well system and more general ra ndom
systems will be presented in a future paper [14].
(3) Forǫ= 0, the growth rate of the bacteria exactly balances the death ra te in the desert, they only diﬀuse. In this
case the delocalization velocity and the extinction velocities coincide: v∗

for the linear and the nonlinear case. The xcoordinate is normalized by the width Wof the oasis. In the nonlinear case the
populations c(x,v) are divided by the population at zero velocity in the middle of the oasis c(0,0). In the “linear” case, we
simply assume the validity of Eq. (44) and rescale the curves such that their maximum values match those of the nonlinear c ase.
The proﬁles were extracted from a lattice model with 1000 sit es, an oasis of width W= 200 sites, with growth rate U= 0.5
inside the oasis and U=−0.5 outside, and diﬀusion constant D= 30. The velocity parameters are taken to be v/vF= 0 (solid
line),v/vF= 0.93 (dotted), v/vF= 0.98 (dashed), and v/vF= 0.99 (dash-dotted). Close to the extinction transition, wher e
the population is small, the agreement between the nonlinea r and the linear solution becomes quite good. The oasis occup ies
the region |x/W|<0.5 in the ﬁgures.

case the populations c(x,v) are divided by c(0,0), the population in the middle of the oasis, at zero velocit y. Curves for the
“linear” case, were computed as in ﬁgure 4. The proﬁles were e xtracted from a lattice model with 1000 sites, an oasis of wid th
200 sites, with growth rate U= 0.1 inside the oasis and U= 1.1 outside, and large diﬀusion constant D= 300. The velocity
parameters v/vFare taken to be v/vF= 0 (solid line), 0 .17 (dotted), 0 .33 (dashed), 0 .50 (long-dashed), and 0 .83 (dash-dotted).
In both cases the population becomes delocalized at high vel ocities with increasing velocity when the correlation leng th reaches
the size of the system.
C. Delta-Function Potential Well
Results for a delta-function-like oasis in one dimension, can be easily d erived as a special case of the square well
potential, by taking the limit ǫ→0,a→ ∞andW→0 withaW= const≡V0. In this case Eq. (32) simpliﬁes to
κ(cosh(Lv/(2D))−cosh(κL))+V0sinh(κL)/D= 0, (37)
which is the same equation as obtained in [12]. With the identiﬁcation κ≡(−i)Kthe results derived there can be
applied here: the delocalization picture is the same as in ﬁgure 5(a), e xcept that there exists only one (even parity)
bound state solution for Re{κ}>v/(2D). Again two critical velocities vc0andv∗
0emerge, in accordance to the above
discussion for a square well potential.
III. EFFECTS OF THE NONLINEARITY
We can also estimate the eﬀects due to the nonlinear term in equation (1), which leads to a saturation of c(x,t) for
Γn(v)>0. The equation of motion becomes
∂c(x,t)/∂t=Lc(x,t)−bc2(x,t), (38)
withLgiven by Eq. (4). (The coeﬃcient bcan be set to 1 by rescaling the density c(x,t) byb, as in Appendix C.)
The solution can be expressed in terms of the complete set of right e igenstates for the linear problem with new time
dependent coeﬃcients cn(t) with

where the mode couplings are given by [7]
wn,mm′=b/integraldisplay

In general one expects that through the mode couplings the fast est growing eigenstate suppresses the growth rate of
the other eigenstates, provided the corresponding couplings are large enough [7,14]. In the mixed phase of ﬁgure 3 we
expect that the fastest growing bound state suppresses the ot her bound states, and the fastest growing delocalized
state suppresses the other delocalized states [14].
A. Eﬀects of the Nonlinearity at the Extinction Transition
Forǫ >0 (and large enough systems so that/integraltextL
0dxU(x)<0), with velocity vjust below the extinction velocity
v0c, we expect that the growing ground state term c0(t)φR
0(x) dominates the summation (39) for c(x,t). In a ﬁrst
approximation we neglect all cm(t) withm>0 and ﬁnd
dc0(t)/dt= Γ0c0(t)−w0c2
0(t), (42)

with asymptotic behavior lim t→∞c0(t) = Γ0/w0. Thus, the steady state population proﬁle should be given approxi-
mately by
c∗(x) = Γ0φR
0(x)/w0, (44)
where
c∗(x) = limt→∞c(x,t). (45)
The total steady state bacterial population N0is

It follows that
N0≃(Γ0/w0)/integraldisplay

Since Γ 0∼(v−vc)(v+vc), and/integraltextdxφR

extinction transition

Figure 7 shows the total population N0as a function of the convection velocity vfor an oasis in a desert with negative
growth rate, which is large enough so that the average growth rat e is negative also. The data was obtained from a
lattice model for the nonlinear problem (see Appendix A). The display ed convection velocities range from v= 0 to
velocities larger than the extinction velocity v >vc. One can see that N0decreases linearly with v−vcforv→v−
c,
12
as predicted in Eq. (48). Figure 4 shows a series of population proﬁle s for increasing velocity, for the linear case ( i.e.
taking the ground state of the linear problem as a solution for the st eady state), and for the nonlinear case. One can
see that close to the extinction transition the ground state of the linearized growth is an excellent approximation, as
is to be expected since there the bacterial density c(x) becomes small, so that mode couplings other than w0induced
by the nonlinear term bc2(x) become small relative to the linear terms.

with 100 grid points (see Appendix B). The diﬀusion constant isD= 3., the width of the oasis is W= 20, the growth rate
is -0.9 outside the oasis and 0.1 inside. The coeﬃcient of the nonlinear term in the equation of motion is b≡1. The average
growth rate is −0.7<0 for this system, so that v0c<v∗
0, and the system goes through the extinction transition at v/vF≃0.65,
above which N0(v) vanishes. The approximation vc≃vFmentioned in the text does not work quite as well here as in oth er
cases because the condition ¯ x≪1 necessary for this approximation is violated weakly for th e model parameters chosen here.
(¯x≃0.35).

for small velocities. The constants depend on U(x) and other nonuniversal details.
C. Eﬀects of the Nonlinearity at the Delocalization Transit ion
Figure 6 shows the same information as ﬁgure 4 for the delocalization transition for an oasis in a background with
positive growth rate. One can see that the linear approximation ( i.e.taking the ground state of the linear problem as
a solution for the steady state), becomes best for high velocities [1 4], when the drift term in the equation of motion
becomes dominant compared to the nonlinear term. Furthermore t he nonlinear solution at low velocities is in the
“mixed phase”, i.e., it is a superposition of extended and localized eigenstates of the sy stem. A decomposition of
13
thev= 0 nonlinear solution into the eigenstates of the system shows [14] t hat its leading contributions are from
the localized ground state eigenfunction and the fastest growing d elocalized eigenfunction. As the drift velocity is
increased, the contribution of localized eigenstates clearly diminishe s. Above the delocalization transition, the steady
state is composed only of delocalized modes.
IV. TWO DIMENSIONS, INFINITE SYSTEM SIZE
Much of the above analysis can be adapted to two dimensions. We aga in use the transformation (9) and consider
a circular oasis of diameter Win Eq. (10). The analysis is straightforward, so we omit most of the d etails. Following
reference [12], the qualitative behavior of non-Hermitian eigenvalue spectra for linearized growth in two dimensions
shouldbe asfollows: Asin onedimension, localizedstatesassociatedw iththe potentialwellwillliein apointspectrum
on the real axis. Extended states, however, will occupy a dense r egion in the complex plane with a parabolic boundary
(see ﬁgure 8). With increasing v, the localized point spectrum will again migrate into the continuum.
ReΓnnImΓ
FIG. 8. Sketch of a complex nonhermitian eigenvalue spectru m in two dimensions with localized and delocalized eigensta tes.
The sketch uses a computation of the spectrum for a delta func tion potential in two dimensions [12], in which case there is only
one bound state (to the right of the imaginary axis). We expec t qualitatively the same result for the ﬁnite two dimensiona l
well discussed in the text, except that multiple bound state s with real eigenvalues will occur, just as in one dimension.
In the localized regime the spatial distribution of bacteria is in the linea r approximation given by the convection-
distorted ground state eigenfunction,
φR,L
0(x) =

C1,0exp(±v·x/2D)J0(kn|x|),for|x|<W/2,
C2,0exp(±v·x/2D)K0(κn|x|),for|x|>W/2,(49)
whereJ0(x) andK0(x) are Bessel functions of order zero [20]. The constants C1,0andC2,0are chosen such that
φR,L
0(x) and its radial derivative are continuous at |x|=W/2. The lowest energy eigenvalue is again given by eq. (20),
but with diﬀerent results for f(¯x) [16]: for ¯x≪1 one ﬁnds f(¯x)≃1−a2
1¯x2wherea1≃2.405 is the ﬁrst zero of J0(a);
for ¯x≫1 one ﬁnds f(¯x)≃¯x2exp(−4¯x2). The behavior of the ground state eigenvalue is thus
Γ0≃a−4D(2.405)2/W2−Dv2/(4D) (50)
for ¯x≪1 and
14
Γ0≃D(4/W2)exp[−16D/(W2(a+ǫa))]−D(v/2D)2(51)
for ¯x≫1. From these results one can compute v0cfor the 2 dimensional case. As in one dimension, one again ﬁnds
forǫ>0 (“deadly” oasis), and large enough systems, that vc0<v∗
0, wherev∗
0/2D≃Re{κ0}, andv0cis the velocity
above which the ground state growth rate Γ 0becomes negative.
Figure 9 shows a contour plot for the spatial distribution of bacter ia in the linearized case at convection velocity
vbelowv0cin 2 dimensions, obtained from equation (49). Although the full nonlin ear two dimensional problem
seems tractable numerically, we expect that close to the extinction transition the curves for the linearized case will
approximate the shape of the steady state, because the ground state dominates sums like that in equation (39).

the circumference of the oasis, the coordinates are given in units of the radius of the oasis. At high velocities the linea r
approximation is expected to give the steady state generate d by the full nonlinear equation, provided that the ground st ate

APPENDIX A: COMPLEX NONHERMITIAN EIGENVALUE SPECTRA FOR FI NITE SYSTEM SIZE
To compute the growth rate Γ n(v) near the delocalization of the nth eigenstate, we set κ=v/(2D)+δκ−i¯κwhere
limL→∞δκ= 0 [12], and take vto be close to the corresponding v∗
n. Upon expanding the right hand side of equation
15
(34) in powers of v−v∗
nandδκ−i¯κ, one obtains:
exp(−L(δκ−i¯κ)) =cn(v−v∗

wherecnisthederivativeoftherighthandsidewithrespectto vatv=v∗

and for odd none ﬁndscn>0. Hence, for even n, andv < v∗
n, one has to leading order δκ≃ln[v/(cn(v−v∗
n))]/L
and ¯κ=π(2m+1)/L, withmany integer. For v>v∗
n,δκ≃ln[v/(cn(v∗

nandv < v∗
n,δκ≃ln[v/(cn(v∗

n, one hasδκ≃ln[v/(cn(v−v∗

¯κ=π(2m+1)/L. Atv=v∗
nin either case, δκ∼O((lnL)/L) and ¯κ∼O((lnL)/L) [12]. For given vandκthe value
of Γ results from above deﬁnition of κ, Γ(v) =Dκ2−ǫa−D(v/(2D))2, and thus
Γ(v) =D(δκ+v/2D)2−D¯κ2−D(v/(2D))2−ǫa
−2iD(δκ+v/2D)¯κ. (A2)
These results are illustrated in ﬁgure 5.
APPENDIX B: NUMERICAL ANALYSIS OF A DISCRETE LATTICE MODEL
A discrete lattice model, originally inspired by the physics of vortex line s [12], has proven very helpful for the
numerical analysis of our problem. The corresponding lattice discre tization (with lattice constant l0) of the nonlinear
equation in ddimensions reads [7]

wherecx(t) is the species population at the sites {x}of a hypercubic lattice, and the {eν}are unit lattice vectors.

continuum model [7]. The subtraction in the ﬁrst term insures that cx(t) is conserved (d
dt/summationtext
xcx(t) = 0) ifU(x) =b=
0. There are two constraints on the mesh size or lattice spacing ℓ0, which ensure that the model correctly describes
the continuum limit for a given eigenstate φR
n, derived from the condition that ℓ0|∇φR
n(x)|/φR
n(x)≪1. For small v
one requires
knℓ0≪1 andκnℓ0≪1. (B1)
For high velocities the condition becomes
vℓ0/(2D)≪1, (B2)
as follows from Eq. (9). The lattice simulations shown in this paper are well within these limits.
APPENDIX C: DIMENSIONLESS QUANTITIES
The equation of motion can be rewritten in dimensionless form, by intr oducing rescaled coordinates, y≡x/W,
whereWis the width Wof the oasis, and rescaled population densities ¯ c≡c/cs, wherecsis roughly the saturation
value of the bacterial density in the oasis (up to O(ǫ)):cs=a/b(see Eq. (1)). One then obtains

Fisher wave velocity vF= 2√
Dain the oasis, which gives the speed at which a Fisher wave [5] would prop agate in
the oasis. The velocity vFalso gives a rough estimate for the velocity at which the extinction tr ansition takes place,
16
in the appropriate parameter regime ( ǫ <0) of the phase diagram of ﬁgure 3. The basic time scale of the syste m is
set by the diﬀusion time W2/D, which is the time it takes a bacterium to diﬀuse across the oasis.

study a continuum (“mean ﬁeld”) approximation to this proce ss. Discreteness, which will only be important very close to
the extinction transition, can be modeled by inclusion of a m ultiplicative Langevin noise term, see, e.g. V. Privman, Tr ends

[9] D. Ben-Avraham in http://xxx.lanl.gov/list/cond-mat , paper number 9806163, gives an exact solution for a related (in-
verse) problem for an inﬁnitely deep single trapat the origin, taking into account discreteness eﬀects for t he processes
A→2AandA+A→A. His problem is equivalent to a solution on half line x>0 with absorbing boundary conditions
atx= 0 and a drift velocity vto the left (towards x= 0). For the mean ﬁeld theory of his model, we expect that the
only change in the spectrum {Γn}due to the drift is the rigid shift Γ n→Γn−v2/4D. In his case, all wave functions are
extended. He observes an extinction transition at a critica l value of the drift velocity.
[10] For a moving mask, as in ﬁgure 1, the Fisher equation read s∂c(x′,t)/∂t=D(∇′)2c(x′,t)+U(x′−vt)c(x′,t)−bc2(x′,t),
wherex′is the coordinate in the laboratory frame where the growth me dium is ﬁxed. Upon transforming to new spatial
coordinates x=x′−vt, in which the mask remains ﬁxed, and then making the replacem entc(x+vt,t)→c(x,t), we
obtain equation (1).
