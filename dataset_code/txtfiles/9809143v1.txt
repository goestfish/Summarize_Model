Abstract
We investigate the behavior of a population genetics model i ntroduced by
(Waxman &Peck, 1998) incorporatingmutation, selection, a ndpleiotropy. The
population is inﬁniteand continuous variation of genotype is allowed. Nonethe-
less, Waxman and Peck showed that if the degree of pleiotropy is large enough,
in this model a nonzero fraction of the population can have id entical alleles.
This ‘condensed mode’ behavior appears in the limit of inﬁni te times.
This paper explores the time-dependence of the distributio n of alleles in this
model. First, the model is analyzed using a recursion techni que which enables
the distribution of alleles to be calculated at ﬁnite times a s well as in Waxman
and Peck’s inﬁnite-time limit. Second, both Waxman and Peck ’s original model
and a related model in which mutations occur continuously ar e mapped onto
problems in quantum mechanics. In both cases, the long-time analysis for the
biological model is equivalent to ﬁnding the nature of the ei genstates of the
quantum problem. The condensed mode appears if and only if th ere is no
bound state in the quantum problem.
We compare the behavior of the discrete- and continuous-tim e versions of
the model. The results for the two cases are qualitatively si milar, though there
are some quantitative diﬀerences. We also discuss our attemp ts to correlate the
statistics of DNA sequence variations with the degree of ple iotropy of various
genes.

1 Introduction
Recently, (Waxman & Peck, 1998) introduced a simple population gen etics model
of an inﬁnite population with a continuous distributions of alleles1incorporating
pleiotropy (one gene aﬀecting several characters of an organism ). They demonstrated
that when the number of characters aﬀected is greater than two , the long-time steady
state solution of their model can have a nonzero fraction of the po pulation with
identical alleles, and that this phenomenon does not occur if the num ber of characters
aﬀected per gene is two or fewer.
In this paper we consider their model and a simple variant of it, addre ssing several
issues. The ﬁrst three issues involve the mathematical analysis of t he theory. First
we study the time evolution of the distribution of alleles. In the model, the initial
distribution of alleles is continuous, and at inﬁnite time there is an inﬁnit ely narrow
(δ-function) peak;2we ask how the distribution of alleles depends on time at long
but ﬁnite times. Second, we describe how to construct time-depen dent solutions by
using an expansion in a sum of functions (Gaussians) particularly pick ed to meet
the requirements of this problem. Third, we examine the relationship between the
model with discrete generations used by Waxman and Peck (where m utations occur
at discrete times, and ﬁtness selection occurs continuously) and a continuous-time
model in which both mutations and ﬁtness selection occur continuou sly. The latter is
a limiting case of the discrete model arising when the time between gen erations gets
very short. We demonstrate that the qualitative behavior of the t wo models is the
same, but that dependence of the behavior on the parameters ca n be diﬀerent in the
two models.
We show that the population genetics models can be mapped onto pro blems in
quantum mechanics, speciﬁcally Bose-Einstein condensation3(de Groot et al., 1950)
and motion of a particle in a central potential.4The mapping onto Bose condensation
is performed on the discrete-time model in the limit that the ﬁtness s election is
very strong so that only organisms with ﬁtnesses very near optimu m survive each
1Waxman and Peck’s model is based on the continuum-of-alleles model of (Kimura, 1965). Other
important investigations of pleiotropic models include (Wagner, 1989 ), (Lande, 1980), (Gavrilets &
de Jong, 1993), and (Turelli, 1985).
2The Dirac delta-function, δ(t), is deﬁned to be a function very sharply peaked around t= 0, but
having a total weight/integraltext
dtδ(t) equal to one. One deﬁnition of such a function is the limit as zgoes
to positive inﬁnity of (2 πz)−1/2exp[−t2/(2z)]. We shall deal with variables /vector xwithNcomponents.
For such variables, δ(/vector x) is deﬁned to be a delta function in the ﬁrst component of /vector x, times one in
the second component, .... In this way, one has/integraltext
dNx δ(/vector x) = 1.(Spanier & Oldham, 1987)

chanics, e.g., (Feynman, 1972).

generation. The mapping onto the quantum particle in a central pot ential applies
more generally. The simplest case has the potential independent of time. This case
corresponds to the a limit of the population model in which ﬁtness sele ction and
mutations both occur continuously. The close relation between the continuous-time
population biology models and Schr¨ odinger’s equation has been explo ited by B¨ urger5
toobtainmanygeneral resultsonthelong-timebehavior ofmodelso fthetypestudied
here. In this paper, we focus on the mapping for a speciﬁc model, wh ich yields a
simple physical interpretation of the emergence of a unique genoty pe, and allows
the extraction of the time-dependence of the ﬁtness peak as well as comparison to
the discrete-time model. We ﬁnd that the behavior is qualitatively iden tical when
the mutations are continuous and when they are discrete, though there are some
quantitative diﬀerences.
We also discuss our attempts to relate the results fromthis model t o the statistical
properties of the sequences that are archived in various sequenc e databases. We
analyze thestatistical properties ofgene sequences tabulated in genetic databases and
attempt to correlate observed variations with estimates of the de gree of pleiotropy of
diﬀerent genes in the databases. The results of these attempts a re inconclusive.
This paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we introduce the theo retical
models. Section 3 presents our analysis of the time evolution of the d iscrete version
of the model, demonstrating that the behavior can be extracted a nalytically in a
limit in which the typical jump caused by mutations is very large. In sec tion 4 we
present our analysis of the continuous-time model. Section 5 conta ins remarks on the
relationshipbetween thecontinuous- anddiscrete-time models. Se ction6presents our
examination of DNA sequence archives and our attempts to correla te the statistics of
documented sequence variations to the degree of pleiotropy of va rious genes. Section
7 recaps our main conclusions. The Appendix contains mathematical details of the
analysis of the time-dependence of the continuous-time model aime d at establishing
the long-time time-dependence.
2 The Models
Onemodel we study is that of (Waxman& Peck, 1998). In this model, the population
is inﬁnite, the phenotypic variation is continuous, each gene aﬀects Ncharacters, and
the eﬀects of diﬀerent genes are uncorrelated (no linkage disequilib rium or epistasis).
The model assumes a very large population of haploid and asexual or ganisms with
discrete generations. Let /vector xbe a continuous vector with Ncomponents which rep-
resents characters which determine the viability of an organism, an dφ(/vector x,t) be the

normalized probability density that an organism in the population has t he characters
given by/vector xat timet. The normalization condition for the probability is given by an
N-dimensional integral as/integraldisplay
φ(/vector x,t)dNx= 1. (1)
At each generation an organism with characters /vector xsurvives viability selection with a
probability proportional to exp( −x2/2Vs). This Gaussian ﬁtness selection will play
an essential role in our solution of the model. Once each generation, a fractionθof
the population mutates; it is assumed that if a mutation occurs, the n the probability
that the mutant takes on the value /vector xgiven the parental value /vector yisf(/vector x−/vector y).
Sinceφ(/vector x,t) is a probability density, it is normalized at every time t. Thus, for
this model, the equation for the time evolution of φ(/vector x,t) is:
Γ(t+1)φ(/vector x,t+1) = (1 −θ)w1(/vector x)φ(/vector x,t)+θ/integraldisplay
f(/vector x−/vector y)w1(/vector y)φ(/vector y,t)dNy ,(2)
where the ﬁtness factor w1(/vector x) is
w1(/vector x) = exp[−x2/2Vs]. (3)
The multiplicative factor, Γ( t+1), in Eq. (2) ensures that the probability, φ(/vector x,t+1)
is properly normalized at every time step. Integrating Eq. (2) over all/vector xgives the
Waxman and Peck result for this normalization:
Γ(t+1) =/integraldisplay
φ(/vector x,t)w1(/vector x)dNx . (4)
We follow Waxman and Peck in using a Gaussian function for the mutatio n proba-
bility:
f(/vector x−/vector y) = (2πm2)−N/2exp[−(/vector x−/vector y)2/2m2], (5)
wherem2describes the variance of the mutant eﬀects for a single characte r.
In addition to this discrete-time model, we will consider a model in which both
mutations andselection occur continuously intime. The relationbetw een the discrete
and continuous-time models can be seen explicitly by noting that the d iﬀerential
equation
∂φ(/vector x,t)

φ(/vector x,t+τ) = exp/bracketleftBigg/integraldisplayt+τ

φ(/vector x,t). (7)

Thus, model Eq. (2) can be written as a diﬀerential equation:
∂φ(/vector x,t)
∂t=/bracketleftBigg
a(t)−x2

φ(/vector x,t)
+θ/summationdisplay
nδ(t−nτ)/integraldisplay
d/vector y f(/vector x−/vector y)[φ(/vector y,t)−φ(/vector x,t)], (8)
whereτis the interval between mutations. Here, a(t) is determined by the nor-
malization requirement of Eq. (1) and δ(t) is the Dirac delta function. In dynam-
ical systems theory, equations with a sum of time-delta functions a re said to be
‘kicked’(Lichtenberg & Liberman, 1992). When the interval betwee n kicks (here τ)
goes to zero, the sum of delta-function is replaced by its time avera ge, so that Eq. (8)
reduces to:
∂φ(/vector x,t)
∂t=/bracketleftBigg
a(t)−x2
2V/bracketrightBigg
φ(/vector x,t)+Θ/integraldisplay
d/vector y f(/vector x−/vector y)[φ(/vector y,t)−φ(/vector x,t)],(9)
where Θ is the rate of mutations per unit time, θ/τ, anda(t) is determined by the
normalization requirement, Eq. (1.)
In the next few sections we calculate the evolution of φ(/vector x,t) for diﬀerent N, with
an emphasis on the behavior near /vector x= 0 at long times. In section 3 we examine the
discrete-time model Eq. (2); section 4 discusses the continuous t ime equation Eq. (9).
In section 5 we discuss the relationship between the results for the continuous and
discrete-time equations.
3 Time Evolution of Discrete Equations
In this section we consider the discrete-time evolution Eq. (2). We w ill solve it by
exploiting the following observation. Suppose at some time t φ(/vector x,t) is a normalized
Gaussian with variance α, so thatφ(/vector x,t) =Gα(/vector x), where6
Gα(/vector x) = (2πα)−N/2exp/bracketleftBigg
−x2
2α/bracketrightBigg
. (10)
Eq. (2) then implies that φ(/vector x,t+ 1) is the sum of two Gaussians. Indeed, at any
ﬁnite timet,φ(/vector x,t) is the sum of ﬁnitely many Gaussians.
To see how this works, notice that Eq. (2) involves the processes o f multiplication
and of convolution with a Gaussian. If one multiplies two Gaussians, on e gets another
Gaussian according to the rule:
Gα(/vector x)Gβ(/vector x) = (γ
2παβ)N/2Gγ(/vector x), where 1 /γ= 1/α+1/β . (11)
6Strictly speaking, αis the variance of one component of /vector x.
5
Convolution has slightly diﬀerent rules. A textbook integration yields the simple
result: /integraldisplay
Gα(/vector x−/vector y)Gβ(/vector y)dNy=Gδ(/vector x),whereδ=α+β . (12)
Instead of doing integrals at each time step, we can write recursion relations for
the evolution of the widths and amplitudes of the Gaussians. We then solve these
equations in the limit Vs≪m2. Our method of solution has similarities with that
used by (Kingman, 1978) on a simpler model.
To perform the calculation explicitly, ﬁrst consider a warm-up proble m—the case
of no mutations ( θ= 0), which is described by the equation:
Γ(t+1)φ(/vector x,t+1) = exp[ −x2/2Vs]φ(/vector x,t), (13)
where Γ(t+1) is deﬁned in Eq. (4). We assume that, at time t,φ(/vector x,t) is a normalized
Gaussian with variance α(t):
φ(/vector x,t) =Gα(t)(/vector x) (14)
The multiplication process of Eq. (11) implies that the value of φ(/vector x,t+ 1) is, once
again a Gaussian of the form Gα(t+1)(/vector x), but that the new value of αis given by
1/α(t+1) = 1/α(t)+1/Vs. This equation for α(t) has the solution:
α(t) =α0
1+α0t/Vs, (15)
whereα0=α(t= 0). Thus the population distribution remains Gaussian, and at
long times, its width scales as |/vector x| ∼t−1/2. As expected, ﬁtness selection continually
narrows the distribution.
Now we examine the full Eq. (2) with θ>0. We ﬁrst calculate φ(/vector x,t= 1), given
thatφ(/vector x,t= 0) is a Gaussian. There are two terms in the equation. Each involves
the multiplication of Gaussians, and the mutation term also involves a c onvolution.
By the rules of Eqs. (11) and (12), φ(/vector x,t= 1) is the sum of two Gaussians of the
form:
φ(/vector x,1) = (1−θ)Gβ1(α)(/vector x)+θGβ2(α)(/vector x), (16)
where the two β’s are given by:
β1(α) =α
1+α/Vs, (17)
β2(α) =m2+β1(α), (18)
It follows immediately that if φ(/vector x,t) is the sum of ﬁnitely many Gaussians, then
φ(/vector x,t+1) is also the sum of ﬁnitely many Gaussians. Explicitly, we write φ(/vector x,t) in
the form:
φ(/vector x,t) =/summationdisplay
iAi(t)Gαi(t)(/vector x), (19)
6
with the normalization condition that/summationtext
iAi= 1. Then φ(/vector x,t+1) can be written:
Γ(t+1)φ(/vector x,t+1) = (1 −θ)/summationdisplay
iBi(t)Gβ1(αi(t))(/vector x)+θ/summationdisplay
iBi(t)Gβ2(αi(t))(/vector x),(20)
with:
Bi(t) =Ai(t)[1+αi(t)/Vs]−N/2, (21)
Γ(t+1) =/summationdisplay
iBi(t). (22)
Eqs. (20-22) simplify considerably when Vs/m2≪1. In this case, the character-
istic width of the mutation probability function, f, is much greater than the width
produced by one step of the ﬁtness narrowing. In this big-mutatio n-jump limit,
β1(m2)≈Vs,β2(m2)≈m2,β1(Vs/n) =Vs/(n+1),β2(Vs/n)≈m2.7(Here,nis any
positive integer.)
Consider the time evolution of an initial distribution consisting of a Gau ssian with
varianceα=m2. After one time step, the distribution splits into two Gaussians, an
unmutated population with variance β≈Vsand a mutated population with variance
β≈m2. After two time steps, the population consists of three Gaussians withβ
values≈m2,Vs, andVs/2. Afternsteps, the population consists of n+1 Gaussians
withβvaluesm2,Vs,Vs/2,..., Vs/n. We deﬁne α0=m2,αi=Vs/ifori≥1. (Note
that theseα’s are time-independent.) If we start with an initial distribution which is
a Gaussian of width much greater than m, then after nsteps, the distribution consists
ofn+ 1 Gaussians with βvaluesα0, ..., α n. We describe the time evolution using
rate equations for the populations in these states. Fig. 1 is a sketc h of the transitions
that can occur between the diﬀerent α’s. Note that at a given time, a state αimakes
transitions to two states, α0andαi+1.
We writeφ(/vector x,t) as:
φ(/vector x,t) =t/summationdisplay
i=0Ai(t)Gαi(/vector x), (23)
where theAi(t) must obey:.
A0(t>0) =θ (24)

Ai−1(t−1) (i>1, t>0), (26)
7Because the newly-mutated population is a Gaussian of width determ ined bym2for any dis-
tribution, this approximation is equivalent to the “house-of-cards ” approximation introduced by
(Kingman, 1978) and investigated in (Turelli, 1984), (Barton & Ture lli, 1989). One can show that
the results derived in this section are robust when this approximatio n is not made, so long as one is
the regime where Vs≪m2.

We have deﬁned Q= (1+m2/Vs)−N/2; note that Q≪1 in the limit we consider.
First consider the ﬁrst two steps of the evolution. Starting with th e initial condi-
tionA0(t= 0) = 1,Ai(t= 0) = 0, one ﬁnds:
A0(t= 1) =θ ,
A1(t= 1) = 1 −θ . (28)
So far not much has happened. But a key thing happens at the next step:
A0(t= 2) =θ ,
A1(t= 2) =θQ(1−θ)
θQ+(1−θ)2−N/2,
A2(t= 2) =(1−θ)22−N/2
θQ+(1−θ)2−N/2. (29)
Note thatA1(t= 2)∝Q≪1. In fact, for any t >2, allAi’s with 0< i < t are
proportional to Q. However, as t→ ∞, the number of these terms diverges. So it
is not obvious whether as t→ ∞a solution exists where A0(t) =θ,At(t) =O(1),
and all other Ai(t)’s are small, which would imply that the Gaussian describing the
unmutated population contains a nonzero fraction of the total po pulation. We will
ﬁnd that such a solution can exist only when N >2.
First we ﬁnd the steady-state solutions in the long-time limit t→ ∞. In steady
state, the time arguments on the Aiand on Γ can be dropped, and the recursion
relations become:
A0=θ (30)
A1=θQv , (31)

, (33)
where we have deﬁned v= (1−θ)/Γ. We explicitly allow for the possibility that the
amplitudeA∞≡limt→∞At(t) is nonzero.
The solution to Eqs. (30-33) is:
A0=θ,
Ai=θQi−N/2vi, i≥1, (34)

. (35)
Note thatv≤1, for otherwise the Aicannot sum to unity, which is required for
normalization of the probability.8Since asvincreases the left hand side of Eq. (35)
monotonically decreases and the right hand side monotonically increa ses, a solution
withA∞= 0 can exist only if θQ/summationtext∞

i+1/parenrightBigN/2>1−θ. Conversely, if this inequality
is not satisﬁed, then we expect A∞>0. SinceA∞∼limt→∞vt, we require v= 1
ifA∞is nonzero. We show below that such a solution is the long-time limit of th e
solution of the time-dependent equations.
First consider the case when A∞∝negationslash= 0. Since the sum in Eq. (35) converges if
N >2, and diverges otherwise, we see that A∞∝negationslash= 0 can occur only if N >2. When
the sum does converge, the unmutated ﬁtness peak, whose amplit ude isA∞and
whose width is given by Eq. (15), can contain a nonzero fraction of t he total weight.
Evaluating Eq. (33) with v= 1, we ﬁnd A∞= 1−θ−θQζ(N/2), whereζ(N/2) is
the Riemann zeta function(Carrier et al., 1983; Abramowitz & Stegun, 1972).
Now we consider the possibility of a solution in which the unmutated pop ulation
constitutes an inﬁnitesimal fraction of the total population as t→ ∞. SinceA∞= 0,
we must have:1−θ
θQ= Φ(N/2,v), (36)
wherev<1 and Φ(a,x) is the polylogarithm function(Lewin, 1981):
Φ(a,x)≡∞/summationdisplay
i=11
iaxi. (37)
Whena >1, Φ(a,x= 1) =ζ(a) is ﬁnite, where again ζ(z) is the Riemann zeta
function. Therefore, for N >2, the the right hand side of Eq. (36) is bounded as
v→1, and a solution exists only if (1 −θ)/(θQ)<ζ(N/2). In theQ≪1 limit that
we have assumed, this happens only when 1 −θis very small also. If this condition
is not satisﬁed, then a nonzero fraction of the population must be in the unmutated
state.

WhenN= 1, the leading order term as v→1 can be calculated by noting that, for
allv <1, Φ(1

The integrals both converge at their lower limits. They also converge at their upper
limits when v <1, but not when v= 1. The behavior near the upper limit can be
used to estimate that, as vapproaches 1,

Now we calculate the function φ(/vector x,t→ ∞).10First we consider the case when φ
has aδ-function piece.
In this regime, as t→ ∞,A0=θ,Ai=θQ(1/i)N/2(i≥1), andA∞, the weight
in theδ−function, is A∞= 1−θ−θQζ(N/2), whereζ(N/2) is the Riemann zeta

Thus we see that when φ(/vector x,t→ ∞) has aδ-function piece, there is in addition a
divergent contribution at small x, proportional to 1 /x2. When the distribution is
smooth, we have A0=θandAi=θQ(1/i)N/2vi(i≥1), andv <1, and we obtain:

The sums that arise here are identical to those that come up in the c alculation of
Bose-Einstein condensation for an ideal Bose gas(de Groot et al., 1950). The weight
in theδ−function in the genotype distribution, A∞, is analogous to the condensate
fraction in the Bose condensation problem. The parameter N, which here describes
the number of traits aﬀected by a mutation, is the number of spatia l dimensions in
the Bose gas calculation. That the superﬂuid fraction must be zero for a Bose gas
in one and two dimensions is a special case of a general result in the th eory of phase
transitions(Mermin & Wagner, 1966), (Hohenberg, 1967), (Fr¨ o lich & Pﬁster, 1981).
We now discuss the time evolution of the population distribution. We be gin with
some qualitative remarks. When v <1, the sum in the solution Eq. (35) converges
geometrically. Therefore, in this regime one expects the approach to thet→ ∞
limit to be exponential. In the regime where a δ−function contribution is present as
t→ ∞, theδ−function is the long-time limit of a Gaussian describing the unmutated
population. The squared width of this Gaussian narrows as 1 /t, so we expect the
approach to the long-time limit to be power-law. These expectations are supported
by the explicit calculation that we now present. We, in fact, show tha t the long-time
corrections to the amplitude of the δ−function are also proportional to 1 /t.
We again write recursion relations describing the transitions betwee n the various
Gaussians, now allowing for explicit time dependence in the Ai(t). Deﬁning v(t) =
11
(1−θ)/Γ(t+1), these recursion relations are, for t>0:
A0(t) =θ , (45)
A1(t) =Qv(t−1)A0(t−1), (46)
Ai(t) =v(t−1)/parenleftbiggi−1

. (48)
For the initial conditions A0(t= 0) = 1 and Ai>0(t= 0) = 0, these recursion relations
have the solution:
Ai(t) =Qt−1/productdisplay
t′=t−iv(t′)/parenleftbigg1

Now we separate out explicitly the term j=t+1; this is reasonable because v(t′= 0)
is larger than all the other v’s by a factor proportional to 1 /Q, yielding:

v(t)=Qθ

Comparison of this result to that of the steady-state analysis (Eq . (34)) reveals that
ast→ ∞the last term on the rhs is just A∞, the amplitude of the δ−function.
Finally, deﬁning γ(t) =/producttextt
t′=1v(t′), we ﬁnd

Recall that at long times v(t) approaches a limit v≤1. Therefore, for large t,
γ(t) =Cγvt, whereCγis a constant, up to corrections that vanish as t→ ∞, and

Whenvis strictly less than unity, the convergence is exponential, as expec ted from
the qualitative argument given above and in agreement with the resu lt from the
12
continuous-time equations below. When lim t→∞v(t) = 1, then, since the second
term on the right hand side is nonzero as t→ ∞, we must have γ(t) =/producttextt
i=1v(t) =
Cδ(t+1)N/2, whereCδis a constant. This implies v(t)→((t+1)/t)N/2∼1+O(1/t).
By calculating the correction to the sum because of this variation in v(t), we ﬁnd that
the amplitude of the δ−function obeys At(t)−A∞∝t−1ast→ ∞. WhenN= 2,
v(t→ ∞) is exponentially close to unity, so that the decay of the amplitude in t he
unmutated peak up to extremely long times is governed by the logarit hmic divergence
of the sum for v= 1. Thus, in this case we expect At(t) to decay logarithmically with
t.
In ﬁgure 2 we plot At(t), the fractionof the populationwhich is unmutated, versus
timetfor the parameter values θ= 0.2 andQ= 0.1, forN= 1, 2, and 3. The curves
were obtained by numerical iteration of the recursion relations Eqs . (45–48), starting
with the initial condition A0(t= 0) = 1 and Ai(t= 0) = 0 for i∝negationslash= 0. We ﬁnd, as
expected, that At(t) decays to zero for N= 1 andN= 2 but not for N= 3. The
scales on the plot were chosen to emphasize the logarithmic decay wh enN= 2.
Tocompute theprobabilityfunction φ(/vector x,t)weﬁrst calculatetheamplitudes Ai(t),
using the recursion relation, and then sum the corresponding Gaus sians (see Eqs. (19)
and (10)) to obtain numerical values of the probability. These resu lts are plotted in
ﬁgures 3, 4, and 5 for the parameter-values θ= 0.2 andQ= 0.1. ForN= 1, see
ﬁgure 3, we plot φ(/vector x,t) against the magnitude of xfor various values of the time,
t. The picture shows a probability distribution which ﬁrst gets narrow er, but then
settles down to a time-independent behavior for the largest times. Also drawn on this
plot is the inﬁnite-time probability, derived from Eqs. (34) and (35). The probability
φ(/vector x,t) settles down to this limiting behavior most slowly near /vector x= 0, where ﬁtnesses
change slowly with /vector x.
ForN= 3, a corresponding calculation shows a probability function which ge ts
more and more peaked as time goes on, see ﬁgure 4. Notice how, for t= 1000,
the peak sticks up sharply from a more slowly varying background. T o see how this
peaking occurs, we plot in ﬁgure 5 a scaled version of ﬁgure 4. In this version, we plot
φs(/vector xs,t) whereφs(/vector x,t) is the result of dividing φ(/vector x,t) by the predicted growth of the
peak, proportional to tN/2, giving us a scaled y-variable φs(/vector x,t) =φ(/vector x,t)t−N/2. The
scaledx-variable is /vector xs=/vector xt1/2. The resulting plot becomes time-independent for large
times and not-too-large values of /vector xs. In this way, we see how the peak continually
gets narrower, and more and more dominates the small- xbehavior.
Now we turn to the question of the role of initial conditions in the beha vior of
discrete-time model. This question is important because the method of solution of
the discrete-time model outlined in this section assumes that the init ial distribution
φ(/vector x,t= 0) is Gaussian. Here we present our arguments why the results of the
13
calculation should not depend sensitively on this choice of initial condit ion.
First, notethat any initial distribution φ(/vector x,t= 0)which has a width much greater
than bothVsandm2will narrow to two Gaussians of widths Vsandm2after one
mutation step. Therefore, the behavior of any broad distribution will be indistin-
guishable from that of a Gaussian of width ∼>m2.
Now we consider more general variation of the initial conditions by ex amining the
time-dependent Eq. (51). Every term in the sum arises from a muta tion event at
some time t≥0; changing the initial conditions changes only the last term on the
right hand side. In the t→ ∞limit, the the amplitude of the δ−function is obtained
by subtracting from unity the fraction of the population which has m utated at some
time. The long-time limit, v, does not depend on the initial condition; to see this,
notethat either v= 1, inwhich case A∞isobtainedby thesubtractionjust described,
or elsev<1, in which case A∞= 0 and the amplitudes of all the terms that depend
on the initial conditions vanish exponentially. Therefore, the initial c onditions do not
aﬀect either the presence or absence of the δ−function or its steady-state amplitude
when it is present.
4 Continuous-Time Equations
In this section we consider the continuous-time evolution described by Eq. (9). In
(B¨ urger & Bomze, 1996) it is shown that there is a unique time-indep endent solution
ast→ ∞and the possible solutions are classiﬁed using general properties of linear
operators(Reed & Simon, 1972). Our results for the long-time limit a re consistent
withtheirs. Inaddition, ourapproachenablesustointerpretsimply theemergence(or
not) of the δ−function peak as well to address the time-dependence of the appr oach
to thet→ ∞limit.
We proceed by Fourier transforming Eq. (9). We deﬁne the quantit yn(/vectork,t) =/integraltextdNx φ(/vector x,t)exp[i/vectork·/vector x] and obtain:
∂n(/vectork,t)
∂t=/bracketleftbigg
a(t)+1
2V∇2
/vectork/bracketrightbigg
n(/vectork,t)−Θ[1−f(/vectork)]n(/vectork,t), (54)
wheref(/vectork) is the Fourier transform of Eq. (5):
f(/vectork) = exp[−m2k2/2]. (55)
We must also specify, in addition to the initial conditions, two boundar y con-
ditions. One boundary condition is determined by the normalization re quirement/integraltextdNx φ(/vector x,t) = 1, which yields:
n(/vectork= 0,t) = 1. (56)
14
Thesecond boundaryconditionisthat n(/vectork,t)≤1forall/vectork, whichinparticularimplies
that it cannot diverge as /vectork→ ∞. This follows from combining the normalization
condition with the non-negativity requirement φ(/vector x,t)≥0:
n(/vectork,t) =/integraldisplay
dNx ei/vectork·/vector xφ(/vector x,t)≤/integraldisplay
dNx φ(/vector x,t) = 1. (57)
We now solve this equation in the limit of long times. Since as t→ ∞bothnand
abecome independent of time, we must solve:
/braceleftbigg
−1
2∇2
/vectork−(ΘV)f(/vectork)/bracerightbigg
ψ(/vectork) =Eψ(/vectork), (58)
whereψ(/vectork)≡limt→∞n(/vectork,t) and the eigenvalue E=V(limt→∞a(t)−Θ). Eq. (58)
is just the time-independent Schr¨ odinger equation(Schiﬀ, 1968) . The parameter N,
the number of characters aﬀected by each mutation, here is inter preted as the spatial
dimensionality. As shown in (B¨ urger & Bomze, 1996, and reference s therein) and
as discussed here in the Appendix, the long-time solution to the popu lation biology
model is given by the lowest energy eigenstate of this Schr¨ odinger equation.
The kinetic energy term −1
2∇2
/vectorkin Eq. (58) comes from the ﬁtness selection. This
term, which in /vector x-space causes the distribution to become narrower and narrower ,
acts to cause it to become wider and wider in /vectork-space. The potential energy term
−ΘVf(/vectork) comes from the mutations. This potential is constant at large k, and has
an attractive piece at small k. If we assume that the potential has a characteristic
scale ink, so thatf(/vectork) =F(m/vectork) (clearly the ﬁtness function considered here is of this
form), thenwecandeﬁne /vector z=m/vectorkandwritetheSchr¨ odinger equationindimensionless
form: /braceleftbigg
−1
2∇2
/vector z−/parenleftbiggΘV
m2/parenrightbigg
F(/vector z)/bracerightbigg
ψ(/vector z) =˜Eψ(/vector z), (59)
where˜E=E/m2. This equation makes it clear that the nature of the behavior
depends only on the single parameter (Θ V/m2).
If only the selection (kinetic energy) term were present, the solut ions to Eq. (58)
consistent with the normalization condition φ(/vectork) = 1 are
ψ(/vector z) = exp[i/vector p·/vector z], (60)
where/vector p= ˆz√
2˜E, and ˆzis a unit vector along /vector z. To be consistent with the boundary
conditions, we require ˜E≥0. The ground state eigenstate thus has ˜E= 0, so that
ψ(/vector z) = 1. Fourier transforming this result, we see that in the absence o f mutations, at
t=∞the entire population has the same genotype. This result is consiste nt with our
calculation in the previous section demonstrating that in the absenc e of mutations
the variance of φ(/vector x,t) narrows in proportion to 1 /time.
15
So now we consider the eﬀects of adding the potential arising from t he mutation
term. This potential is attractive, so that the question we must ad dress is whether
the ground state eigenstate remains extended ( ψ(/vector z)→constant as |/vectork| → ∞) or
whether it results in a bound state with ˜E <0, which has ψ(/vector z)→0 exponentially
inkas/vectork→ ∞. In the latter case, the real-space distribution φ(/vector x) is smooth as
/vector x→0. Therefore, if there is a bound state, then only an inﬁnitesimal fr action of the
population is unmutated, whereas if there are no bound states, th en a ﬁnite fraction
of the population has a unique genotype.
It has been proven for the Schr¨ odinger equation that any attra ctive potential, no
matter how small, will lead to a bound state for N≤2(Simon, 1976). Thus, the
population distribution in real space φ(/vector x,t→ ∞) must be smooth for N≤2. When
N >2boundstatesonlyappearifthepotentialislargeenough(Θ Vs/m2>CN,where
CNis of order unity)(Schiﬀ, 1968). Therefore, in this case, if the pot ential is small
(weakmutationeﬀects), thenthegroundstateremainsextende d:ψ(/vectork)→constant as
/vectork→ ∞, and the real space distribution φ(/vector x) has aδ−function piece. If the potential
is large (strong mutation eﬀects), then there is a bound state, an d the distribution
φ(/vector x) is not singular at small /vector x.
If all the states are extended, then as |/vectork| → ∞the lowest energy state obeys
∇2
/vectorkn(/vectork) = 0 and has the form n(/vectork)→A+Bk−(N−2), whereAandBare coeﬃcients
determined by matching to the solution in the small |/vectork|region.11
For almost all potentials both AandBare nonzero; Fourier transforming the
term proportional to Byields:
B term∝/integraldisplay
dΩ/integraldisplay∞
0dk kN−1eikxcos(θ)k−(N−2)∝x−2. (61)
(Here,/integraltextdΩ is the integral over angles.) Thus, just as in our discrete-time solu tion,
we ﬁnd associated with a δ-function at /vector x= 0 a power-law divergence at small x,
φ(/vector x)∝x−2.
Inthe regimewhere the groundstateisbound, there isa ﬁniteener gy gapbetween
the ground state and the excited states, which implies that the the long-time limit is
approachedexponentially intime. Whenthereisnoboundstate, the energyspectrum
of the Schr¨ odinger equation is continuous, which leads to power-la w convergence to
the long-time limit. These points are discussed in greater detail in the Appendix.
11This form can be veriﬁed for all Nby several means, the most straightforward being direct
evaluation using Cartesian coordinates. A more elegant method is to note that we are looking for a
function gwhichsatisﬁes0 = ∇2g= div·gradg. Since grad gis a current /vectorjthat is angle-independent
and obeys div /vectorj= 0, then/integraltext

must have j∝r−(N−1), so that g∝r−(N−2).

5 Relation between the continuous-time and the
discrete-time models
In this section we discuss the similarities and diﬀerences between the results of our
discrete-time analysis valid when Vs/m2≪1 and those of the continuous-time anal-
ysis. The basis of our discussion is Eq. (8), which can be used to desc ribe both
cases.
Qualitatively, the discrete and continuous models exhibit very similar b ehavior.
They both lead to only smooth distributions (a “normal” phase) for N≤2, and
forN >2 display a transition as the mutation rate is decreased between the normal
phase and a “condensed” phase, where a ﬁnite fraction of the pop ulation has a unique
genotype. In both models, the convergence to the long-time limit is p ower law in
the condensed phase and is exponential in the normal phase. Howe ver, there are
quantitative diﬀerences between the two models, particularly the d etailed dependence
on model parameters.
Inthecontinuous-timemodel, theformofEq.(59)makesitclearth atthebehavior
depends only on the single parameter Θ V/m2. In contrast, the discrete model that
we solve in the limit m2/Vs≫1 (Eqs. (24-26)) depends on two parameters: Q=
(1 +m2/Vs)−N/2andθ. ForN >2, the discrete model might or might not have
a condensate, depending on the value of the ratio θQ/(1−θ). In this regime, the
continuous-time model is always in the condensed phase.
We use Eq. (8) to discuss the relation between the continuous- and discrete-time
models. One can Fourier transform this equation (as we did in section 4 for the
continuous-time model) and interpret the result as a quantum-mec hanical problem
of a particle in a potential which is applied only at the discrete times t=nτas in
Eq. (8).12
The discrete model has two parameters while the continuous model has only one,
since Eq. (8) depends not just on the mean mutation rate Θ but also onτ, the time
between mutation events. Thus, in principle the discrete-time mode l has one more
parameter than the continuous-time one. If τis increased by a factor of two, then the
productθV(θthe mutation probability per generation and Vthe viability selection
parameter) remains constant, but Vitself is halved. The analysis in section 3, which
is valid when V/m2is very small, and hence in the limit when τis very long, yields
a solution in which that both θandV/m2enter explicitly and not just as a product.
Nonetheless, two models have very similar outcomes.
12We take the limit where a very strong potential is applied for a very sh ort time at each tn=nτ.

6 Comparison with sequence database statistics
Here we present our investigations of the statistical properties o f DNA sequences
archived in genetic databases. The aim is to see if observed sequenc e variability of
a gene is correlated with its degree of pleiotropy. The focus in this se ction is on a
qualitative prediction of the model, that genes with a high degree of p leiotropy should
haveanarrowerdistributionofallelesthanthosethataﬀectonlyon etrait. Thistrend,
which is consistent with the mathematical results of the previous se ctions, is easy to
understand: if a gene of high ﬁtness is pleiotropic, then because ea ch mutation aﬀects
several characters independently, the chances are high that a g iven mutation leads to
a large ﬁtness decrease.
Our ﬁrst test for possible correlation between degree of pleiotrop y and the proba-
bility distribution describing genetic variation is simply to count the num ber of natu-
rally occurring variants of various genes in the Drosophila database FlyBase(FlyBase,
1998). We choose to include naturally occurring alleles, including spon taneous muta-
tions arising in laboratory stocks, of the genes analyzed. Mutagen -induced variants
are not included, since there is no evidence that they exist in natura l populations.
Table 1 shows data for nine genes: brown,cinnabar ,ecdysone receptor ,engrailed ,
fork head ,hairless,notch,vestigial , andwhite. The number of naturally occur-
ring variants is tabulated together with the length of the primary tr anscript and the
approximate length of the genomic region encompassing the gene an d its ﬂanking reg-
ulatory regions. Transcript and genomic lengths are taken from th e full-format gene
reports in FlyBase. For genes with multiple transcripts, we report t he length of the
longest described transcript. When the full gene report does not include the genomic
length, this is estimated from the FlyBase molecular map of the gene. The number
of variants per gene is normalized both by the transcript length and by the genomic
length. In both cases, the values range over approximately three orders of magnitude.
We estimate the degree of pleiotropy of each of the listed genes acc ording to the num-
ber of tissues/structures and developmental stages in which the genes are expressed.
This ordering is admittedly arbitrary to some extent, but few would a rgue with the
conclusion that fork head (encoding a transcription factor essential for development
of the midgut) and engrailed (encoding a homeotic gene establishing segmentation)
are more pleiotropic than the eye color mutants cinnabar ,white, andbrown. Inspec-
tion of Table 1 reveals a clear inverse correlation between estimated pleiotropy and
number of variants/transcribed length or variants/genomic lengt h. This relationship
is consistent with the prediction of Waxman and Peck’s model.
A weak point of this approach is that other factors besides degree of pleiotropy
could lead to the observed diﬀerences in the number of variants. Fo r instance, even
18
two genes which only aﬀect single traits could have vastly diﬀerent va riabilities, if
the traits have greatly diﬀerent eﬀects on overall ﬁtness. For ex ample, a gene that
controls eye color may well have a much smaller overall eﬀect on ﬁtne ss than a gene
that controls a crucial developmental function. In the population genetics model,
diﬀerences of this type are reﬂected by diﬀerent values of the ﬁtn ess parameter Vs.
Within the model, diﬀerences in overall variability caused by changing Vscan be
distinguished from those caused by changing the degree of pleiotro pyNbecause they
yield very diﬀerent functional forms for the distribution function φ(/vector x). However,
countingmutationsyieldsnoinformationaboutthefunctionalform ofthedistribution
function and thus cannot be used to distinguish between the mecha nisms.
Our second strategy for relating degree of pleiotropy to statistic s of archived DNA
sequences aims to obtain information about the form of the probab ility distribution
for various genes. It assumes that two genetic variants whose se quences are highly
similar in sequence space code for genes that are close together in ﬁ tness space. We
use the BLAST 2 sequence similarity search tool(Altschul et al., 1997) to search
the GENBANK and EMBL DNA sequence databases13against the 8 gene sequences
listed in Table 2. These databases contain sequences of genes from many organisms,
though a preponderance of the sequences are from humans. Give n a target sequence,
BLAST 2 generates a list of matching sequences along with scores wh ich measure
the degree of similarity. Because the maximum possible score for a giv en sequence is
larger for longer sequences, we avoided examining genes that were either very short or
very long. As can be seen in table 2, the lengths of the sequences ex amined varied by
less than a factor of ten. Only genes were used whose list of matche s was truncated
because the score fell below the cutoﬀ value of 40; no genes were u sed whose match
list was truncated because the number of matching sequence exce eded BLAST 2’s
maximum number of matches of 500. As shown in table 2, the number o f matches
obtained also varies by roughly an order of magnitude for the genes in the table, and
is not obviously correlated with the length of the gene.
High BLAST 2 scores correspond to sequences which match the sea rch sequence
the most closely. The scores range from roughly 104(a sequence matching itself) to
the default cutoﬀ of 40. We assume that this score is inversely corr elated with the
evolutionary distance between the input gene and the retrieved se quences, so that
a gene with a high fraction of matches with low scores has a broader p robability
distribution φ(x) than a gene with more matches with high scores. Thus, if all the
matches tend to be very good, the gene is considered to be less var iable than one
with many poor matches. We examine the statistics of the closeness of the matches,
13These databases and the BLAST 2 search tool are maintained by th e National Center for
Biotechnology Information (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).
19
in particular the fractions of the total number of matches that fa ll into given ranges
of scores.
Figure6isaplotofahistogramofthefractionofthematchesinagive nscorerange
obtained versus the inverse of the score for several genes. We d o observe signiﬁcant
variability between these genes; for example, cytochrome P-1-450 , which codes for a
general-purpose antioxidant expressed in many tissues and is thus plausibly highly
pleiotropic, has relatively many very good matches compared to rhodopsin , which
is quite speciﬁc, coding for a protein essential for vision. However, we cannot claim
that there is an unambiguous correlation between degree of pleiotr opy and these
plots. For example, HOX A1 has many poor matches, where it might be expected to
be pleiotropic, since it is essential to many developmental functions . Thus, though
interesting variations in the statistics of DNA sequences for diﬀere nt genes are found,
we have not been able to demonstrate convincingly a correlation bet ween degree of
pleiotropy and these statistical variations.
The behavior of HOX A1 can be explained by a process of repeated duplication
anddivergenceover thecourseofevolution. Manyoftheretrieve dgeneshaveassumed
distinct but related developmental functions. The BLAST 2 analysis presented here
does not account for a shift in score distributions arising from diver gence among
members of gene families and superfamilies. Another fundamental d iﬃculty with our
analysis is illustrated by the case of alpha-tubulin , which codes for a protein vital to
the formation of microtubules. On the one hand, microtubules are e xpressed in many
diﬀerent tissues, but on the other hand, all its functions arise fro m similar structural
properties. Thus, one could categorize alpha-tubulin as either highly pleiotropic (since
it is expressed in many tissues) or as non-pleiotropic (since the func tion is similar
everywhere where it is expressed). In short, though degree of p leiotropy is deﬁned in
the populations genetic model, it is not clear how to quantify it in terms of biological
function.
There are several additional diﬃculties and ambiguities inherent in co mparisons
between genome sequence data and population genetics models of t he type consid-
ered here. First, the database scores are based on the quality of sequence alignments,
whereas the population genetics models deﬁne distances in terms of ﬁtness, which is
a phenotypic quantity. Fitness distance and evolutionary sequenc e distance may be
quite diﬀerent; for example, point mutations at diﬀerent locations m ay range in eﬀect
from unobservable to lethal. However, even if there is not a single de ﬁnite relation-
ship between sequence distance and ﬁtness distance, so long as th ese quantities are
positively correlated with each other, meaningful results may be ob tained. Variabil-
ity in the relation between the distances will result in noisy data, but d iﬀerent genes
are all subject to similar uncertainties. Therefore, it is plausible to h ope that, if sig-
20
niﬁcant diﬀerences between the sequence variability of two genes a re observed, they
reﬂect diﬀerences in the ﬁtness distribution φ(/vector x) of the population genetics models.
Another limitation of our analysis is that we consider the ﬁtnesses of alleles as ﬁxed.
This is not necessarily the case, as many gene products function as components of
multi-protein structures or pathways(Lewontin, 1974), (Dover & Flavell, 1984). This
dependency of the ﬁtness value of a speciﬁc sequence variant on t he remainder of
the genotype is manifested explicitly by the existence of epistatic int eractions (e.g.,
(Fijneman et al., 1996), (van Wezel et al., 1996)).
In addition, one may worry that the population genetics model we ha ve used
involves a continuously varying phenotype, whereas sequence var iations are discrete.
However, because genes are thousands of base pairs long, there is still a huge range
of variability, and the use of a continuum model is therefore reason able.
Finally, as mentioned above, pleiotropy itself is deﬁned in terms of phe notypic
ﬁtness, and it is not clear how to create an independent measure th at enables one to
assign objectively the degree of pleiotropy Nto a given gene. This is a serious fun-
damental diﬃculty that must be overcome if one is to make meaningfu l quantitative
statistical analysis of the possible correlations between the seque nce statistics and the
degree of pleiotropy.
7 Discussion
In this paper we have analyzed some variants of a population biology m odel incorpo-
rating selection, mutation, and pleiotropy. We have focussed on un derstanding the
circumstances under which at long times a nonzero fraction of the p opulation has a
unique genotype, and on characterizing the time dependence of th e population distri-
bution in this regime. We have analyzed both the discrete-time model of (Waxman
& Peck, 1998) as well as an associated continuous-time model. We ﬁn d:
1. In both the discrete and continuous-time models, a unique genot ype can emerge
only when N, the number of characters aﬀected by each gene, is greater tha n
two, a result in agreement with (Waxman & Peck, 1998). For any N >2,
the inﬁnite-time population distribution φ(/vector x,t→ ∞) contains a δ−function
contribution when the mutation rate is nonzero but small, but not wh en the
mutation rate is large enough.
2. In the regime where φ(/vector x,t→ ∞) has aδ-function contribution, this δ-function
is accompanied by a 1 /x2singularity at small /vector x.
3. Theδ-function peak emerges as the limit of a peak that continually become s
21
higher and narrower. Thus, in this regime the convergence to the t→ ∞limit
is power-law.
4. In the regime when φ(/vector x,t→ ∞) is smooth, the convergence to this distribution
is exponential in time.
5. The continuous- and discrete-time models exhibit qualitatively iden tical behav-
ior, but there are quantitative diﬀerences between them.
Our analysis of the discrete-time equations relies on the use of Gaus sian functions
for both the ﬁtness and mutation terms. However, our analysis of the continuous-
time model assumes only that the potential in the quantum mechanic s problem is
attractive and short-ranged. Therefore, we expect our result s to apply qualitatively
for a large class of diﬀerent mutation terms.
Other mechanisms giving rise to genetic diversity such as antagonist ic pleiotropy,
genetic drift, and discreteness of alleles change qualitatively the na ture of the equa-
tions describing the system. It will be interesting to see whether th e “condensation”
phenomenon investigated here is robust when these eﬀects are ta ken into account.
In addition to our mathematical analysis, we also attempted to asse ss whether
the degree of pleiotropy of genes resulted in systematic trends in t he degree of varia-
tion they exhibited in the mutations documented in online genetic data bases. These
attempts to correlate the degree of pleiotropy with the statistics of the sequence
variations were inconclusive.
Available database resources do not allow unbiased sampling of the se quence vari-
ation present in a natural population. Such a database is likely to eme rge as the
Human Genome Project’s present initiative to sample the extent of s equence varia-
tion in a wide array of genes in the American population progresses.

Appendix: The relation between eigenstates of the
Schr¨ odinger equation and the long-time behavior of
the continuous-time population genetics model
In section 4 above we use the result that the long-time behavior of E q. (54) is given
by the lowest energy eigenstate of the associated Schr¨ odinger E q. (58). This result
has been shown by B¨ urger and collaborators(B¨ urger & Bomze, 1 996, and references
therein); for completeness we derive it here and emphasize the implic ations for the
approach to the long-time behavior in the population biology model.
We assume that we know the solution of the time-independent proble m, which is
a set of eigenstates un(/vector x) which satisfy:
−1
2∇z2un(/vector z)+V(/vector z)un(/vector z) =Enun(/vector z). (62)
The eigenstates un(/vector z) are complete (any function can be written as a linear combi-
nation of them) and can be chosen to be orthonormal:
/integraldisplay
dNz u∗
n1(/vector z)un2(/vector z) =δn1,n2, (63)
where the star denotes complex conjugate. This normalization is us ual in quantum
mechanics(Schiﬀ, 1968).
We need to examine the time-dependent Eq. (54); using scaled varia bles, it is
written as:
−∂ψ(/vector z,t)
∂t=−/bracketleftbigg
a(t)+1
2∇2
z/bracketrightbigg
ψ(/vector z,t)+V(/vector z)ψ(/vector z,t), (64)
where
a(t) =/bracketleftbigg
−1
2∇2
z+V(z)/bracketrightbigg
ψ(/vector z,t)|/vector z=0. (65)
We write the wave function at time t0,ψ(/vector z,t0), as a linear combination of eigenstates:
ψ(/vector z,t0) =/summationdisplay
ibi(t0)ui(z). (66)
The condition ψ(/vector z= 0,t0) = 1 is enforced by requiring/summationtext
ibi(t0)ui(/vector z= 0) = 1. By
substituting the form (66) for ψand using the orthonormality of the eigenstates, one
ﬁnds equations for the time-evolution of the coeﬃcients bi:
−dbi(t)
dt=bi(t)[Ei−a(t)]. (67)
Integrating this equation yields:
bi(t) =bi(t0)A(t)e−Eit, (68)
23
whereA(t) = exp/bracketleftBig/integraltextt
t0ds a(s)/bracketrightBig
. Thus the ratio of the weights of any two eigenstates
i1andi2is given by:
bi1(t)
bi2(t)=bi1(t0)
bi2(t0)exp[−(Ei1−Ei2)t]. (69)
At long times the exponential factor ensures that the state with t he largest weight is
the one with the lowest energy.
If there is a nonzero energy gap between the lowest and second-lo west energy
eigenstates (no δ-function in φ(/vector x)), then Eq. (69) implies that the approach to the
long-time limit is exponential in time. If there is no bound state, then a ll the states
are extended and the spectrum is continuous; the Eitake the form Ei=q2
i/2, where
qihas the dimension of a wavevector in /vector zspace,(Schiﬀ, 1968) and hence a distance
in the original /vector xspace. Therefore,
ψ(/vector z,t) =A(t)/summationdisplay
ibi(t0)e−q2
it/2. (70)
The relative weight of the eigenstate iremains large until qi∼/radicalBig
1/t. Thus, the
δ-function at inﬁnite times emerges from a peak that is narrowing, ha ving a width
proportional to/radicalBig
1/t.
