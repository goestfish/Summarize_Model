Dynamics of topological solitons describing open states in the DNA double helix are studied in the frame-
works of themodel which takes intoaccount asymmetry ofthe h elix. Itis shownthat threetypes oftopological
solitons can occur in the DNA double chain. Interaction betw een the solitons, their interactions with the chain
inhomogeneities and stabilityof the solitons withrespect tothermal oscillations are investigated.

I. INTRODUCTION
It is widely accepted now that the DNA molecule has a
rather moveable internal structure, and that the internal D NA
mobility plays an important role in functioningthe molecul e.
The thermal bath where the DNA molecule is usually im-
mersed, collisions with the molecules of the solution which
surrounds DNA, local interactions with proteins, drugs or
some other ligands lead to activation of different types of i n-
ternal motions. Small oscillations of individual atoms nea r
equilibrium positions, rotational, transverse and longit udinal
displacements of atomic groups (phosphate groups, sugars
andbases),motionsofthedoublechainfragmentshavingsev -
eral base pairs lengths, local unwinding of the double helix ,
transitions of DNA fragments from one conformationalform
to another, for example, from A-form to B-form and so on,
are only some of them. A more detailed list of internal mo-
tionsandoftheirdynamicalcharacteristicscanbefoundin the
works of Fritzsche [1], Keepers and co-authors[2], McClure
[3],McCommonandco-authors[4],Yakushevich[5,6]).
Different approaches to the modeling of the internal DNA
mobilityareknown. OneofthemhasbeendevelopedbyPro-
hofskyandco-authors[7,8,9,10],whoconsideredDNAasa
lattice and took into account the motionsof all atoms(excep t
ofhydrogenatoms)inthelatticecell. Theirapproachwasli m-
ited,however,byharmonicapproximation,andthislimitat ion
didnotpermitthemtomodellargeamplitudeinternalmotion s
suchas,forexample,localunwindingofthedoublehelix. An -
otherapproach,basedon the methodsof moleculardynamics
and proposed ﬁrstly by Levitt [11] and Tidor and co-authors
[12],isknownnowasoneofthemostpowerfultoolsofinves-
tigation of the internal DNA mobility [13]. This approach is

‡Electronic address: lmanev@center.chph.ras.rutudes. The approach has, however, one essential deﬁciency:
because of the limited possibilities of modern computers it
can not be used to study long DNA fragments, and therefore
itdoesnotsuitableforstudiesoftheprocessesofpropagat ion
oflocalstructuraldistortionsalongthemolecule.
In this paper, to investigate the internal DNA mobility, we
use the approach developed in a series of works [14, 15, 16,
17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25]. Peculiarityoftheapproac h
is that it uses rather simple models of the internal DNA dy-
namics, which take into account only one or a few types of
theDNAinternalmotions. Thissimpliﬁcationgivesanoppor -
tunitytoﬁndanalyticalsolutionsofcorrespondingdynami cal
equations imitating both small and large amplitude interna l
motions. Andonemoremeritoftheapproachisthatitgivesa
possibility to study the internal dynamics of long DNA frag-
ments. Threeworksintheseriesareofmostinterest.
The ﬁrst one has been done by Englander and co-authors
[14] who studied the dynamics of DNA open states. Their
model took into account only rotational motions of nitrous
bases, which as it was suggested, made the main contribu-
tion to formation of the open states. Another paper belonged
to Peyrard and Bishop [22], who studied the processof DNA
denaturation. Suggesting that the stretching of the hydrog en
bonds in pairs made the most contribution into the process,
they created a simpliﬁed model where only transverse mo-
tionsofbasesalongthedirectionofthehydrogenbondswher e
taken into account. The third important paper was published
by Muto and co-authors [21]. These authors suggested that
two types of internal motions were made the main contribu-
tion to DNA denaturation process: transverse motions along
the hydrogen bond direction and longitudinal motions along
thebackbonedirection. Theirmodelconsistedoftwopolynu -
cleotide strands linked together through the hydrogen bond s
described by a Lennard-Jones potential, and the phosphodi-
ester bridges in the backbone were described by an anhar-
monicTodapotential.
Further development of the approach was limited for sev-
eral years by small improvements of the models and their
combinations, and only involvingnumerical methodsof sim-

ofVanZandt[26],Techeraandco-authors[27],Salerno[25] ,
Barbi[28,29],andCampa[30]. Justthesemethodspermitted
not only to study a possibility of appearance of large ampli-
tude localized distortions in the DNA structure, but also to
investigate their stability, the inﬂuence of thermal noise , the
interactions between the distortions, the propagation of t hem
alongthehomogeneousandinhomogeneousDNA.
In all these works, however, the asymmetry of the base
pairs was neglected. That is both bases in a pair weremodeled as identical structural elements with the same
characteristics (masses, moments of inertia and so on).
But even in the case of homogeneous (synthetic) DNA the
asymmetryexists. Indeed,if, forexample,oneof the polynu -
cleotide chains consists of only adenines, the other chain
should consist of thymines, and this homogeneous model is
substantially asymmetrical. Just this type of asymmetrica l
model is studied in this work. To simplify calculations, we
consider only rotational motions of nitrous bases around
the sugar-phosphate chains in the plane perpendicular to
the main axis of the double chain. We ﬁnd solitary wave
solutions describing open states in the double helix. We
classify the solitons, investigate stability of the solito ns with
respect to thermal oscillations, interactions between the
solitons, interaction of the solitons with inhomogeneitie s of
the chain. To solve all these problems, we use numerical-
variation methods efﬁciency of which was proved in the
works [31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36], devoted to the analysis of
nonlineardynamicsofmolecularchainsandpolymercrystal s.

LetusconsiderB-formoftheDNAmolecule,thefragment
of which is presented in Fig. 1. The lines in the ﬁgure cor-
respond to the skeleton of the double helix, black and grey
rectangles correspond to bases in pairs (AT and GC). Let us
focus our attention on the rotational motions of bases aroun d
the sugar-phosphate chains in the plane perpendicular to th e
helix axis. Below we shall call the chain placed on the left
by the ﬁrst chain, and the right chain – by the second one.

Let us consider the plane DNA model where the chains of
the macromolecule form two parallel straight lines placed a t
a distance hfrom each other, and the bases can make only
rotation motions around their own chain, being all the time
perpendicular to it. Let us suggest that ϕn,1is the angular
displacement of the n-th base of the ﬁrst chain, and ϕn,2is
theangulardisplacementofthe n-thbaseofthesecondchain.

The ﬁrst two terms of Hamiltonian (1) correspond to the ki-

the moment of inertia of the n-th base of the second chain,

(αβ=AT, TA, CG, GC )the moment of inertia is equaltoIn,1=mαr2

The third and the fourth terms in Hamiltonian (1) describe
interactionof the neighboringbasesalongeachof the macro -

molecule chains. Parameter ǫn,icharacterizes the energy of
interactionofthe n-thbasewiththe (n+1)-thbaseofthe i-th
chain(i= 1,2). Thevalueof the parameterisunknown. But

The pair AT (TA) is stabilized by two hydrogen bonds (they

V. DYNAMICALPROPERTIESOFSOLITONS
Atthebeginningletusconsiderstationarysolitonsolutio ns
oftheproblem(13). Inthedimensionlessfunctional ¯L,coefﬁ-
cientscα=cβ= 0whenv= 0. So, only one dimensionless
parameter g(12) which characterizes cooperativity of rota-
tional motions remains in functional (11). The existence of
soliton solution and its form depend on the value of the pa-
rameter.
A. Stationarysolution
Theresultsof numericalinvestigationsofthe problem(13)
show that in the homogeneous chains stationary topological
soliton solutions exist when the parameter of cooperativit yg
is larger than the threshold value: g≥g0>0. The ab-
sence of the soliton topological stability when g < g 0can
be explained in the following way. Any topological defect
can be eliminated by turning the DNA bases. The turning of
one base about 360 degrees transfers the system to the initia l
state, that is φi,n≡φi,n±2π. And this is why the narrow
solitonswith thesize equaltoonelinkofthechainareequiv -
alenttothegroundstateandthisiswhytheyareunstable. So ,
onlyrelativelywide solitonswith the generalturningcons ist-

|φi,n+1−φi,n| ≪2π,arestable. Dependenceofthethreshold
valueg0onthesolitontopologicalcharge qforhomogeneous
ATandGCchainsaregivenintheTable III.
From Fig. 3 it becomes clear that the soliton energy ¯E
and its width Dmonotonously increase when the parameter
of cooperativity gincreases. For soliton stability it is neces-
sary that its width D >4.33. The view of stationary solitons
with the parameters of cooperativity g= 10andg= 150
is presented in Fig. 4. In the case of the soliton with topo-
logical charge q=(1,0), the ﬁrst component has the form of a
smooth step (when nmonotonously changes, the base of the

thesecondcomponenthasthe formofa step (Fig. 4b). In the
case of soliton with q=(1,1), each of the components has the
form of a step (Fig. 4c), steps being displaced relatively on e
another. Later on we shall show that this soliton is the bound
stateoftwotopologicalsolitonswiththecharges q1=(1,0)and
q2=(0,1). There exist two equivalentstates of the soliton: th e
left state q=(1,1)l, when the soliton with the charge q1is on
left of the soliton with the charge q2(Fig. 4c), and the right
stateq=(1,1)r, whenthesolitonwiththecharge q1isonright
ofthesolitonwiththecharge q2.
Whenǫ= 6000 kJ/mol and K= 0.234N/m the pa-
rameter of cooperativity g= 150.24≫g0, and when
K= 0.8714N/m the parameter g= 40.34> g0(see Ta-
ble III) for all typesof topologicalsolitons. So, forthese val-
ues of the rigidity parameter Kstable solitons with different
topological charges exist. For maximum value of the rigid-
ity parameter K= 4.744N/m the parameterof cooperativity
g= 7.41< g0,andthismeansthatstabletopologicalsolitons
are absent. Thus the problem of the existence of topological
solitons (open states) in the DNA reduces to the problem of
receivingexactestimationoftheparameters ǫ K. But thisis,
however, a rather difﬁcult problem. We think that the values
ǫ= 6000kJ/mol,K= 0.8714N/m, when all three types of
solitonsexist, are the most grounded. And we shall use these
valuesforfurthercalculations.
Dependence of the energy Eand the diameter Dof sta-
tionary topological soliton on its topological charge qin the
chain with ǫ= 6000kJ/mol and the transverse rigidity de-
termined by formulas (4) and (8), are given in the Table IV.
From the data of the table it follows that the energy of the
interaction of the solitons with the charges (1,0) and (0,1) is
equalto∆E=E(1,0)+E(0,1)−E(1,1) = 90.71kJ/mol

Numerical investigationshows that all topological solito ns
at all permitted velocities are stable. They move along the
chain with constant velocity, their form and energy being
conserved. Thus, the speciﬁcity of the chain of the DNA
molecule leads to a principal effect consisting in the possi -
bility of preferable localization of soliton excitations o n one
chain. Moreover, it appears that soliton excitation with th e
charge (1,1) is a bound state of two excitations localized in
separatechains.

VI. INTERACTIONOFTOPOLOGICALSOLITONS
DNA is aratherlongmolecule,andseveralopenstatescan
beactivatedin it simultaneously. Thereforeit isinterest ingto
consider the problem of interaction of solitons imitating t he
openstates.
Numericalapproach(13)permitsustoinvestigatetheprob-
lem and to obtain the dependence of the energy of a pair of
solitonswith thecharges q1,q2onthedistance betweentheir
centersn1,n2. For the purpose, it is necessary to take the
boundary conditions and the initial point, which correspon d
toapairoftopologicalsolitonswiththecentersmovingawa y
at a distance R. When minimizing the energy of the system
E=−L, it is necessary also to ﬁx the turns of the bases,
which correspondto the centers of solitons. Then the energy
of the obtained state E(R)corresponds to the energy of a
pair of topological solitons, the solitons being at a distan ce
R=n2−n1from each other. By changing positions of the
solitoncenters,we canobtainthe potentialofinteraction
Uq1,q2(R) =E(R)−E(q1)−E(q2),
whereE(q1)andE(q2)isthe energyofisolatedsolitons.
The potential of interaction of solitons of different types
and the potential of topological solitons with the charges o f
the same sign are presented in Fig. 6. The potential of two
solitons of different types with q1= (1,0)andq2= (0,1)
has the form of symmetrical double well potential (Fig. 6,
curve 1). Maximum of the potential is reached when R= 0,
thatiswhenthecentersofthesolitonsareplacedattheneig h-
boringchainsandwhenthesolitonsareoppositetoeachothe r.
Fromenergeticpointofviewthisconﬁgurationofthesolito ns
of differentchains is the most disadvantageous. Minimum of
the energyis reached when R=±20a. Thus two solitons of
thistypecanformtwoenergeticallyequivalentcoupledsta tes.
Oneofthestates(leftminimumofthepotentialofinteracti on)
corresponds to the left isomer of the topological soliton wi th
the charge q= (1,1)l, and the otherstate (the right minimum
ofthepotentialofinteraction)correspondstotherightis omer
ofthesoliton q= (1,1)r.
If solitons have different signs of charges q1= (1,0)andq2= (0,−1), the potential ofinteractionhas a bell-like form
with one maximum at R= 0(Fig. 6, curve 2). From the
potentialitfollowsthat,thesolitonswhichbelongtodiff erent
chains,shouldrepulsefromeachother. Solitonswiththesa me
sign of charge ( q1=q2= (1,0), (0,1)) also repulse from
eachother.
When distance between the solitons decreases, the energy
monotonically increases and goes to inﬁnity when R→0
(Fig. 6, curve3).
The potential of interaction Uq1,q2(R)permits to predict
the result of repulsion of solitons with the charges q1and
q2. Let us model the repulsion of the solitons. For the pur-
pose, let us consider a double chain consisting of N= 4000
base pairs. At the ends of each of the polynucleotide chains
let us introduce viscous friction which provides with absor p-
tion of phonons. The system of equations of motion (5),
n= 1,2,...,N, was integrated numerically with the initial
conditionwhich correspondsto two topologicalsolitons wi th
the centers placed in the points n1=N/4andn2= 3N/4
andwith thevelocities s1=−s2=s >0.
The results show that collision of solitons having equal
signsq1=q2= (±1,0),(0,±1)leads to their reﬂection
at one another. When the velocities sare small, the reﬂection
ispracticallyelastic,andwhenthevelocities sarelarge,colli-
sionisaccompaniedbyslightemissionofphonons. Collisio n
of solitons with q1= (±1,0),q2= (0,∓1)ands= 0.5
leads to their reﬂection, accompanied by slight emission of
phonons. Thisbehavioris in a goodagreementwith the form
ofcorrespondingpotentialof interaction(Fig. 6, curve2) . To
pass through one another, solitons need to overcome energy
barrierUq1,q2(0) = 2025 kJ/mol. Thus, their kinetic energy
should be equal to Ek(s) =Eq1(s) +Eq2(s)−Eq1(0)−
Eq2(0)> Uq1,q2(0). This condition is fulﬁlled only in the
vicinity of the most possible values of the velocity (see. Fi g.
5). So, when s= 0.5, the kinetic energy Ek= 1732kJ/mol
is lower than the heightof the energybarrier(reﬂectiontak es
place), and when s= 0.6, the energy Ek= 3000.9kJ/mol is
higherthanthe barrier(solitonspassthroughoneanother) .
Solitons with the charges q1= (±1,0),q2= (0,±1)at-
tract one another at a distance R >20a, and when the dis-
tance is shorter they repulse one another. Here the energy
barrierUq1,q2(0) = 4989 kJ/mol does not permit solitons to
pass throughone another. Solitons always reﬂect. Formatio n
of the bound state does not occur even when the value of the
velocity is small. It is explained by small value of the bond
energy∆E= 91kJ/mol.
Potential of interaction of different topological soliton s
with the charges of opposite signs (q1=−q2)is presented
in Fig. 7. Potential of interaction of one component soliton s
(q1= (1,0),(0,1))monotonically decreases with the de-
creasing of the distance between the solitons. When R→0,
thepotential Uq1,q2(R)→ −[E(q1)+E(q2)]. At adistance
R= 0solitonscompletelyrecombine.
Potentialof interactionof two componentsolitonswith the
charges of different signs has a similar form. If the soliton s
havedifferentpolarity,thatis,iftheﬁrstsolitonisalef tisomer
(q1= (1,1)l)and the second soliton is a right isomer (q2=
(−1,−1)r). Solitons of that type attract one another. Their

If solitons have the same polarity, they repulse when R >
20a, and attract when the distances are shorter. Recombi-
nation of the solitons requires overcoming the energy bar-
rier 1730 kJ/mol. Solitons overcome the barrier only when
s >0.38,andthevalueoftheirkineticenergyismorethanthe

Till now our investigation was limited by consideration of
homogeneous model of DNA. The real DNA is, however, a
substantiallyinhomogeneoussystem,thereforeit isofspe cial
interest to consider the effect of the chain inhomogeneity o n
the dynamics of topological solitons. In the inhomogeneous
chain, the energy of stationary soliton Ewill depend on the
position of the center of the soliton ¯n. To move, soliton re-

the condition Ek(s) =E(s)−E(0)> Ed. Soliton can to
overcome the barrier only when its velocity s > s d, where
the threshold value of the velocity sdis taken from equation
E(sd)−E(0) =Ed. From the data of Fig. 5 it is easy to
ﬁnd, that for soliton with q=(1,0) the velocity sd= 0.21, for
solitonwith q=(0,1)thevelocity sd= 0.28,andwhen q=(1,1)
thevelocity sd= 0.17.
Letusmodelnumericallytheinteractionofsolitonwithlo-

us consider homogeneousAT chain consisting of N= 4000

In the chain one part of which consists of only AT base
pairs, and the other – of only GC base pairs energetic bar-
rier takes the form of smooth step (Fig. 10c). The height of
the step is equal to the difference between the values of soli -
ton energy in homogeneous GC and AT chains. From data
of table IV it follows, that the height of the step is equal
to∆E= 1065kJ/mol for soliton with topological charge
q=(1,0) and ∆E= 844kJ/mol for soliton with q=(0,1), and
whenq=(1,1) the energy ∆E=1894 kJ/mol. Soliton moving
along homogeneous AT region of the chain, can enter into
GC region only if its kinetic energy Ek(s)>∆E. As seen
from Fig. 5, this condition is satisﬁed only if soliton veloc -
itys > sk, where the threshold value of the velocity is de-
termined by the equation Ek(sk) = ∆E. For soliton with
q=(1,0) the velocity sk= 0.48, forq=(0,1)sk= 0.59, and
forq=(1,1)thevelocity sk= 0.52.
Let us model numerically the soliton moving from homo-
geneous AT region of the chain to homogeneous GC region.
The results of the modelingshow that the soliton with veloc-

elastically from the boundary between the regions. At given
velocitythesolitonkineticenergyisnotlargeenoughtoov er-
come energeticbarrier( Ek(s)≪∆E). Soliton with s= 0.5
q= (1,0)moves through the boundary between homoge-
neous regions and its motion is accompanied by emission of
phonons. Inside the region consisting of GC base pairs, soli -
ton continues to move, but with a smaller magnitude of the
velocity(Fig. 11). Forgivenvalueof qthe thresholdvalueof
the velocity sk= 0.48<0.5. So, the kinetic energy of soli-
ton is large enough to overcome energetic barrier. Because
the main part of the kinetic energy is spent to overcome the
barrier,thevelocityofthesolitonsubstantiallydecreas esafter
overcomingthe barrier. When q=(0,1) the threshold value of
thevelocity sk= 0.59andsolitonreﬂectsat s= 0.5fromthe
boundary of the homogeneous regions. The reﬂection is ac-
companied by phonon emission. For soliton with the charge
q=(1,1) the velocity s= 0.5< sk= 0.52is not enough to
overcome energetic barrier. Collision of soliton having to po-
logical charge (q= (1,1)l)with the boundary between the
homogeneous regions leads to the disintegration of the soli -
ton. It disintegratesintotwo onecomponentsolitonswith t he
chargesq1= (1,0)andq2= (0,1). Soliton with the charge

Let us consider the propagation of soliton in the inhomo-
geneous chain with random sequence of bases. In this case
randomenergeticrelief E(n)isformed. Theamplitudeofthe
relief for soliton with q=(1,0) reaches 1000 kJ/mol, and for
soliton with q=(1,1) – 1500 kJ/mol (Fig. 10d). It is obvious
that uniform propagation of soliton in the chain of that type

Let us consider the movement of soliton through inhomo-

ofnumericalmodelingofthesolitondynamicsshowthatsoli -
ton with small value of the velocity s= 0.05and with any
topologicalchargereﬂects from the boundaryof the inhomo-
geneous region. This points out, that penetration of the sol i-
ton into the inhomogeneous region requires the overcoming
of some energy barrier. Soliton with larger velocity s= 0.5
andcharge q= (1,0)overcomesthis barrier,entersthe disor-
dered region of the chain and stops there. The movement in
thedisorderedregionisaccompaniedbyintensiveemission of
phonons, which leads to the stop of the soliton. Soliton with

enters inhomogeneous region, and at the same time it dis-

Let us check stability of topological soliton with respect
to thermal oscillations of the chain. For the purpose, let
us consider homogeneous periodical AT chain consisting of
N= 4000base pairs at the temperature T= 300K. Let us

rigidityK= 0.234N/m and K= 0.8714N/m. The viscos-
ity of the environment leads to quick stop of the soliton, and

Let us note that topological soliton can move along the
DNA chain in the presence of viscosity too. To organize the
propagation it is necessary to select in a special way the se-

Thermal phononssubstantially inﬂuence the interaction of
solitons. In the work [42], it was shown that topologicalsol i-
tons of the model φ–4, can interact with one another through
thermal phonons. This interaction comes to repulsion of the
solitons. As a result, in the thermalized chain the interact ion
of the solitons of different charges substantially changes . At

let usconsidercollisionofsolitonswith differentcharge sand
polarities in the thermalized cyclic AT chain (q1= (1,1)l,
q2= (−1,−1)r,s1=−s2= 0.5). In the nonthermalized
chain (T= 0K), the solitons attract one another, and the col-
lision leads to their recombination. In the thermalized cyc lic
chain (T= 300K), their collision always leads to reﬂection

(Fig. 16). This behavior can be explained by compression ofphononsgasbetweensolitonswhentheyaredrawingtogether .
The compressionleads to the repulsionof solitons, which in -
creases as far as they are drawing together. In the chain with
free ends, the compression of the phonon gas leads to long
rangerepulsionofthesolitonsfromtheendsofthechain.
Thus, topological solitons of the DNA chains are stable
with respect to thermal oscillations. Interaction with the rmal
phonons does not lead to destruction or to the braking of the
soliton, it leads only to changing the interaction between t he
solitons. In the thermalized chain, long range repulsion be -

IX. CONCLUSION
Investigationcarriedoutinthispapershowsthatthreetyp es
of topological solitons which imitate localized states wit h
open base pairs, can exist in the considered asymmetrical
model of the DNA double chain. It was shown that the soli-
tonscan movealong the macromoleculewith constant veloc-
ity which is smaller than the sound velocity. In the inhomo-
geneouschain,thecharacterofthesolitonmovementdepend s
on the sequence of base pairs in the molecule. In the chain
with random inhomogeneoussequence, solitons can move at
a distance no more than several hundreds of base pairs. The
results of numerical investigations show that the solitons are
stable with respect to thermal oscillations. Interaction o f the
solitonswiththermalphononsofthemacromoleculedoesnot
leadto destructionorto the brakingof thesolitons. And onl y
thecharacteroftheirinteractionschanges. Thedrawingof the
solitons together leads to their repulsion, which is explai ned
bycompressionofphonongasbetweenthem.
All these results point out that topological solitons of thi s
