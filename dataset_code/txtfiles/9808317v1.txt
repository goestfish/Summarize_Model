Abstract
Wepresentastatistical modelofbacterial evolution based onthecouplingbe-
tween codon usage and tRNA abundance. Such a model interpret s this aspect
of the evolutionary process as a balance between the codon ho mogenization
eﬀect due to mutation process and the improvement of the trans lation phase
due to natural selection. We develop a thermodynamical desc ription of the
asymptotic state of the model. The analysis of naturally occ urring sequences
shows that the eﬀect of natural selection on codon bias not onl y aﬀects genes
whose products are largely required at maximal growth rate c onditions but

I. INTRODUCTION
The evolution of the genetic material is determined by theinteractio ns among mutations,
random drift and natural selection.
The mutation rate seems to vary both among and within genomes, be ing aﬀected by
many factors, such as the chromosomal position (Sharp et al., 1989), the G+C content
(Wolfe, 1991), the nearest neighbor bases (Blake et al., 1992), the diﬀerent eﬃciency of the
repair systems between the lagging and the leading DNA strands dur ing replication and

transcription (Veaute & Fuchs, 1993). Thus the molecular clock se ems to tick at diﬀerent
rate for diﬀerent DNA positions.
The natural selection acts as a driving force at virtually all levels of t he genetic in-
formation processing and biological organization: from the DNA sta bility, replication and
transcription to messenger RNA life span and translation eﬃciency, to the correct function-
ing of the gene products in the building up and propagation of a living or ganism. Although
in principle all these constraints could interact in a very complex way, it is indeed fruitful
to try to untangle the role of each element.
We have focused on the translation process as a major source of ﬁ tness for the bacterial
cell.
Because of the degeneracy of the genetic code and the historical process of codon capture
(Osawa & Jukes, 1989), diﬀerent codons (synonymous codons) s pecify for the same amino
acid. The bias in the codon usage is generally not random and it is very m arked in some
procaryotic and eucaryotic genes. The codon choice is specie-spe ciﬁc (Grantham et al.,
1980), being roughly the same, although with diﬀerent intensities, in all the genes within a
genome. The codon bias is thought to be an eﬀect of the improvemen t of the eﬃciency of
the translation process under natural selection.
Several authors have stressed that synonymous codons in E. coli, preferentially used in
highly expressed genes, are translated by the most abundant iso- acceptors tRNA species
and that the levels of tRNAs in bacterial cells depend on the amino acid usage in proteins
(Ikemura, 1981a).
A good correlation between codon usage and tRNAs population has a lso been found in
Mycoplasma capricolum (Yamaoet al., 1991), in yeast (Ikemura, 1981b) (Ikemura, 1985)
and in chloroplast genomes (Morton, 1993).
The importance of codon usage as a substrate for natural select ion is well proved by the
coding strategy of the coli phage T4: the early expressed genes of T4have a codon pattern
close to that of E. coliwhile the late expressed genes show a preference towards the cod ons
read by the tRNAs expressed by the genome of the phage itself (Co we & Sharp, 1991).
The codon usage inﬂuences the elongation rate in the translation pr ocess, being the
pairing between codon and anticodon of the diﬀusing tRNA the rate- limiting step compared
with the peptide bond formation and translocation steps (Gouy & Gr antham, 1980), but
it cannot be directly related to the protein expression rate. In fac t many experiments have
demonstrated that other crucial steps aﬀecting the protein pro duction rate are the selection
of mRNA by a ribosome, the initiation phase and the phenomenon of po lypeptidyl-tRNA
drop oﬀ (Menninger, 1978).
Moreover the dynamic of elongation phase seems to be more complex , depending also by
the diﬀerences in the energy of codon anticodon pairing (Grosjean & Fiers, 1982) (Thomas
et al., 1988); thus diﬀerences in elongation rates have been found for c odons read by the
same tRNA species (Sorensen & Pedersen, 1991).
Diﬀerent considerations should be drawn on the evolutionary role of either the minor or
the major codons. Some authors have suggested that selection o f some of the rarer tRNA
species may be the rate-limiting step in protein synthesis (Varenne et al., 1984): they hy-
pothesize that the rate of polypeptide elongation could act as a reg ulatory mechanism in
gene expression when clusters of rare codons undergo translatio n, i.e. when the required
tRNA concentration is low and rate-limiting. This hypothesis has been conﬁrmed exper-
2
imentally by manipulating the concentrations of some tRNAs and crea ting rate-limiting
conditions. Varenne (Goldman, 1982) (Varenne et al., 1984) demonstrated experimentally
that the presence of rare codons in highly expressed coding region s is associated with pauses
in the synthesis of proteins. Many diﬀerent contexts have been te sted with similar results:
Hoekema (Hoekema et al., 1987) replaced some major codons present in the ﬁrst region of
thePGK1gene ofSaccharomices cerevisiae with synonymous minor codons; Kinnaird (Kin-
nairdet al., 1991) generated a cluster of three rare codons in the GDHgene inNeurospora
crassa. Chen and Inouye (Chen & Inouye, 1990) have demonstrated tha t the introduction
of a cluster of a rare codon, AGG, in lacZsequence of E. coli, lowers the expression of the
gene; moreover this eﬀect is inversely correlated with the distance between the initiation site
and the position of rare codons.
Models that takes into account the inﬂuence of minor codons in the in itiation region of
mRNA for protein production rate have been presented (Liljenstr om & von Heijne, 1987)
(Liljenstrom & Bomberg, 1987).
On the contrary Sharp and Li (Sharp & Li, 1986) have hypothesize d that the pattern
of synonymous codon usage in regulatory genes reﬂects primarily t he relaxation of natural
selection. In fact, the absence of rare codons from highly expres sed genes may well result
from negative selection, while in low expressed genes, selection again st rare codons is very
weak and so they can accumulate under the pressure of mutation.
Remarkably diﬀerent considerations should be drawn for the major codons, i.e. codons
read by the most abundant tRNAs. There is evidence that the majo r proteins are translated
faster than other proteins and that the elongation rate at major codons is faster than that
at other codons (Emilsson & Kurland, 1990a).
Some authors (Emilsson & Kurland, 1990a) (Emilsson & Kurland, 1990 b) have hypoth-
esized that growth rate, in bacteria, depends on tRNA abundance . Such relation results in
the so called growth maximization strategy and it is consistent with a m ajor codon prefer-
ence strategy, in which an optimal subset of codons is thought to b e used very frequently in
highly expressed genes, and their cognate tRNA species are suppo sed to increase consider-
ably at high growth rates conditions. This is in agreement with the fac t that the genes for
the major tRNA species are located inside rRNA operons for a coord inate expression.
The growth rate dependence on tRNA abundances and other aspe cts of the evolution
of genes and genomes in bacteria can be faced with statistical mech anics tools. Let us
consider an homogeneous population of bacterial genomes, subje cted only to synonymous
mutations and natural selection. If we study its evolution in the pro ximity of a steady
dynamical state, as for instance a balanced growth state, we can interpret the interaction
between mutations and natural selection as a competition between randomness and order.
In this spirit we develop a statistical model from which bacterial evo lution emerges as an
optimization process under environmental constraints.
II. THE MODEL
In order to study quantitatively the competition between mutation and natural selection
in naturally occurring sequences, we concentrate on the process of the elongation phase.
We suppose that the rate limiting step in this phase is the relative abun dance of charged
3
tRNAs. Thus we assume that thetime required by a ribosome to proc ess a codonisinversely
proportional to the abundance of the charged cognate tRNAs in it s vicinity. Taking into
account the data from Gouy and Grantham (Gouy & Grantham, 198 0), the process of
tRNA diﬀusion in cell extract results much faster than all others pr ocesses involved in our
schematization, and thus we do not consider the eﬀects of spatial gradients.
Furthermore, we assume that the eﬃciency of aminoacyl-tRNA syn thetases is not rate
limiting, i.e. that the concentration of the charged tRNAs does not v ary with the trans-
lation process regardless of the codon composition of mRNAs. This a pproximation is not
completely fulﬁlled in real bacteria. From the same source above (Go uy & Grantham, 1980)
weobtainthatinaverageonly85%ofthetRNApoolisacylated, indica ting thatthereaction
rate of synthetase is not substrate limited.
In this approximation we do not take into account the ﬁnite size of a r ibosome, nor the
queuing of ribosomes, thus disregarding the positional eﬀects of c odon usage, as considered
elsewhere (Liljenstrom & Bomberg, 1987).
With this assumption, the translation time does not depend on the or der of codons in
mRNA and can be calculated as the sum of the time required for each c odon. Finally, we
do not consider the inﬂuence of ﬂuctuations, i.e. we develop a sort o f “mean ﬁeld” model
for the translation.
We indicate the portion of mRNA that code for a protein (or, alterna tively, the whole
mRNA) with a vector c;ci(i= 1,... ,61) being the number of codons of type iand
L=/summationtext
icithe length of the coding region. We denote with akthe relative abundance of
acylated tRNA of type k(k= 1,... ,n tRNA;/summationtextntRNA
k=1ak= 1). For E. colintRNA= 45, see
also the following section. The “translational eﬃciency” of codons b y tRNAs is represented
by means of a matrix Rikof size 61 ×ntRNA. Again from (Gouy & Grantham, 1980), the
transpeptidation and translocation phases do not weight heavily on the tRNA cycle, and
disregarding them, the mean time required to translate the codon iis inversely proportional
toρi=/summationtextntRNA
k=1Rikak. The mean translation time per codon τ(in arbitrary time units) is
thus given by
τ(c) =1
L61/summationdisplay
i=1ci
ρi. (1)
For simplicity, the elements Rikcan be taken to be either 0, for a tRNA kthat does not
pair with a codon i, or 1, disregarding the diﬀerences in energies in the codon-anticod on
pairing discussed in the previous section.
In bacteria, cell division and DNA replication are coupled with cell grow th (Zyskind &
Smith, 1992) (Ageno, 1992). In balanced growth conditions the av erage number of genomes,
the average number of cells and the cell mass increase exponentially with the same rate.
The cell growth largely depends on the production rate of the most abundant biopoly-
mers, among which ribosomal proteins constitute the larger fract ion. The time τin formula
(1), calculated for an “average” ribosomal protein, can be consid ered proportional to the
mean duplication time. We assume that the natural selection tends t o lower this time. A
somewhat opposite eﬀect is due to the mutation process, that ten ds to randomize the codon
sequence. Since silent mutations do not change the coded aminoacid and thus they do not
4
aﬀect the composition of proteins, they are neutral for the selec tion over the protein func-
tionality. However, silent mutation are not neutral for the calculat ion of the duplication
timeτ, because of the presence of the abundance of cognate tRNAs in f ormula (1).
Let us start from a simpliﬁed situation, in which two synonymous codo ns (say codon
0 and 1) are only read by two tRNAs (with respectively abundances a0anda1), while all
other codons are grouped together (say codon 2) and in average are read by tRNAs with
abundance a2(a0+a1+a2= 1). The number of synonymous codons is c0+c1=l. We
consider only mutations between 0 and 1 and vice versa. Since τdoes not depend on the
order of the codons in the string, the various strains can be group ed together according with
the number jof one’s in the mRNA ( j=c1). For each group jthere are gj=/parenleftbiggl
j/parenrightbigg
strains.
We rewrite the formula (1) for the time τjrequired to duplicate a bacterium belonging
to group jas

The quantity K−1is the relative abundance of the synonymous codons 0 and 1 in the
coding region. For l≪L,K→ ∞; forl≃L,K≃0. Since selection only acts on 0 and 1
codons,K−1give an indication of the inﬂuence of selection on the gene.

dt=νjMj; (3)
where for simplicity we set all constants to 1 and we neglect the time d ependence of Mj.
In the limit of very low mutation rate, we can assume that for each ge neration there is
at most only one synonymous mutation, that changes codon 1 to 0 o r vice versa. Let us
indicate with µ/lthe rate of mutation per codon ( µ≤1). The average fraction of bacteria
in group jthat undergo a mutation per unit of time is µνj. For bacteria in group j, a
synonymous mutation changes jof one unit. Including mutations, and working with the
massmj=Mj/gjof a single strain in group j, formula (3) becomes

The total mass of the bacterial population is M=/summationtextl
k=0gkmk. We can derive from
eq. (4) the evolution equation for the distribution probability pj=mj/Mof diﬀerent
strains in the total population. In a natural environment the expo nential growth periods
are sporadic, generally followed by starvation phases. We mimic this a lternation by means
of the normalization of distribution, assuming that the strains corr esponding to a very low
probability are those eliminated by natural selection.

Before dealing with these equations from a mathematical point of vie w, let us put some
thermodynamical considerations. The scenario is reminiscent of st atistical mechanics sys-
tems, in which there is competition between order (the energy func tion to be minimized,
related to the average duplication time) and the entropy, mutuate d by the temperature.
Each strain in group jcontributes with τjto the mean duplication time. Taking
into account the analogy between the duplication time of strains and the energy lev-
els of a statistical system, in the equilibrium (stationary) state we c an tentatively apply
the methods from equilibrium statistical mechanics. The maximization of the “entropy”

distribution within those with the same ﬁtness), gives the Boltzmann distribution (Landau
& Lifshitz, 1958)
pj=Cexp(−βτj).
The Lagrange multiplier βcan be considered as the inverse of an eﬀective “temperature”
T, that, intuitively, should be related to the mutation rate µ. In the stationary state, ¯ νis
constant in time, and from eq. (5), M(and thus mj) grows exponentially.
Inserting the Ansatz
mj=M0exp(αt−βτj)
(M0is the total mass at time t= 0) in the equation (4), and using the relations (2), we get
for the asymptotic state
(1−µ)νj−α+l−j

lµνj−11
x= 0, (7)
wherex= exp(−βr). Approximating νj+1≃νj−1≃νj, with an error of order r/τ2
j, which is
small for lorLlarge ora1−a0small, eq. (7) becomes a linear equation in j. This equation
holds independently of jif

where ˜ai=ai/a2,i= 0,1.
Note that α= ¯ν. Numerical simulations of eq.(6) agree very well with this solution, an d
show that it is the only stable solution for almost all initial distributions .

It is remarkable that although the distribution of pjis always a growing function of j(for

ForL≫l(K→ ∞),x= 1,T→ ∞,α= 0 and jmax=l/2. The distribution pjis
ﬂat because in this case the selection has no eﬀect. This is due to the eﬀective neutrality of
mutations inside a group j.
Let us consider in the following the opposite case L=l(K= 0), that represents a
bacterium in which an essential protein is totally composed by the sing le aminoacid coded
by 0 and 1 codons. This rather unrealistic case makes our model equ ivalent to a 1D kinetic
Ising model (Kawasaki, 1972) in an external ﬁeld without interactio ns among spins. In this
case we can analize in more details the inﬂuence of selection.
We can express αandβin term of ε=a1−a0:

with 0≤ε≤1.
Forε→0 (a1≃a0,r→0) we have T=β−1= 4µ+O(ε2) andα= 1/2l. This
relationship conﬁrms the intuitive corrispondence between temper ature and mutation rate,
at least for moderate diﬀerences in the tRNA abundances. For µ→0, we get jmax=l,
corresponding to a distribution dominated by the ﬁtter strains. In creasing the mutation rate
µ,jmaxdecreases; extrapolating to inﬁnite value of µ(beyond the validity of our model), we
getjmax=l/2, and the inﬂuence of selection is vanished by mutations.
7
Forε→1 (a1≫a00,r→ −∞),T→ ∞andα= (1−µ)/l. In this limit only the ﬁttest
groupj=jmax=lsurvives. In this case all mutations are deleterious, and their eﬀec t is to
lower the growth rate αof the total mass of bacterial population.
At this stage of development, our model is too simpliﬁed to allow quant itative com-
parison with experimental data. However, it can be used as an inter pretative tool for the
understanding of the mutation/selection dynamics.
III. PERTINENT DNA SEQUENCES ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION
In order to estimate the degree of optimization between codons an d tRNA species we
have analyzed 1530 Escherichia coli coding regions.
The choice of analyzing mainly the E. colicoding sequences depends not only on the
large amount of data in literature and the large number of genes tha t have been sequenced
(about 35% of the genome, at this date) but on the fact that in E. coligenome the eﬀect of
a directional mutational pressure towards an increase in G+C or A+ T content is very little
(about 51% G+C content), as compared with other organisms like Micrococcus luteus (74%
G+C content) or Mycoplasma capricolum (25 % G+C content) (Sueoka, 1993) (Osawa &
Jukes, 1988b). This pressure, probably due to mutations in the DN A polymerase system,
acts particularly in shrinking the codon and anticodon sets: in E. colithere are 75 tRNA
genes, and 45 types of anticodons, while in Micrococcus luteus orMycoplasma capricolum
these numbers are much lower (29 and 33 tRNA genes, resp.). Besid es, the large eﬀects of
the directional mutational pressure on genomes composition prob ably results in weakening
other existing functional constraints.
For each gene we have considered the simple relationship (1) betwee n codons at position
i, (ci)andtRNAmoleculeabundances( ρi). Wehaveconsideredequaltranslationaleﬃciency
for all codons.
The eﬀective tRNA species abundances at diﬀerent duplication rate s are not exactly
known; little diﬀerences in the total tRNA abundances have been pr oved experimentally
among diﬀerent strains of E. coli(Jakubowski, 1984), but the relative abundances do not
seem to vary largely even among diﬀerent species of enterobacter ia: the data by Ikemura
show that there is a good correspondence between the relative ab undances of the tRNA
species between E. coliandSalmonella typhimurium . Thus we have approached the problem
performing the calculations in two ways:
a) considering the data on the relative abundances of the tRNA spe cies published
by Ikemura ( τI) (Ikemura, 1981a) (Ikemura, 1981b) (Ikemura, 1985) and Jak ubowski
(Jakubowski,1984).
b) using the data on tRNA gene dosage published by Komine ( τK) (Komine et al., 1990).
Both these two implementations are aﬀected by diﬀerent approxima tions.
In case (a) the data determined by Ikemura are not exhaustive. W e have approximated
the abundances of the minor tRNAs at the value 0.1 with respect to t he abundance of Leu-
tRNA normalized at 1. In case (b) we have considered the abundanc e of tRNA species to
be just proportional to the number of tRNA genes; this assumptio n could be not completely
true because diﬀerent tRNA gene clusters are regulated by diﬀere nt promoters and because
of diﬀerences in aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases abundances and cat alytic activities.
8
In Fig. 1 we report the average time spent per codon τIfor 1530 coding sequences, both
for the correct reading frame and for the +1 and +2 reading frame s. The sequences are
ordered according with the value of τIof the correct reading frame.
In Fig. 2 we report τKfor the same sequences of Fig. 1.
The comparison of the two ﬁgures shows that there is a good agree ment between the
values of τIandτK, although the data obtained using the distribution of tRNA abundan ces
from Ikemura show a more marked separation between the correc t reading frame and the
+1 and +2 frames. This indicates that there is a good corresponden ce between tRNA
abundances and number of copy of the related tRNA gene, i.e. the m ost abundant tRNAs
are expressed by triplicated or quadruplicated genes while the less a bundant tRNA species
are expressed by genes present in a single copy.
In all the analyzed coding regions, the correct reading frame alway s presents the lower
crossing times, although the diﬀerences are more marked for the h ighly expressed sets: the
mean translation time of the correct reading frame for highly expre ssed coding regions (as
ribosomal genes, see Fig. 1) is lower than those calculated for non h ighly expressed coding
regions, while the value for the +1 and +2 frames are equal or somet imes greater.
We have also compared our results with the Sharp and Li’s Codon Adap tation Index
(CAI) of each sequence. This index does not depend directly on the abun dances of tRNA
but it is a measure of the bias in codon usage (Sharp & Li, 1987) deﬁne d as follows
CAI=/parenleftBiggl/productdisplay
k=1wk/parenrightBigg1
l
;CAI∈(0,1) (9)
where the product of wk=w(ik) is taken over the code under examination. The quantities
w(ik) for a codon iat position kis given by the relative frequency of the codon iwith
respect to the most used codon for the same aminoacyd in a set of h ighly expressed genes.
Note that in principle is possible to sinthetize artiﬁcial sequences mad e only of major codons
with aCAIvalue greater than that of the most abundant proteins. This occo urs because
this index neglect the inﬂuence of mutations. The same misundersta nding occours with our
quantity τ.
In Fig. 3 we report the CAIvalues for the same sequences of Fig. 1. The agreement
with both the τIandτKis rather good.
Thegenesthatshowahighlybiasedcodonusagehavehighvaluesof CAI(andlowvalues
ofτI) and belong to the translationand transcription machinery, asfor instance genes coding
for ribosomal proteins, initiation and elongation factors, heat sho ck or stringent response
proteins, genes involved in the core of intermediate metabolism and g enes coding for the
most abundant membrane proteins.
Generally the genes whose products are proved to be required for maximal growth rate
show high value of CAI. We can consider for instance the118IF2αand71IF2β(Sacerdot
et al., 1992) that operate in the initiation of the translation process and probably aﬀect
the production of ribosomal RNA, and the product of the nusAgene that is involved in
the transcriptional process. These three genes are clustered in the same operon, probably
for a co-regulation of translation and transcription. The apices ind icate the position of the
sequences in the ﬁgures.
9
The DNA polymerases I and II are present in diﬀerent concentratio ns; about 400
molecules of polymerase I per cell with respect to 17-100 molecules p er cell of polymerase
II (Adams et al., 1992). The CAIvalues of the two genes (334polAand760polB) reﬂect the
diﬀerence: 0.403 ( τI= 2.29) versus 0.352 ( τI= 2.89).
Since biosynthetic operons are quite constitutively expressed, ex cept during starvation
conditions, the genes coding for the repressor proteins show CAIvalues lower than repressor
genes in catabolic operons.
In some cases genes coding for functional aggregates constitut ed by structural proteins
interacting in a precise stoichiometry ratio show values of CAIorτIclose to this ratio. This
relation is true only for highly expressed genes; for example some rib osomal proteins, as1L7
and11L20, arepresent asa tetramer ineach ribosome(Adams et al., 1992): the CAIvalueof
the correspondent genes are higher than those of other ribosom al genes; the same correlation
hasbeenfoundforATP synthetases genes that codeforalargec omplex constituted bymany
copies of diﬀerent subunits: there is a good agreement between th eCAIvalues of the genes
and the stoichiometry of the subunits in the complex. This correspo ndence almost vanishes
for structural proteins coded by low expressed genes as those c oding for ﬁmbriae, pili and
ﬂagella.
Generally, the enzymes that channel a metabolic pathway do not pr esent the same bias
in codon usage, probably because natural selection acts primary o n the homogenization of
the catalytic activity of the metabolon, however there are also few interesting clues of the
contrary.
The membrane lipids biosynthesis in E. coliinvolves the action of at least 25 genes;
many of these are clustered in the faboperon. Although the regulation of this pathway is
very complex and not yet completely elucidated, with regard to both the total fatty acid
content and the phospholipids composition, there are some observ ations that indicate that
the activities of few enzymes (acetyl-CoA:ACP transacetylase, ac etyl CoA carboxylase) are
rate limiting in vivo (Magnuson et al., 1993). We have found that the bias in codon usage
of these genes is higher than that of the genes coding for the othe r enzymes of the pathway.
Since growth rate depends also by membrane lipids production, the b ias in the bottleneck
of the pathway probably increases the rate of production, while its eﬀect on the other genes
is vanishingly small.
Other interesting examples regard the relatively high bias in codon us age in genes like
24spoT,180htpr,280uspA,295ﬁs,130cspAand175ackA.
SincespoTencodes for a ppGpp pyrophosphohydrolase, it takes into accoun t for the
degradationofppGpp, themajorinductorofthestringent respo nse, thataccumulatesduring
starvation periods.
Nutritionalshift-upexperiments, inwhichlargeamountofnutrient sareaddedtobacteria
growing in a minimal medium, have revealed that there are immediate ch anges in the rate
of increase of cell mass while the cell division rate continues for some time at pre-shift rate
(Cooper, 1991).
Thus the competition among bacteria requires to exit quickly fromth e starvation periods
and to restart growing when conditions have changed; in this sight t hespoTgene (CAI=
0.59,τI=1.4 ) could be a very important target for natural selection. Prob ably for the same
reason the htprgene (CAI= 0.553, τI= 1.95) has a relatively highly biased codon usage:
the encoded protein coordinates the global response of the cell t o heat shock events. In fact
10
this gene codes for a sigma-32 subunit that substitutes the sigma- 70 in the core of RNA
polymerase making the new holoenzyme capable of activating the hea t shock promoters.
Henceforth other heat shock genes show a biased codon usage as for instance485dnaJand
462groEL. The intracellular amount of the universal stress protein, coded b y the gene uspA
(CAI= 0.52,τI= 2.19), greatly increases in the cases of exhaustion of nutrients lik e carbon,
nitrogen, phosphate, sulfate or aminoacid (Nystrom & Neidhardt, 1992).
We hypothesize that codon usage reﬂects not only the eﬀects of s election for high growth
rate conditions but also selection for very fast, and perhaps shor t time lasting, response to
equally rapid environment changes. A clue that agrees well with this h ypothesis concerns
theﬁsgene (CAI= 0.53,τI= 2.21) whose product functions as a DNA binding protein,
involved in recombination reactions and in rRNA transcription. It has been reported that
when the availability of a rich medium allows the bacterial cells to exit fro m the stationary
phase, the amount of the ﬁsgene product increases from less than 100 copies to over 50000
copiesbeforetheﬁrst cell division. Astheexponential growthgoe son, theFislevels decrease
considerably (Ball et al., 1992). The gene cspA(CAI= 0.808, τI= 1.81) codes for the major
cold shock gene (CS7.4) (Tanabe et al., 1992); when the temperature shifts from 37◦Cto
10◦Cthe level of the protein largely increases and becomes about 13% of the total proteins
in the bacterial cell.
It is noteworthy that since acetyl phosphate seems to be a global regulator of signal
transduction in E. coli, also the gene ackA(CAI= 0.66,τI= 1.9) that codes for a protein
that synthesizes acetyl phosphate from ATP and acetate prese nts a high value of CAI.
There are genes with little if any diﬀerences in values of τIbetween the correct reading
frame and the others. This is mostly true for genes in plasmids (see F ig. 1). Since plasmids
and conjugative transposons play a key role in the interchange of d rug resistance and viru-
lence traits among bacteria, and generally in the mobilization of the ge netic material, it has
been proposed that the entire pool of genetic information could be accessible to all members
of the bacterial community, considered as a single, heterogeneou s organism. In this regard
the emergence of a bias in codon usage for a gene carried by a plasmid is treated unfairly by
natural selection if the rate of the genetic information interchang e among conjugative bac-
teria of diﬀerent species is suﬃciently high. In fact because of the g enetic ﬂux, the plasmid
could visit a wide range of hosts, thus it could assay diﬀerent molecula r environments and
therefore the recombinant processes between homologous gene s maintain sequence homo-
geneity. Furthermore, an increased expression of a gene could be attained also by increasing
the number of copies of the plasmids .
The debate between neutralists and selectionists in evolutionary an d population genetics
addresses the question of how the superposition and the interact ions between the diﬀerent
constraints acting on the coding regions allow the tremendous amou nt of molecular genetic
variation that natural bacteria populations exhibit.
The comparison of the standard deviation of the CAIindex for thirteen sequences of D-
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenasegene(33gapgene; average CAI=0.830,standard
deviation 0.0025) from diﬀerent strains of E. colisequenced by Selander ( Selander et al.,
1991) and ten sequences of the alkaline phosphatase gene (843phoAgene,CAI= 0.344,
standard deviation 0.0059) sequenced by Milkman (DuBose & Hartl, 1 991), shows that
genes with higher bias in codon usage present lower levels of silent poly morphism.
This relation suggests that the more biased the codon usage of a ge ne among a bacteria
11
population, the less neutral the synonymous mutation.
Another fundamental question regards if and in what measure the bias in codon usage
participates in the control of gene expression. E. coliand bacteria in general are governed by
robust and plastic regulative mechanisms and even if regulative circu itry are parsimonious
in design, the present day gene networks have a large tool-kit of re gulative mechanisms,
both at the gene-protein and at the protein-protein interaction le vel.
Although the basic mechanisms act at the operonlevel, there are glo bal mechanisms that
allowthecelltorespondtochallenges, ashunger orstress situatio ns, withthecoordinateand
concerted expression of a network of operons. These mechanism s rely mainly in a cascade-
like activation of autogenously regulated stimulons or in the sigma sub unit variability that
makes the polymerases capable of recognizing diﬀerent types of pr omoters.
Within the operon there are mechanisms that diﬀerentiate the expr ession at the single
gene level, as for instance internal promoters, transcription ter mination signals, ribosome
binding sites with diﬀerent eﬃciency, mRNA degradation signals etc.
Although bias in codon usage has been proved to play a role in diﬀerent iating the ex-
pression levels of the genes within the operon, since these mechanis ms act sequentially, the
eﬀect of codon bias on the translation process probably depends la rgely on the optimization
of the other factors involved in the gene expression.
The amounts of the genes that present high values of CAI, for instance the ribosomal
and major outer membrane genes whose products are strongly re quired with respect to
other proteins for high duplication rates, are the eﬀective ﬁtness bottleneck of the bacterial
duplication machinery; thus the growth maximization strategy allows a cell to duplicate
faster because it lowers the time needed for translation.
The natural selection acts so much stronger in optimizing the trans lation of the very
highly expressed genes, with respect the other genes, because f urther increases in the trans-
lation eﬃciency of these latter genes reﬂects smaller improvements in the ﬁtness of the cell.
Considerations of this type have also been proposed and tested by Dykhuizen and col-
laborators for lacoperon in E. coli(Deanet al., 1986); they have demonstrated that the
contribution to the ﬁtness of the proteins encoded by the lacoperon is quite diﬀerent, being
the bottleneck of the lactose metabolic pathway the ﬂux of lactose into the cell, governed by
the concentration of the enzyme lac permease: thus the increase of catalytic activity of the
other enzymes coded by the lac operon (for example beta-galacto sidase) results in a very
little increase of the global ﬁtness of the pathway.
This could be a general principle in gene network architecture, i.e. th e potentiality of
increasing the globalﬁtness ofthe pathway could not beequally dist ributed among thegenes
belonging to a gene network.
Being generally accepted that the weaker the selective constraint , the wider the random
genetic drift (Li & Graur, 1991), the more relaxed situation of gen es whose product are not
required in large amount, allows high genetic variability consisting mainly in synonymous
substitutions.

IV. CONCLUSIONS
We have modeled some aspects of the molecular evolution of bacteria genomes by means
of the coupling between codon distributions and tRNAs abundance a nd the competitive
eﬀects of mutation and selection. Our model is consistent with a the rmodynamical inter-
pretation of this process, and gives a matematical support to the observed codon usage
distribution.
The evolution of a non synchronized population of bacteria is schema tically drawn as
alternated phases of exponential growth (feast) and selection ( famine), due either to star-
vation or to external reasons. In bacteria, because of the limiting amounts of nutrients
and the rapid ﬂuctuation in their availability in natural environment, t he periods of growth
are sporadic. Indeed, during these sporadic periods, the number of bacterial cells tends to
increase exponentially and the competition between genotypes cou ld develop very hardly,
because a light diﬀerence in the ﬁtness could result in a large diﬀerenc e in number and in
the aﬃrmation of the ﬁtter genotype.
Probably the two extreme conditions of feast and famine model larg e part of the ﬁtness
function of the bacterial genomes.
Bias in codon usage seems to be an adaptive response not only to fea st periods but also
to conditions of changing surroundings. In fact to survive famine p eriods would require
sophisticated regulative mechanisms leading to a shrewd managemen t of the resources as for
instancethestringentresponse, whiletheselectionforrapidoscilla tingperiodsmakethecells
maximize the sharp up-shift or down-shift production of some spec iﬁc proteins. According
to this hypothesis, bias in codon usage has revealed an interesting t ool to investigate the
ﬁtness bottleneck in metabolic pathways or in gene networks like str ingent response.
