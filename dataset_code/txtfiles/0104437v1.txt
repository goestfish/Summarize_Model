Abstract
Recent experiments revealed that the dielectric dispersio n spectrum of ﬁssion
yeast cells in a suspension was mainly composed of two sub-di spersions. The
low-frequency sub-dispersion depended on the cell length, while the high-
frequency one was independent of it. The cell shape eﬀect was s imulated by
an ellipsoidal cell model but the comparison between theory and experiment
was far from being satisfactory. Prompted by the discrepanc y, we proposed
the use of spectral representation to analyze more realisti c cell models. We
adopted a shell-spheroidal model to analyze the eﬀects of the cell membrane.
It is found that the dielectric property of the cell membrane has only a minor
eﬀectonthedispersionmagnituderatioandthecharacterist ic frequencyratio.
We further included the eﬀect of rotation of dipole induced by an external
electric ﬁeld, and solved the dipole-rotation spheroidal m odel in the spectral
representation. Good agreement between theory and experim ent has been
obtained.

I. INTRODUCTION
The polarization of biological cells has a wide scope of practical applica tions like manip-
ulation, trapping or separation of biological cells [1,2], and thus an acc urate characterization
of the polarization is needed. While the polarization of biological cells ca n be investigated
by the method of dielectric spectroscopy [3] as well as by the measu rement of ﬁeld-induced
cell movements [4,5], the former method has a much higher resolution [1]. For biological
cells, the main contribution to the dielectric dispersion is the structu ral (Maxwell-Wagner)
polarization eﬀects [1]. Because of the practical applications, ther e is a strong need for
intuitive models as well as simpliﬁed equations which describe the param eter dependence of
the polarization. Thus, various cell models have been proposed for the analysis of the po-
larization mechanisms. However, due to the complexity of existing th eories, these methods
have not yet found broader acceptance.
In this work, we propose the use of the spectral representation [6] for analyzing the cell
models. The spectral representation is a rigorous mathematical f ormalism of the eﬀective
dielectric constant of a two-phase composite material [6]. It oﬀers the advantage of the
separation of material parameters (namely the dielectric constan t and conductivity) from
the cell structure information, thus simplifying the study. From th e spectral representation,
one can readily derive the dielectric dispersion spectrum, with the dis persion strength as
well as the characteristic frequency being explicitly expressed in te rms of the structure
parameters and the materials parameters of the cell suspension ( see section II.B below).
The actual shape of the real and imaginary parts of the permittivit y over the relaxation
region can be uniquely determined by the Debye relaxation spectrum , parametrized by the
characteristic frequencies and the dispersion strengths. So, we can study the impact of these
parameters on the dispersion spectrum directly.
The plan of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we will review the
spectral representation theory [6] and show that the dielectric d ispersion spectrum of a
cell suspension can be expressed in terms of the spectral repres entation. In section III, we
2
will apply the spectral representation to the various cell models an d present an alternative
approach. We show that a better agreement with the experimenta l data can be achieved. In
section IV, we discuss the eﬀects of dipole rotation. We will show tha t the dipole rotation
eﬀect has a strong impact on the dispersion spectrum when the cells are suﬃciently long.
Discussion on further applications of our theory will be given.

dielectric constant ˜ ǫ1dispersed in a host medium of ˜ ǫ2. A uniform electric ﬁeld E0=E0ˆzis
applied along the z-axis. We brieﬂy review the spectral representation theory of th e eﬀective
dielectric constant to establish notations.
A. Spectral representation
The spectral representation is initiated by solving the diﬀerential e quation

˜sη(r)/parenrightbigg
∇φ(r)/bracketrightbigg
= 0, (1)
where ˜s= ˜ǫ2/(˜ǫ2−˜ǫ1) denotes the relevant material parameter and η(r) is the characteristic
function of the cell structure. The electric potential φ(r) can be solved formally [6]
φ(r) =−E0z+1
˜s/integraldisplay
dr′η(r′)∇′G0(r−r′)·∇′φ(r′), (2)
whereG0(r−r′) = 1/4π|r−r′|is the free space Green’s function. By denoting an operator
Γ =/integraldisplay
dr′η(r′)∇′G0(r−r′)·∇′, (3)
and the corresponding inner product
/angb∇acketleftφ|ψ/angb∇acket∇ight=/integraldisplay
drη(r)∇φ∗·∇ψ, (4)

it is easy to show that Γ is a Hermitean operator. Let snand|n/angb∇acket∇ightbe the eigenvalue and
eigenfunction of Γ such that Γ |n/angb∇acket∇ight=sn|n/angb∇acket∇ight, where 0 ≤sn<1 is a real eigenvalue. The
integral equation can be solved symbolically:
|φ/angb∇acket∇ight=−˜s
˜s−Γ|z/angb∇acket∇ightE0. (5)
From the solution, we obtain the electric ﬁeld and hence compute the eﬀective dielectric
constant ˜ǫein the spectral representation. We further deﬁne the reduced e ﬀective dielectric
function [6]:
F(˜s) = 1−˜ǫe

By inserting the complete set 1 =/summationtext

whereV1is the total volume of the suspending cells and pthe volume fraction of the cells.
B. Dielectric dispersion spectrum
For cells of arbitrary shape, the eigenvalue problem of the Γ operat or can only be solved
numerically. However, analytic solutions can be obtained for isolated spherical and ellip-
soidal cells. For dilute suspensions of prolate spheroidal cells, the c ells can be regarded as
noninteracting. The problem is simpliﬁed to the calculation of snand|n/angb∇acket∇ightwith a single cell,
which can be solved exactly. Only two of the Fnare nonzero, due to the orthogonality of
|n/angb∇acket∇ightwith|z/angb∇acket∇ight.

Thus, in subsequent studies, we restrict ourselves to two poles ( n= 1,2). From Eq.(7),
the eﬀective dielectric constant is written in the spectral represe ntation:
˜ǫe= ˜ǫ2/parenleftBigg

After substituting ˜ ǫ1=ǫ1+σ1/j2πfand ˜ǫ2=ǫ2+σ2/j2πfinto Eq.(10), where ǫandσ
are the real and imaginary parts of the complex dielectric constant , we rewrite the eﬀective
dielectric constant after simple manipulations:

whereǫHandσLare the high-frequency dielectric constant and the low-frequenc y con-

III. APPLICATIONS TO VARIOUS CELL MODELS
In a recent work [7], we adopted the spheroidal model (SM) to analy ze the cell suspen-
sions. Here we brieﬂy review the analytic results of the model:
s1=Lz, s2=Lxy, F1=1
3p, F2=2
3p.
5
where
Lz=−1
q2−1+q
(q2−1)3/2ln(q+/radicalBig
q2−1),
Lxy= (1−Lz)/2
are the depolarization factors along the z-axis andx-(ory-) axis of the prolate spheroid and
qis the ratio of length Lto diameter D.
In the spheroidal model, we neglected the presence of a cell membr ane. To study this
eﬀect, weputforwardtheshell-spheroidal model (SSM) here. In thiscase, thebiologicalcells
are modelled as shell-spheroidal ones with a spheroidal core of comp lex dielectric constant
ǫ1, covered with a confocal spheroidal shell of ǫs. For a small volume fraction pof shelled
spheroidal cells embedded in a host medium of complex dielectric const antǫ2, the eﬀective
dielectric constant ˜ ǫeis given by the dilute-limit expression:
˜ǫe= ˜ǫ2+p˜ǫ2(bz+2bxy).
wherebzis the dipole factor for a single-shelled spheroidal cell along the z-axis [9]:
bz=1
3(˜ǫs−˜ǫ2)[˜ǫs+Lz(˜ǫ1−˜ǫs)]+(˜ǫ1−˜ǫs)y[˜ǫs+Lz(˜ǫ2−˜ǫs)]
(˜ǫs−˜ǫ1)(˜ǫ2−˜ǫs)yLz(1−Lz)+[˜ǫs+Lz(˜ǫ1−˜ǫs)][˜ǫ2+Lz(˜ǫs−˜ǫ2)],
whereyis the volume ratio of core to the whole shelled spheroid, while bxyindicates the
dipole factor along the x- (ory-) axis, which can be obtained by replacing the subscript z
withxyin the expression of bz. As a matter of fact, the cell suspension consisting of shell-
spheroidal cells dispersed in a host medium is a three-phase system. Although the spectral
representation was generally valid for two-phase composites, we h ave recently shown that
it applies to composites of coated spheres as well as to coated sphe rical particles randomly
embedded in a host medium [10]. Note the sum rule/summationtextFn=pis no longer valid. Similarly,
one can show that the spectral representaton also applies to the present system consisting
of spheroidal cells with shells of complex dielectric constant ˜ ǫsdispersed in a host. The
eﬀective dielectric constant is then given by
˜ǫe= ˜ǫ2/bracketleftBigg
1−/parenleftBigg2/summationdisplay
n=1Fn
˜s−sn+N.P./parenrightBigg/bracketrightBigg

withN.P.being the nonresonant part which vanishes in the limit of unshelled sph eroidal
inclusions, where
s1=Lz[1+(x−1)y+Lz(−1+x+y−xy)]
x−Lz(x−1)2(y−1)+L2
z(x−1)2(y−1),
s2=Lxy[1+(x−1)y+Lxy(−1+x+y−xy)]
x−Lxy(x−1)2(y−1)+L2xy(x−1)2(y−1),
F1=px2y
3[x−Lz(x−1)2(y−1)+L2z(x−1)2(y−1)]2,
F2=2px2y
3[x−Lxy(x−1)2(y−1)+L2
xy(x−1)2(y−1)]2,
wherex= ˜ǫs/˜ǫ2. We omit the complicated expression for the nonresonant part her e. In
what follows, for the sake of convenience, we assume: (1) yis a constant for all coated
spheroid; (2) xis a real number.
In Fig.1, we plot the structure parameters Fnandsnversusxfor various yand for (a)
q= 3.46, (b) 7.17 and (c) 10 .24, respectively. In all case, p= 0.01. We ﬁnd Fnis strongly
dependent on yforx >0.5, whereas it is not the case for sn. It may be concluded that
the dielectric property of the cell membrane has a minor eﬀect on th e dispersion magnitude
ratio, but plays no role in the characteristic frequency ratio.
To investigate the validity of these models, we compare to experimen tal data, which was
extracted by using a temperature sensitive cell division cycle mutan t of ﬁssion yeast, cdc25-
22 [8]. Asami’s theory [8] results are also plotted for comparison. Fro m Fig.2, it is evident
that our model gives a better comparison with experimental data t han Asami’s theory. The
reason for the improvement lies in the introduction of the conductiv ity contrast tby using
of the spectral representation. As stated in Ref. [7], the large diﬀ erence between our model
and Asami’s theory is due to a large σ1≫σ2used in contrast to Asami’s claim σ1≈σ2[8].
We further ﬁnd that SSM provides a better ﬁt than SM for the dispe rsion magnitude ratio
∆ǫ1/∆ǫ2, while SSM yields the same results as those of SM for the frequency r atiofc
2/fc
1
(both curves overlap in the right panel of Fig.2), indicating that the dielectric property of a
cell membrane is indeed unimportant.

IV. EFFECTS OF DIPOLE ROTATION
According to the numerical results, we ﬁnd that the SSM provides a better ﬁtting with
previous experimental data than SM, but this improvement is actua lly too small. In other
words, the dielectric properties of a cell membrane does not play an important role in
dielectric dispersion spectrum. But, those numerical result will also show that both SM and
SSM cannot obtain a good agreement with experimental data. In th e presence of an electric
ﬁeld, cells of large length may rotate in favor of the applied ﬁeld, thus we propose another
model, namely the dipole-rotation spheroidal model (DRSM) to obta in a better ﬁtting.
When the cells are long enough, the rotation of dipole becomes very im portant with the
external electric ﬁeld under consideration, and the system is in gen eral anisotropic. We have
to take into account the eﬀect of dipole rotation on F1andF2, even for a weak electric
ﬁeld. Let us compute them from a thermodynamic consideration. We will show that they
in general depends on q.
Consider a spheroidal cell in an electric ﬁeld E0. Its long axis makes an angle θwith the
ﬁeld. The dipole energy of the cell is
Ed(q,θ) =−Re/bracketleftBigg˜ǫ2D3E2
0
16q(bzcos2θ+bxysin2θ)/bracketrightBigg
, (15)
wherebzandbxyare dipole factors along and perpendicular to the long axis:
bz=1
3(Lz−˜s), bxy=1
3(Lxy−˜s).
Eq.(15) can be understood by the energy approach. For simplicity, suppose the major axes
of the cells all lie along the electric ﬁeld, i.e., θ= 0, then the induced dipole moments of the
cells give a contribution to the eﬀective dielectric constant. In the d ilute limit,
˜ǫe= ˜ǫ2+3p˜ǫ2bz,
wherep=V1/Vis the volume fraction of the cells. For a ﬁxed external ﬁeld condition , the
total electrostatic energy density of the suspension is given by Et=−Re(˜ǫeE2
0/8π), which
is equal to −Re(˜ǫ2E2
0/8π)+Ed/V, and hence the desired results.
8
We showed that the conductivity contrast tattains a small negative value [7] and thus
the complex material parameter ˜ scan be approximated by t. Consequently, both bzandbxy
have positive values. The probability is given by the Boltzmann factor
ρ(q,θ) =Ae−Ed(q,θ)/kBT(16)
whereAis a normalization factor such that/integraltextρ(q,θ)dΩ = 1, where Ω is the solid angle,
dΩ = sinθdθdϕ. We can calculate F1andF2by the following integrals
F1(q) =p/integraldisplay
ρ(q,θ)cos2θdΩ, F2(q) =p/integraldisplay
ρ(q,θ)sin2θdΩ. (17)
TheF1(q)/F2(q) ratio may be obtained by integrating with respect to θfrom 0 toπ/2 by
symmetry. In the absence of an electric ﬁeld, Ed(q,θ) = 0 andρ(q,θ) equals to a uniform
distribution. In which case, we obtain F1=p/3 andF2= 2p/3, and hence F1/F2= 0.5.
Whentheelectricﬁeldisweakenough, theratioisstillconstantand F1/F2= 0.5. Otherwise,
the ratio will increase rapidly with q. Forq= 1,bz=bxyandF1/F2= 0.5 always. The
above result implies that both F1andF2depend strongly on qwhen there is an electric
ﬁeld. For large q,bz≫bxy, the spheroids tend to align with the applied ﬁeld and hence
F1/F2becomes very large.
It is found that the mean cell length depends on the cultivation time, whereas the
diameter is almost unchanged in an experiment [8], which will be applied to compare the
diﬀerentmodels. Inthefollowingnumerical calculation, withoutlosso fgenerality, weneglect
the small imaginary part of ˜ ǫ2, and deﬁne a new parameter ξ:
ξ=ǫ2D3E2
0
16kBT(18)
which characterizes the electric ﬁeld strength.
We can readily obtain the dispersion magnitude ratio ∆ ǫ1/∆ǫ2as well as the dispersion
frequency ratio fc
2/fc
1by substituting the results of F1(q)/F2(q) into Eqs.(12) and (13), and
settings1=Lzands2=Lxy. In Fig.3, F1/F2is plotted versus q. It is shown that F1/F2
depends strongly on the axial ratio q, especially for large qor strong magnitude of external
electric ﬁeld.
9
To compare with experimental data in Fig.2, we obtain good agreemen t in the DRSM
withξ= 0.017, which corresponds to a weak ﬁeld E0≈0.1 V/m. The results show that
dipolerotationindeedplaysanimportantroleinthedielectricdispersio n–wecannotneglect
the eﬀect of the rotation of dipole induced by the applied electric ﬁeld , especially when the
average length of cell is large. In addition, good agreement exists o nly for large cytoplasmic
conductivity, as attributed to a higher ion concentration in their cy toplasm to avoid the
shrinkage of cells due to a loss of water across the cell membrane.
V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
Here we would like to make a few comments. At low frequencies, the ce ll membrane
eﬀectively insulates the interior of cell. In other words, a potential builds up entirely over
the cell membrane, leaving the interior of cell rather inactive to the ﬁeld [1]. Thus ǫ1≪ǫ2
ands= 1+and it is reasonable to use s= 1.001 as ﬁtting parameter. On the other hand,
we assume that the host medium has low loss and σ2≈0 and at the same time a large
cytoplasmic conductivity σ1≫σ2. Thust= 0−and it is reasonable to use t=−0.0001 to
ﬁt the data.
The resulting equations [Eqs.(12) and (13)] are indeed simple equatio ns arising from
the spectral representation. These equations serve as a basis w hich describe the parameter
dependence of the polarization and thereby enhances the applicab ility of various cell models
for the analysis of the polarization mechanisms. In this connection, the shell-spheroid model
may readily be extended to multi-shell cell model. However, we believe that the multi-shell
nature of the cell may have a minor eﬀect on the dispersion magnitud e ratio as well as on
the characteristic frequency ratio.
In the presence of external electric ﬁelds, ﬁeld-induced motions s uch as rotation of cells,
dielectrophoretic motion or vibrational motion may have a signiﬁcant impact on the di-
electric dispersion spectrum. With the recent advent of experimen tal techniques such as
automated video analysis [11] as well as light scattering methods [2], t he cell movements can
10
be accurately monitored. For purely rotational motions, the distr ibution of surface charge
on the cell surfaces may deviate signiﬁcantly from the equilibrium dist ribution for cells at
rest, leading to a change in the polarization relaxation and in the dielec tric dispersion spec-
trum. In this regard, our recent work on dynamic electrorheologic al eﬀects [12], in which
the suspended particles can have rotational motions, may be applie d to cell rotational mo-
tions. InRef. [12], we found that the particles’ rotational motions do change the polarization
relaxation substantially.
In this work, we considered a monodisperse cell suspension, in which the cells are of the
same shape (i.e., same length and diameter). While the diameter of the cells may remain
constant during the cultivation process, the cells may possess a wid e distribution of cell
lengths[8]. Amodiﬁedtheory, whichtakesthedistributionoflengthin toaccount, isurgently
needed and our spectral representation theory will certainly help . In this connection, we
may apply a strong dc electric ﬁeld (in addition to the ac probe ﬁeld) to help separating
the long cells from the short ones. Our results indicate that even in a moderate ﬁeld, the
long cells can easily be aligned with the applied ﬁeld, while the short ones r emain essentially
randomly oriented. In this way, an emphasis of dispersion spectrum of the long cells can be
made possible.
In summary, prompted by the discrepancy between recent theor y and experiment on
ﬁssion yeast cells, we have proposed the use of spectral represe ntation to analyze more
realistic cell models. We adopted a shell-spheroidal model to analyze the eﬀects of the
cell membrane. It is found that the presence of a membrane has on ly a minor eﬀect on
the dispersion ratio, but plays no role in the frequency ratio. We fur ther included the
eﬀect of rotation of dipole induced by an external electric ﬁeld. It h as been found that the
dipole-rotation eﬀect plays an important role in the dispersion magnit ude, but it does not
change the characteristic frequency ratio. We obtained good agr eement between theory and
experiment when dipole-rotation eﬀect is included.
