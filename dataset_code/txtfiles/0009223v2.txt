Abstract
An SIRS epidemiological model for a vertically transmitted disease is discussed.
We give a complete global analysis in terms of three explicit threshold parame-
ters which respectively govern the existence and stability of an endemic proportion
equilibrium, the increase of the total population and the gr owth of the infective
population. This paper generalizes the results of Busenber g and van den Driessche.
Keywords: Epidemiological model, endemic proportions, global stability, Poincar ´ e in-
dex, threshold, vertical transmission.

1 Introduction
In 1990, a complete global analysis of an SIRS model of disease tran smission in a pop-
ulation with varying size was given by Busenberg and van den Driessch [4]. In an SIRS
epidemiological model, we divide the population into three groups, Sus ceptibles, Infec-
tives and Removeds, and the problem is to examine the behavior of th e size of each group
when the time goes to inﬁnity. They considered a disease with horizon al transmission,
that is a disease which is transmitted by contact between an infectiv e and a susceptible
individual. We intend to generalize their results for a vertically transm itted disease, that
is a disease which is also transmitted from infective parents to their n ewborns. The as-
sumption of vertical transmission has two consequences. First it c auses some newborns
1
to die and forces us to assume that the birth rate diﬀers from one g roup to another. (See
the demographic assumption in [3, 9, 10].) The second fact is that som e newborns are
infected, hence a group of newborns enter to the infective class [1 , 2, 6]. We also assume
that a part of these infected newborns are known and removed af ter their birth. We shall
show that the latter parameter can play an important role in the epid emic process.
We consider an SIRS epidemiological model for a vertically transmitte d disease. In
our model, the incidence function is of proportionate mixing type intr oduced by Nold
[11]. Natural births and deaths are assumed to be proportional to the class numbers with
diﬀerent rates. We also assume that a proportion of the infected n ewborns are known and
removed. We follow [4] to examine our model equation which is homogen eous of degree
one. We consider the proportions system and show that this syste m has no periodic
orbit in its feasibility region. This reduces our analysis to the discussio n of existence and
stability of rest points of a palnar system. The technique used here to show the uniquness
of endemic equilibria is based on the Poincar´ e index. This technique ha s no hard analysis
and can be easily applied to other similar systems [13, 14]. The reader c an verify that
our results hold for similar SIRI systems as well [7].
We ﬁrst in the next section state the model and a result concerning the non-existence
of certain types of solutions [5]. We consider the proportions syste m and prove that every
solution in the feasibility region tends to a rest point of this system. I n Section 3., we
introduce a quadratic planar system with the same dynamics as the p roportions system
and then we discuss the existence and stability of rest points of this quadratic planar
system. This gives a complete global analysis of the proportions sys tem which is used to
provide a global analysis of the original system is Section 4.
2 The model
In order to derive our model equations, we divide the population into three classes, the
susceptible, the infective and the removed individuals with total num bersS,IandR
respectively,. We set N=S+I+Rwhich is the total size of the population. The
following parameters are used in our model equations:
b0: per capita birth rate of susceptible individuals,
2
b1: per capita birth rate of infective individuals born uninfected,
β: per capita birth rate of infective individuals born infected,
b2: per capita birth rate of removed individuals,
d: per capita disease free death rate,
ε1: excess per capita death rate of infected individuals,
ε2: excess per capita death rate of removed individuals,
α: per capita removal rate of infective individuals,
γ: per capita recovery rate of removed individuals,
λ: eﬀective per capita contact rate of infective individuals.
As mentioned before, we assume that the infected newborns ente r the classes IandR
of proportions β1andβ2respectively, hence β=β1+β2. In this paper, all the above
parameters, are positive, however some of them can also be zero. These hypotheses yield
the following system of diﬀerential equation in R+
3, where “′” denotes the derivatives
with respect to t, the time.


S′= (b0−d)S+b1I+(b2+γ)R−λIS
N(2−1)
I′= (β1−d−ε1−α)I+λIS
N(2−2)
R′= (β2+α)I−(d+ε2+γ)R (2−3)
whereλIS
Nis of the proportionate or random mixing type [8, 11]. By adding the ab ove
three equations, the total population equation is
N=b0S+(b1+β−ε1)I+(b2−ε2)R−dN.
If we consider the proportions s=S
N,i=I
N,r=R
N, we get the following system of
equations.


s′=b0s+b1i+(b2+γ)r−b0s2−(b1+β+λ−ε1)is−(b2−ε2)sr(2−1)′
i′= (β1−ε1−α)i+(λ−b0)is−(b1+β−ε1)i2−(b2−ε2)ir (2−2)′
r′= (β2+α)i−(ε2+γ)r−b0sr−(b1+β−ε1)ir−(b2−ε2)r2(2−3)′
3
This system is called proportions system and the feasibility region of t his system is the
triangle
D={(s,i,r)|s≥0,i≥0,r≥0,s+i+r= 1}.
If we set Σ = s+i+rthen Σ′= (1−Σ)(b0s+(b1+β−ε1)i+(b2−ε2)r). Thus the plane
Σ = 1 is invariant. Moreover, on the sides of D, we have:


s= 0⇒s′=b1i+(b2+γ)r≥0,
i= 0⇒i′= 0 hence the line {i= 0}is invariant ,
r= 0⇒r′= (β2+α)i.
Therefore, Dis positively invariant. On the invariant line {Σ = 1}∩{i= 0}, we have
r′=−(ε2+γ)r−b0r(1−r)−(b2−ε2)r2=−(b0+ε2+γ)r+(b0−b2+ε2)r2.
It follows that this invariant line contains two rest points, the Diseas e-Free Equilibrium
(1,0,0) and possibly another one which is outside of D. It is easy to see tha t the DFE
attracts the side D∩{i= 0}. Furthermore, our vector ﬁeld is strictly inward on the other
sides ofD. Thus◦
D, the interior of D, is positively invariant too. The following theorem
reduces our problem to the discussion of existence and stability of r est points in D.
Theorem 2.1. Theω-limit set of any solution for the system (2 −1)′−(2−3)′with
initial point in Dis a rest point in D.
Proof. SinceDis compact and positively invariant, the ω-limit set of any solution with
initial point in Dis a compact nonempty invariant subset of D. Here we use the Poincar´ e-
Bendixon theorem and the terminology used to prove it [12]. In the ne xt section, we will
see that this system has at most three rest points in D. Thus it satisﬁes the assumptions
of Poincar´ e-Bendixon theorem. We follow [4, 5] and deﬁne the vect or ﬁeldg= (g1,g2,g3)

wheref1, f2andf3are the right hand side of (2 −1)′, (2−2)′and (2−3)′reduced to

some computations [7], we get

.
Since the DFE is the only invariant subset of ∂D(i.e. the boundary of D), theω-limit
set must have some regular point in◦
Dif it is not a rest point. Let xbe such a regular
point and hbe the ﬁrst return map (Poincar´ e map) deﬁned on a tranversal a tx. For a
pointynearxon the transversal, Let Vbe the region surrounded by the orbit Γ from y
toh(y) and the segment between them. (This region is known as Bendixon S ack, Sec Fig

Sinceg.f= 0 andh(x) =x, the right hand side of the above equality tends to zero when
ytends to x, but the left hand side tends to the integral over the region bound ed by the
ω-limit set, this is a contradiction since (curl g).(1,1,1)<0 in◦

3 The planar system
using therelation s+i+r= 1, we see thatour system isessentially two dimensional. Thus
we can eliminate one of the variable to arrive at the following quadratic planar system:
/braceleftBigg
i′= (λ+β1−b0−ε1−α)i+(b0+ε1−λ−b1−β)i2+(b0+ε2−λ−b2)ir(3−1)
r′= (β2+α)i−(b0+ε2+γ)r+(b0+ε1−b1−β)ir+(b0+ε2−b2)r2(3−2)
5
The dynamics of the system (2 −1)′−(2−3′) inDis equivalent to the dynamics of this
planar system in the positively invariant region D1={(i,r) :i≥0,r≥0,i+r≤1}.
This quadratic system has at most four rest points and since D1misses a rest point on
i= 0, there are at most three rest points in D1. One of these rest points is the origin
which comes from the DFE. The matrix of the linearization of the syst em (3−1),(3−2)
at the origin is:/bracketleftBigg
λ+β1−b0−ε1−α 0
β2+α −(b0+ε2+γ)/bracketrightBigg
with the eigenvalues λ+β1−b0−ε1−αand−(b0+ε2+γ). Now we deﬁne the ﬁrst
threshold parameter R0=λ+β1
b0+ε1+αwhich governs the stability of the origin.
Theorem 3.1. The origin is globally asymptotically stable in the feasibility region D1
whenR0≤1 and it is a saddle point when R0>1.
Proof. By Theorem 2.1. it is enough to prove that if R0≤1, then the origin is the only
rest point in D1. If there exists a rest point in◦
D1, we have i′= 0 andi/ne}ationslash= 0 at this point.
Thus it belongs to the line
(λ+β1−b0−ε1−α)+(b0+ε1−λ−b1−β)i+(b0+ε2−λ−b2)r= 0.(3−3)
Sinces′= 0 at this point, from (2 −1)′we obtain
b0s+b1i+(b2+γ)r−b0s2−(b1+β+λ−ε1)is−(b2−ε2)sr= 0.
and by using the relation s+i+r= 1, we can write
b1i+(b2+γ)r+(b0+ε1−b1−β−λ)is+(b0+ε2−b2)sr= 0.
Multiplying (3-3) by ( −s) and adding it to the above expression, we get the following
equality
b1i+(b2+γ)r+λsr+(b0+ε1+α−λ−β1)s= 0.
But the left hand side is positive when R0≤1 and this is a contradiction. /square
WhenR0>1, the origin is a saddle point and it does not attract any point of
D1−{i= 0}. Thus the orbits with initial point in D1− {i= 0}must be attracted by
6
some rest points in◦
D1by Theorem 2.1. These rest points belong to the line (3-3) and
the conic section
r′= (β2+α)i−(b0+ε2+γ)r+(b0+ε1−b1−β)ir+(b0+ε2−b2)r2= 0.
It follows that there are at most two rest points in◦
D1. Notice that a nondegenerate rest
point of the planar system is obtained by a transverse intersection of the line (3-3) and
the above conic section. The following lemma has two immediate conseq uences which will
be very helpful.
Lemma 3.2. The trace of the linearization of the system (3-1),(3-2) at a rest p oint in
◦
D1is negative.
Proof: We compute the trace at a rest point.
∂i′
∂i= (λ+β1−b0−ε1−α)+2(b0+ε1−λ−b1−β)i+(b0+ε2−λ−b2)r,
∂r′
∂r=−(b0+ε2+γ)+(b0+ε1−b1−β)i+2(b0+ε2−b2)r.
Fromi′= 0 and r′= 0 at a rest point, we can write
∂i′
∂i= (b0+ε1−λ−b1−β)iand∂r′
∂r= (b0+ε2−b2)r−(β2+α)i
r.
Sinces′=b1i+ (b2+γ)r+ (b0+ε1−λ−b1−β)si+ (b0+ε2−b2)sr, it follows that
(b0+ε1−λ−b1−β)si+(b0+ε1−λ−b1−β)sr <0 and hence∂i′
∂i+∂r′
∂r<0./square
Corollary 3.3. The system (3-1),(3-2) has no source point in◦
D1
Corollary 3.4. Every nondegenerate rest point in◦
D1is hyperbolic.
Theorem 3.5. IfR0>1, then there exists a unique rest point ( i∗,r∗) in◦
D1which is
hyperbolic and attracts D1−{i= 0}.
7
Proof. WhenR0>1, the origin is a saddle point with the unstable eigenvector
/bracketleftBigg
λ+β1−b0−ε1−α+b0+ε2+γ
β2+α/bracketrightBigg
.
SinceR0>1, we have λ+β1−b0−ε1−α >0 and hence this vector belongs to the ﬁrst
quadrant of the plane ( i,r). Since◦
D1is positively invariant it follows that a branch of
the unstable manifold of the origin lies in◦
D1. (See Figure 3.1.)

We choose this Jordan curve so that it contains all rest points in◦
D1. If there are two
rest points in◦
D1, they are obtain by a transverse intersection of the line (3-3) and the
conic section r′= 0 and hence both are nondegenerate. Thus their Poincar´ e index must
be±1 which contradicts IX(C) = 1. Therefore there is a unique rest point in◦

With a slight perturbation in γ, we will have either two transverse intersection in◦

nothing. ( γappears only in the coeﬃcient of rinr′= 0 and does not appear in (3-3) and
R0). This is a contradiction with the uniqueness of the rest point in◦
D1proven above. /square
Theorem 3.1. and Theorem 3.5. provide a complete global analysis of t he planar
system (3-1),(3-2) in◦
D1. Since the dynamics of this system in◦
D1is equivalent to the
dynamics of proportions system (2 −1)′−(2−3)′inD, we have proved the following
result which gives a complete global analysis of the proportions syst em in the feasibility
regionD.
Theorem 3.6. Consider the proportions system (2 −1)′−(2−3)′.
(i) IfR0≤1, then the disease free equilibrium proportions (1 ,0,0) is globally asymp-
totically stable in D.
(ii) IfR0>1,thenthereisauniquerestpoint( s∗,i∗,r∗)whichisgloballyasymptotically
stable in D−{i= 0}.
4 Analysis of the model equations
Consider theoriginalmodel equation(2-1)-(2-3)andrecall that thepopulationequationis
N′=b0S+(b1+β−ε1)I+(b2−ε2)R−dN.Thus
N′
N=b0s+(b1+β−ε1)i+(b2−ε2)r−d. (4−1)
IfR0≤1, then ( s,i,r)−→(1,0,0) by Theorem 3.6., henceN′
N−→b0−d. Moreover if
R0>1 andI >0, then (s,i,r)−→(s∗,i∗,r∗), i.e. the unique rest point in◦
D1, and
N′
N−→b0s∗+(b1+β−ε)i∗+(b2−ε2)r∗−d.
We deﬁne the second threshold parameter which governs the tota l population as follows.
R1=

b0
difR0≤1,
b0s∗+(b1+β)i∗+b2r∗
d+ε1i∗+ε2r∗ifR0>1.
9
SinceI= 0 is invariant with a linear equation, we may assume that I >0. Now from
(2-2), we write
I′
I= (β1−d−ε1−α)+λs. (4−2)
IfR0≤1, thenI′
I−→β1−d−ε1−α+λand ifR0>1,I′
I−→β1−d−ε1−α+λs∗.
So we deﬁne the third threshold parameter which governs the tota l number of infective
individuals.
R2=

β1+λ
d+ε1+αifR0≤1,
β1+λs∗
d+ε1+αifR0>1.
Notice that ddoes not appear in the proportions system and hence ( s∗,i∗,r∗) is indepen-
dent ofd. The following results provide a rather complete global analysis of th e model
equations (2-1)-(2-3).
Lemma 4.1. IfI(t)≤Mfor every t≥t0, thenR(t)−→0 and if I(t)−→ ∞, then
R(t)−→ ∞.
Proof. From (2-3), we have R′(t) = (β2+α)I(t)−(d+ε2+γ)R(t). IfI(t)≤M
fort≥t0, thenR′(t)≤M(β2+α)−(d+ε2+γ)R(t) and by Granvell’s inequality
[12],R(t)≤M(β2+α)e−(d+ε2+γ)(t−t0)which follows that R(t)−→0. Now suppose that
I(t)−→ ∞. Then by (2-3), we have R′(t)+(d+ε2+γ)R(t) = (β2+α)I(t) which implies
thatd
dt(R(t)e(d+ε2+γ)t) = (β2+α)I(t)e(d+ε2+γ)t. For every M∈R+, there is a t0∈Rsuch
thatI(t)> Mfort > t0. Thus
R(t)e(d+ε2+γ)t−R(t0)e(d+ε2+γ)t0=/integraldisplayt
t0(β2+α)I(t)e(d+ε2+γ)t> M(β2+α)/integraldisplayt

R(t0)−M(β2+α)
d+ε2+γ/parenrightbigg
e−(d+ε2+γ)(t−t0)+M(β2+α)

Sincee−(d+ε2+γ)(t−t0)goes to zero as t−→ ∞,R(t)>M(β2+α)
2(d+ε2+γ)for large values of t.
It means that R(t)−→ ∞./square
Theorem 4.2. (i) IfR1>1, thenN(t)−→ ∞and ifR1<1, thenN(t)−→0.
(ii) IfR2>1, then (I(t),R(t))−→(∞,∞) and ifR2<1, then (I(t),R(t))−→(0,0).
10
Proof: First suppose that R0≤1 which implies that ( s,i,r)−→(1,0,0) by Theorem
3.6. ThusN′
N−→b−dby (4-1) andI′
I−→β1−d−ε1−α+λby (4-2). If R1<1,
thenb−d <0, hence N(t)−→0. Similarly if R1>1, thenb−d >0, hence N(t)−→0.
Furthermore If R2<1, thenB1−d−ε1−α+λ <0, hence I(t)−→0 and by the above
lemmaR(t)−→0. Similarly if R2>1, thenβ1−d−ε1−α+λ >0, hence I(t)−→ ∞
and by the above lemma R(t)−→ ∞.
Now suppose that R0>1. We assumed that I(t)>0, hence i >0 and (s,i,r)−→
(s∗,i∗,r∗) by Theorem 3.6. ThusN′
N−→b0s∗+(b1+β−ε1)i∗+(b2−ε2)r∗−dwhich is
positive if R1>1, henceN(t)−→ ∞and negative if R1<1, henceN(t)−→0. Moreover
I′
I−→(β1−d−ε1−α) +λs∗which is positive if R2>1, hence I(t)−→ ∞and then
R(t)−→ ∞by the above lemma. Similarly β1−dε1−α+λs∗<0 ifR2<1 and then
(I(t),R(t))−→(0,0)./square
We summarize our results in the following table which is the same as Table 1. in [4].
R0R1R2N−→(s,i,r)−→(S,I,R)−→
≤1<1<1α0(1,0,0) (0,0,0)
>1<1<1α0(s∗,i∗,r∗)(0,0,0)
≤1>1<1∞(1,0,0)(∞,0,0)
≤1>1>1∞(1,0,0)(∞,∞,∞)
>1>1>1α∞(s∗,i∗,r)(∞,∞,∞)
αGivenR0andR1, this condition is automatically satisﬁed.
Conclusion Remarks. Here we will make some comparison between the result in [4]
and the above results.
1. If we set b0=b1=b2=bandβ1=β2=β= 0 in the system (2-1)-(2-3), we obtain
the system (2-1)-(2-3) in [4]. Moreover by these assumptions, we getR0=λ
b+ε1+α,
R2=

b
difR0≤1,

λ

which are the same threshold parameters as in [4].
2. Comparing their threshold parameters with our ones, we see tha t the eﬀect of
b0,b1andb2appears more clearly instead of b. For example when R0>1, ourR1is
b0s∗+(b1+β)i∗+b2r∗
d+ε1i∗+ε2r∗, but they obtain R1=b
d+ε1i∗+ε2r∗in which the eﬀects of b0,b1andb2are
hidden in b.
3. There are two vertical transmission parameter, β1andβ1, in our model. The eﬀect
ofβ1inR0andR2is crucial. Since β1+β2=β, we can decrease β1by increasing β2.
Therefore removing more infected newborns causes more safe sit uation.
