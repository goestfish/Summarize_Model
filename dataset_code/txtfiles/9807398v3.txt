Abstract
We introduceatoy modelfor interacting populations connec ted by mutations
and limited by a shared resource. We study the presence of Eig en’s error
threshold and mutational meltdown. The phase diagram of the system shows
that the extinction of the whole population due to mutationa l meltdown can
occur well before an eventual error threshold transition.

The evolutionary process is due to the balance between two opposit e forces: random
mutation and natural selection. Mutations tend to increase the ge netic diversity, while
selection discriminates the individuals more apt to survive. A simple mod el for evolution of
self-reproducing molecules was proposed by Eigen [1]. The inheritable characters (genotype)
are modeled by a binary string g= (g1,g2,...,g L),gi∈ {0,1}, of ﬁxed length L(haploid
individuals). The genotypic space is thus a binary hypercube of Ldimensions. One can
think of the zeros as good genes (or basis) and the ones as bad gen es. We shall denote the
set of individuals sharing the same genotype as a strain.
The selection is modeled by the concept of ﬁtness, which can be deﬁn ed as the survival
probability or birth rate of a strain in the limit of zero mutations and va nishing population
(in order to avoid overcrowding eﬀects). The selection acts on the external characters of an
individual, i.e. its phenotype m, which can be considered a (generally degenerated) function
of the genotype m(g). The simplest phenotype (used also in Eigen’s model) is a decreasing
function of the fraction of bad genes in the genotype: m(g) = (1/L)/summationtext
igi. The mutations,
occurring with probability µ, reverse the value of a single bit (point mutations) and thus
couple diﬀerent strains.
The classiﬁcation of strains into species is based both on the phenot ypic traits and on
the genotypic information: for strains to belong to the same specie s, they must be connected
by mutations and form an isolated cluster in the phenotypic space. T his last requirement is
guaranteed, even in an almost ﬂat ﬁtness landscape, by competitio n [2], which “eliminates”
the less adapted strains phenotypically near to a ﬁttest one.
For asharp peak landscape the genotype g= (0,0,...) has higher ﬁtness α, and all
other genotypes have the same lower ﬁtness β: the ﬁtness landscape is almost ﬂat. Two
diﬀerent regimes are possible: in one phase the asymptotic limit is a bell shaped distribution
in phenotypic space (quasispecies), centered around the master sequence; in the other the
most common phenotype is no more the ﬁttest one. The shape of th e distribution in this
second phase is dominated by combinatorial factors, approaching a Gaussian in the limit of
very large mutation rates, with almost no diﬀerence among strains.
The transition between these two regimes, triggered by the mutat ion rate µor by the
length of the genome L, is called error threshold . While the original results have been
obtained for an inﬁnite population, this transition, disregarding the eﬀects of ﬂuctuations,
depends slightly on the size of population [3,4]. The error transition ha s the character of a
true phase transition (ﬁrst order) for an inﬁnite genome length L[5].
A related eﬀect, eﬀective in small populations, is called Muller’s ratche t [6] orstochastic
escape[7,8]: in absence of back mutations there is a ﬁnite probability that the master
sequence will be lost due to ﬂuctuations. Since it relies on a random pr ocess, the average
escape time is however of order of the exponential of the size of th e strain [9], and thus this
eﬀect is relevant only for very small populations. In practice, this is the ultimate extinction
mechanism, eﬀective when another cause has reduced enough the population. The error
threshold, on the other hand, does not depend on the size of the t otal population. In the
following we shall neglect to consider the inﬂuence of ﬂuctuations.

When the total population size is not kept ﬁxed, the presence of un favorable mutations
reduces the average ﬁtness, and this can lead to the extinction of the whole population, a
phenomenon which is called mutational meltdown [10–12]. The presence of this eﬀect in
the Eigen model has been shown numerically in Ref. [13].
In this work we propose a simple minimal model which is able to exhibit bot h the
error threshold and the mutational meltdown. Due to the form of t he ﬁtness function,
the dynamics of the population is fundamentally determined by the ﬁt test strains. Let us
indicate with Xthe number of individuals sharing the master sequence, with Ythe number
of individuals whose genotype has m= 1, and with Zall others individuals. We assume
also non-overlapping generations, so that we can consider a discre te time dynamics with
unit equal to the generation time.
During reproduction, individuals from strain Xcan mutate, contributing to Y, andY
toZ, with mutation rate µL. We disregard the possibility of back mutations from ZtoY
and from YtoX. This last assumption is equivalent to the limit of a large genome, which
is the case for existing organisms. We also introduce the reproduct ion accuracy q, deﬁned in
term ofµLasq= 1−µL. Due to the assumption of large L, the multiplicity of mutations
fromm= 1 tom >1 (L−1) is almost the same of that from m= 0 tom−1 (L).

that the eﬀective reproduction rate of a population is proportiona l to 1−N/K, where

where the prime denote quantities at following time step. Obviously all population dies if

We characterize the error threshold by the fact that the ﬁttest phenotype is no longer
the most common one, its phase boundary is given by x=y. Evaluating this condition at
the ﬁxed point Bwe get from Eqs. (5)
qe=α
2α−β. (7)
The mutational meltdown corresponds to the vanishing of the tota l population N= 0,
while not changing its distribution. Thus, from Eq. (6) we have
qm=1
α. (8)
Our deﬁnition of the error threshold transition needs some remark s: in the original
work [1] the error threshold is located at the maximum mean Hamming d istance, which
corresponds to the maximum spread of population. In the limit of ver y large genomes these
two deﬁnitions agree, since the transition becomes very sharp [5]. F or ﬁnite populations, a
possible transition can be located in correspondence of the vanishin g of the probability of
ﬁnding the master sequence [3,13], in a way similar to Muller’s ratchet.
However, since the master sequence has always an higher eﬀective ﬁtness than other
strains, this implies that for β <1 the error threshold is only a transient phenomenon before
extinction, unless the population is artiﬁcially kept ﬁnite, as in Ref. [3]. This mutation-
induced extinction has been investigated numerically by Malarz and Tig gemann in Ref. [13].
The condition for the disappearance of the master sequence is x′/x <1 in the limit of
vanishing x. Denoting arbitrarily this transition as Muller’s ratchet’s one, we obt ain from
the ﬁrst of Eqs. (2)
qr=β
α. (9)

This transition coincides with the mutational meltdown for β= 1.
In Figure 1 we plot the phase diagram of the three transitions for so me diﬀerent values
ofβ. We note that the error threshold depends only on the ratio α/β(i.e. on the relative
ﬁtness of strains); on the other hand, the mutational meltdown t hreshold involves the whole
population, so it depends on the absolute value of the ﬁtness α. Forβ <1 the mutational
meltdown transition crosses the error threshold, so one can obse rve both extinction of the
quasispecies distribution or the error threshold in a stable populatio n, according with the
parameters.
The physical relevant conditions for the extinction of the master s equence is β <1, for
which also the Ystrains vanish; otherwise back mutations cannot be neglected. Ou r toy
model can approximate the M2 model by Malarz and Tiggemann, in whic h only one bit
is mutated with probability Pmut, and thus q= 1−Pmut. In that model the selective
advantage α/βof the master sequence is given by the number of oﬀsprings, Nrep, whileβ
is given by the reproduction probability Prep. Since they observed the extinction of the
master sequence as error threshold, their data must be compare d with Eq. (9), thus
Pmut= 1−1
Nrep
corresponds to their error threshold transition and
Pmut= 1−1
PrepNrep
to the mutational meltdown. The phase diagram of this model is repo rted in Figure 2. The
numerical data of Ref [13] are well reproduced, except for a small shift of the error threshold
transition.
In summary we ﬁnd that for a very steep ﬁtness function ( α≫β), by increasing the
mutation rate µor the genome length Lone always observes the error threshold; but for
moderately ﬁtness diﬀerence among strains the mutational meltdo wn causes the extinction
of the whole population while retaining the quasispecies distribution.
