Abstract
Two simple (rotator and one-particle) mechanistic models a re suggested
to describe simultaneously at a minimal level of sophistica tion two basic func-
tions ofF 1-ATPase: amotor regime drivenbyATP hydrolysisandits inve rted
function as ATP synthesis. This description is consistent w ith the so-called
rotary binding-change mechanism, a milestone of functioni ng ATP synthase,
and uses a stepping (driving) function associated with two s equences of time
instants, at which hydrolysis and synthesis reactions occu r. It is useful to
analyse experimental data and numerical simulations indee d predict corre-
sponding dynamic behavior.

Recently, the modeling of molecular motors - enzymes which transdu ce chemical energy
into directed mechanical motion - based on the idea of gaining useful work by rectiﬁcation
of zero-mean noise ﬂuctuations has attracted considerable atte ntion [1] and several models
exploiting the so-called ratchetmechanism have been elaborated (see, e.g., Refs. [2–9], to
1
mention a few). In this context, ATP (adenosinetriphosphate) sy nthase shown schematically
in Fiq. 1, being a realistic molecular engine of great interest nowadays [10], should also be
studied from the point of view of biological physics [11]. This machinery is composed of
two rotary motors: a membrane-embedded unit F 0and water-surrounded F 1-ATPase (also
called F 1) connected by a coiled-coil γsubunit. ATP synthase works as a reversible motor-
pump machine: the proton ﬂow through F 0is believed to create a clockwise (when F 1is
viewed from the F 0side) torque that turns γ, whereupon ATP molecules are sequentially
synthesized at three catalytic sites, one on each βsubunit. Vice versa, ATP hydrolysis,
which also occurs sequentially on β’s, but in the opposite direction, has been demonstrated
to make γrotate backwards, converting F 0into a proton pump. In this case, γis driven
by sequential hinge-bending motions of β’s, like a crankshaft by the pistons in a car engine
(for more details see Ref. [12]). In this paper, we focus on F 1-ATPase and consider its
operation in both hydrolysis (as a motor) and synthesis (as a synth esizer) directions, using
in parallel two simple mechanistic analogs: a plane rotator and a partic le subjected to a
periodic potential. Our description is consistent with Boyer’s binding- change mechanism
[13,14], the recent ﬁndings of Cherepanov et al.and Junge et al.[15] on elasticity properties
of theγsubunit, as well as with the experimental results of Yasuda et al.[16].
The structure of F 1-ATPase and the mechanics of motions within it are too complex to
allow a detailed description of all interactions and motions of its diﬀere nt parts, i.e., the
threeβand oneγsubunits [10,12–14,17–19]. Therefore, it would be useful to describ e this
very sophisticated three-dimensional system, using simple mechan ical equivalents (springs,
particles, etc.) and keeping the main features of rotary dynamics f ound in previous studies,
such as the modeling of Oster and Wang [12] and others [10,15–19]. Th is approach, “from
complexity to simplicity”, is often used in biological physics. The typica l example of such
a modeling is the propagation of a nerve impulse on the giant axon of th e squid, where
insight in the dynamics of the original Hodgkin-Huxley equations [20] h as been obtained by
reduction to the minimal FitzHugh-Nagumo system [21].
Here the three-dimensional andfour-bodyinteraction inthe β3γsubcomplex is suggested
2
tobeeﬀectivelydescribedasacouplingofaplanarrotatoroflength R0centeredinthemiddle
of an equilateral triangle (see left panels of Figs. 2 and 3) with three equivalent catalytic
sites (denote them by numbers 1, 2, and 3) at the vertices of the t riangle. Obviously, this
rotor-statorinteraction, resulting inacrankshaft-likerotation ofγ(andcooperativecatalysis
onβ’s), is a periodic function: U(θ+2π) =U(θ), where θdenotes the angular position of
the rotator (positive if counter-clockwise). The mechanical equiv alent of a driving torque
onγcan be chosen as a stretched spring or an eﬀective particle displace d from equilibrium
in the periodic potential U(θ) as illustrated in the left and the right panels of Figs. 2 and
3, respectively. At each site i= 1,2,3, a spring Kiis attached connecting this site with the
rotator. All the three springs are supposed to be identical, but on ly one spring is allowed to
be switched on, while the other two are switched oﬀ, at a time. Then s equential switching
the springs will result in a power stroke on γ. Without loss of generality, the rotor-stator
potential (given in units of the hydrolysis energy W≃80 pN·nm) can be written as
U(θ) = [r(θ)−a]2/(l−a)2, (1)
wherea=d/R0is the length of each spring Kibeing undistorted, r(θ) =
/radicalBig
1+(1+ a)2−2(1+a)cosθthe instantaneous spring length, and l=r(±2π/3).
Let us now describe how our spring system operates in both the hyd rolysis and synthesis
directions and how it can be coordinated with ATP hydrolysis/synthe sis reactions at the
catalytic sites of the βsubunits. According to Boyer’s hypothesis [13] supported by the
structural studies by Walker and coworkers [14], and recently by d irect observation of Noji
et al. [18], each site 1, 2, or 3 can be found at least in one of the three sta tes: T (ATP
binding), E (empty), and D (ADP binding), at a time. Structurally, th ey are arranged as
T, E, and D counter-clockwise (see Figs. 1-3) and can be put on the θaxis at the lattice
(“catalytic”) sites with spacing 2 π/3, as shown in the right panels of Figs. 2 and 3. The
dimensionless periodic (with period 2 π) potential U(θ) [not necessary of the form (1)] is
supposed to be “rigidly tied” to this lattice, so that its minima are alway s found at sites
with state T. We assume this potential to satisfy the normalization c onditions: U(T)= 0
3
andU(D)= 1. The last constarint means that the potential energy of th e eﬀective particle
in state D is equal to the free hydrolysis energy W.
Consider ﬁrst the hydrolysis direction when F 1operates as a motor (see Fig. 2). Let
initiallythe γsubunit(rotor)befoundatequilibrium, performingtherethermal ﬂuctuations.
This state is represented by spring K1being undistorted and switched on state T, while
the springs at the other sites ( K2andK3) are switched oﬀ. In the particle equivalent, this
situation is represented in the right panel of Fig. 2(a) by a particle ﬂ uctuating in the vicinity
ofoneoftheminimaofthepotential U(θ), i.e., instateT.WhenanATPmoleculesettlesinto
site2whichisfoundatthistimeinstateE,itappearsboundthere, re sultinginATPbinding:
E→T. According to the rotary binding-change mechanism [13,14], this tr ansition implies
the two conformational changes at the next two sites: release of the inorganic phosphate
(P) and the ADP (adenosinediphosphate) molecule from site 2 (D →E), and hydrolysis of
the ATP molecule located at site 3 (T →D). After these state transitions have occured,
springK1is switched oﬀ, while spring K2is switched on, causing the power stroke on the
rotor as demonstrated by Fig. 2(b). Therefore the rotor is drive n forward before it reaches
a new equilibrium state, stepping forward by 2 π/3. Correspondingly, as shown in the right
panel, the potential U(θ) steps forward (to the right) by 2 π/3, so that the particle appears
to be lifted uphill at the level U= 1, thereafter sliding down and ﬁnally dwelling in the
next potential minimum before the next sequence of conformation al changes takes place.
However, if occasionally two sequential conformational transition s occur very close in time
resulting in two almost simultaneous potential steps forward, the p article appears on the
positive slope of the potential U(θ), sliding thereafter down backwards. When the time
between two sequential transitions is still short, but long enough f or the particle to make
a descent close to equilibrium, the double potential step forward will result in the double
sliding down on the negative slope. Indeed, both such occasional st eps ofγloaded by an
actin ﬁlament were observed in experiments [16,18,19]. We denote the sequence of time
instants when hydrolysis events occur by {t+
i}∞
i=1and call it a “hydrolysis sequence”.
Consider now the case, when an external torque (e.g., from the sid e of F 0) is applied to
4
theγsubunit clockwise, as shown in the left panel of Fig. 3(a). According to Cherepanov et
al.and Junge et al.[15], the external energy of torsion is stored as an elastic strain en ergy of
γ. When the rotator turns clockwise totally by 2 π/3, the torsional energy is liberated for the
synthesis of one ATP molecule at the site being in state D. Then spring K1is switched oﬀ,
while spring K3ison, bringing thesystem tothezero-energy level ( U= 0). Equivalently, the
particle “drops down” to equilibrium state T [see Fig. 3(b)]. These mec hanical equivalents
are again in accordance with Boyer [13] for ATP synthesis, when the conformational change
D→T implies the transitions at the other two sites: T →E and E →D. We denote the
sequence of time instants when synthesis events occur by {t−
j}∞
j=1and call it a “synthesis
sequence”.
Summarizing, one can present the diagram shown in Fig. 4, which desc ribes the elastic
strain energy of the torsional rotor-stator interaction as a fun ction ofθ, combining both the
hydrolysis and synthesis directions. Arrows show the rotational d irection under hydrolysis
(θ >0,motorregime) and synthesis ( θ <0,synthesizer regime).
In experiments [16,18,19], the γsubunit was loaded by an actinﬁlament rotating in a vis-
cous solution. Therefore, we approach the overdamped limit and th e equation of motion for
the rotator driven by a periodic potential U(θ) ﬂuctuating stepwise forward and backwards
by 2π/3 (due to hydrolysis power strokes and an external load torque Tl) reads
Γ˙θ=−W∂θU[θ−2πS(t)/3]−Tl(θ,t)+ξ(t), (2)
where Γ is a viscous friction coeﬃcient, U(θ) is normalized by U(2πn) = 0 and U[2π(n±
1/3)] = 1,n= 0,±1,..., andξ(t) is the Brownian torque with the auto-correlation function
/an}bracketle{tξ(t)ξ(t′)/an}bracketri}ht= 2ΓkBTδ(t−t′), where kBdenotes Boltzmann’s constant and Tis the absolute
temperature. The stepping (driving) function

The hydrolysis sequence {t+
i}is a random process determined by ATP concentration
([ATP]). We deﬁne it through two characteristic duration times ∆ tDand ∆tTby the recur-
rence relation
t+
i+1=t+
i+∆tD+2ζi+1∆tT, i= 1,2,..., (4)
where each ζi∈[0,1] is a random value with uniform distribution (since ATP concentratio n
is supposed to be constant in the solution). The interval ∆ tTis large for low [ATP], but
tends to zero as [ATP] is suﬃciently high. Therefore one can assume that ∆tT=AT/[ATP]
with some constant AT>0. The interval ∆ tDtriggers the hydrolysis reactions by release of
P and ADP on the next site of the stator. In the limit of low concentra tion of nucleotides
(ATP and ADP), this interval is short, whereas for high concentra tion, the release of the
hydrolysis products is impeded and therefore some saturation for ∆tDtakes place. As a
result, one can assume that ∆ tD= ∆tst[ATP]/(CD+ [ATP]) with some constant CD>0
and ∆tstbeing the duration time of one step. At zero temperature, it follows from the over-
damped dynamics governed by Eq. (2) that ∆ tst→ ∞(an overdamped particle approaches
a potential minimum after an inﬁnitely long time). However, at nonzer o temperature, the
time for one step becomes ﬁnite, because in the vicinity of equilibrium, the particle is “cap-
tured” by thermal ﬂuctuations. Thus, in the limit a→0, the potential (1) is reduced to
the simple form U= 2(1−cosθ)/3, admitting an explicit solution of Eq. (2) for each step
ifξ(t)≡0. Since the average amplitude of thermal ﬂuctuations is/radicalBig
3D/2, one ﬁnds that
∆tst≃(3t0/2)ln/parenleftBig√
3cot/radicalBig
3D/8/parenrightBig
, wheret0= Γ/Wis the time unit and D=kBT/Wthe
dimensionless strength of white noise in Eq. (2). Since, at room temp eraturekBT≃4
pN·nm, we thus have D ≃0.05, so that ∆ tstcan be estimated for each viscous load Γ.
Averaging Eq. (4), one ﬁnds that /an}bracketle{tt+
j+1−t+
j/an}bracketri}ht= ∆tD+∆tTand therefore the rotational
rate ofγ(number of revolutions per second) is V= [3(∆tD+∆tT)]−1. Inserting here the
dependences of ∆ tD,Ton [ATP] given above, one ﬁnds
V=Vmax[ATP]
KM+[ATP]2/(CD+[ATP]), (5)
6
whereVmax= (3∆tst)−1= (∆tD)−1is a maximal average velocity (as [ATP] → ∞) and
the constant KM=AT/∆tstcan be identiﬁed as the Michaelis constant, because Eq. (5)
is reduced to the Michaelis-Menten law in the limit CD→0. According to Yasuda et al.
[16],KM= 0.8µM andVmax= 4 s−1, and for these values the dependence (5) is shown in
Fig. 5 (including the experimental data), with monotonic behavior fo rCD≤KM. Similarly
[16], one can assume that the one-step duration depends on the len gth of the ﬁlament Las
∆tst≃g0+g1L3, and substituting this expression into Eq. (5), one ﬁnds for small CDthe
dependence V(L)≃1
3(AT/[ATP]+ g0+g1L3)−1plotted in Fig. 6, where the constants AT
andg0,1are ﬁtted to the experiments [16].
As described above, for a given random hydrolysis sequence (4), e ach synthesis instant
t−
jis deﬁned as the time when the rotor, being at some time in state T, ro tates backwards
by 2π/3. Direct simulations of the dimensionless ( τ=t/t0) equation (2) with the potential
(1) are presented in Fig. 7. Here the intervals ∆ τD,T= ∆tD,T/t0in the sequence (4) are given
through the constants CDandKM, as well as the parameter ∆ τst= ∆tst/t0=W/3ΓVmaxto
be evaluated from experiments. Thus, using that Γ( L= 1µm)≃1 pN·nm·s andVmax= 4
s−1[16], one ﬁnds ∆ τst≃6.75.In the case without load (curves 1 and 2), the average
velocity/an}bracketle{tθ/an}bracketri}ht/2πτ= ΓV/Wis in good agreement with the direct observations (see Fig. 3 of
Ref. [16]) and the law plotted in Fig. 5 at CD=KM, where the two velocities shown with
dotted lines 1 and 2 correspond to curves 1 and 2 in Fig. 7, respectiv ely. Note that the
constant CDin Eq. (5) implicitly describes the main feature of trajectories at low [A TP] (see
curve 2): on average the number of multi-steps exceeds that of s teps backwards, as observed
experimentally [18,16]. Next, when a load torque Tl>0 is applied, the rotational rate
decreases with increase of this torque, as illustrated by curve 3 in F ig. 7. Moreover, when
the load exceeds some threshold value, the motor operates in inver se, as shown by curves 4
and 5. Similarly to Lattanzi and Maritan [8], the law (5) can be modiﬁed b y subtracting a
positive constant that controls the direction of rotation if Tl>0.
Thus, we have developed two (rotator and one-particle) physical models of archetypal
7
simplicity, which are consistent with the rotary binding-change mech anism [13,14] and the
elasticity properties of the γsubunit [15]. The cooperative rotational catalysis at the three
βsubunits is described through two time sequences, each for switch ing hydrolysis and syn-
thesis reactions, by adjusting the statistics of switching to satisf y the recent experimental
results [18,16]. The models described in this paper are generic and simp le; they do not
depend on details of the periodic potential U(θ). In the hydrolysis (motor) direction, the γ
subunit works in a “passive” regime; only all the βsubunits are coordinated in the cooper-
ative rotational catalysis. In the reversible (synthesis) direction ,γis “active”, causing the
corresponding (again cooperative, but in the inverse sequence) c onformational changes after
its strain energy of torsion reaches the free ATP hydrolysis energ y. These important fea-
tures are consistent with both Boyer’s binding-change mechanism [1 3,14] and the ﬁndings of
Cherepanov et al.and Junge et al.[15]. The dependences of the model parameters on ATP
concentration are general and physically motivated. In the frame work of our description,
the load torque Tl(θ,t) generated by the F 0part can further be involved explicitly resulting
in a general motor/pump model of ATP synthase.
We also conclude that the puzzle, how does the binding-change mech anism work, may
be essential not only for understanding the chemistry (dissipative catalysis) of creation of
ATP, one of the most important processes in life, but also constitut e a key physical problem
behind the function of molecular motors, such as design of man-mad e molecular devices.
