I. INTRODUCTION
Many physical ideas are ﬁnding applications in complex biological syste ms these days
[1,2]. Recently, we presented a theoretical scheme in which one can in vestigate the ratios
between the fractional population of blood groups [3]. This method h as some analogy with
the physical concept of renormalization andﬁxed points. Inthis pa per, we extend the theory
to investigate the problem of sex-linked inheritance.
In sex-linked inheritance, there are ﬁve population groups, XX,X′X,X′X′,XY, and
X′Y, whereX,X′andYrepresent the normal female, the defective female, and the male
chromosome, respectively. The group of so called carrier female is c haracterized by X′X.
Thegeneticruleisthatsonsreceive Yanddaughtersdo XorX′fromtheirfathers. Similarly,
their mothers deliver XorX′to sons and daughters. It is also known that there exist
mutations between XandX′. Another important factor in the present problem is that the
defective groups, X′X′andX′Y, have disadvantages in surviving and inheriting unlike in
the case of the blood groups [3]. This selection process should be tak en into account for any
reasonable discussions. Therefore, we consider the inheritance o f sex-linked disease in the
presence of mutation and selection and obtain the governing equat ions, which determine the
next fractional populations from the previous ones. The governin g equations will be used
to investigate the problems of genetic propagations of chromosom e-linked diseases such as
color blindness and hemophilia.
II. FRACTIONAL POPULATION EQUATIONS
We consider the ﬁve fractional populations with the following constr aints:
XX(n)+X′X(n)+X′X′(n) = 1 (1)
XY(n)+X′Y(n) = 1,
for then-th generation. The ratios of gene frequencies without mutation c an be determined
as
/tildewidestXf(n) =XX(n)+1
2X′X(n),
/tildewidestX′
f(n) =X′X′(n)+1
2X′X(n), (2)
/tildewidestXm(n) =XY(n),
/tildewidestX′m(n) =X′Y(n).
Although the mutation between the normal chromosome Xand the defective one X′
would be rare, still it plays an important role in the following discussion. In order to
consider the mutation, we introduce two probability factors, αandβfor the following
mutation processes;
Xα−→X′andXβ←−X′. (3)
Through the above mutation processes, the gene frequencies ar e modiﬁed as
2
Xf(n) = (1−α)/tildewiderXf(n)+β/tildewiderX′
f(n),
X′
f(n) = (1−β)/tildewiderX′
f(n)+α/tildewiderXf(n), (4)
Xm(n) = (1−α)/tildewiderXm(n)+β/tildewiderX′
m(n),
X′
m(n) = (1−β)/tildewiderX′
m(n)+α/tildewiderXm(n).
Thefractionalpopulationequations, whichgovernthepopulations ofthenextgeneration,
are now written as
/tildewidestXX(n+1) =Xf(n)×Xm(n),
/tildewidestX′X(n+1) =X′
f(n)×Xm(n)+Xf(n)×X′
m(n),
/tildewidestX′X′(n+1) =X′
f(n)×X′
m(n), (5)
/tildewidestXY(n+1) =Xf(n),
/tildewidestX′Y(n+1) =X′
f(n).
Since the defective chromosome causes a disease, the populations of/tildewidestX′X′and/tildewidestX′Ywill
have less chances of surviving and inheriting their genes. In order t o reﬂect this disad-
vantages, we introduce disadvantage factors δffor the female and δmfor the male groups,
respectively. Then, the populations of/tildewidestX′X′and/tildewidestX′Ywill be modiﬁed as
Pop[/tildewidestX′X′(n+1)]−→(1−δf)Pop[/tildewidestX′X′(n+1)], (6)
Pop[/tildewidestX′Y(n+1)]−→(1−δm)Pop[/tildewidestX′Y(n+1)].
With normalization, the fractional population equations are given by
XX(n+1) =Xf(n)·Xm(n)
1−δfX′
f(n)·X′
m(n),
X′X(n+1) =X′
f(n)·Xm(n)+Xf(n)·X′
m(n)
1−δfX′
f(n)·X′m(n),
X′X′(n+1) =(1−δf)X′
f(n)·X′
m(n)
1−δfX′
f(n)·X′m(n), (7)
XY(n+1) =Xf(n)
1−δmX′
f(n),
X′Y(n+1) =(1−δm)X′
f(n)
1−δmX′
f(n).
The above governing equations (1) ∼(7) yield the following constraint relations for any gen-
erationn,
Xf(n)+X′
f(n) = 1 and Xm(n)+X′
m(n) = 1. (8)
In order to understand the change of populations along generatio ns, it is convenient to
consider the automata equations for X′
fandX′
monly, which are given by
3
X′
m(n+1) =α+(1−α−β−δm(1−β))X′
f(n)
1−δmX′
f(n), (9)
2X′
f(n+1) =2α+(1−α−β)/parenleftBig

m(n)/parenrightBig
−2δf(1−β)X′
f(n)·X′
m(n)
1−δfX′
f(n)·X′m(n).
The above coupled recursion relations can now be used to study the ﬁxed points of X′
m
andX′
f, which correspond to the equilibrium values where X′
m(n+ 1) =X′
m(n) =X′
m∗
andX′
f(n+ 1) =X′
f(n) =X′
f∗. The ﬁxed points of X′
f∗are given by the solutions of the
algebraic equation,
a0+a1X′
f∗+a2(X′
f∗)2+a3(X′
f∗)3= 0, (10)
where the coeﬃcients aiare given by
a0=α(3−α−β),
a1= (α+β)(α+β−3)+δm(2β−α−β2−αβ−1)+2δfα(β−1), (11)
a2=δm(1+α+β)+2δf(2α+2β−β2−αβ−1)+2δmδf(β−1)2,
a3= 2δf(1−α−β)+2δmδf(β−1).
Solving this equation for stable ﬁxed points, we can readily determine the equilibrium pop-
ulation ratios.
We study the ﬁxed points in several cases. First of all, in the case of no mutation;
α= 0 and β= 0, the meaningful ﬁxed point, X′
f∗, is given by 0. It correctly predicts
that without mutations, the defective genes will disappear eventu ally. Secondly, when only
mutations are considered in the theory assuming δm= 0 andδf= 0, the ﬁxed point is given
byX′
f∗=α/(α+β). This result will be used in the discussion for color blindness. In othe r
general cases, the exact solution cannot be expressed in a closed form. However, since the
mutation rates are known to be very small( ∼10−5∼10−7), the ﬁxed point X′
f∗can be
expressed in terms of αandβin an approximate fashion and will be discussed in the next
section.
III. COLOR BLINDNESS AND HEMOPHILIA
The disadvantage, that a color blindness man or woman has, is not se vere enough to
reduce the chance of survival signiﬁcantly. Hence, we let the disad vantage factors be simply
zero in this case. Then, we easily notice from Eq. (9) that the ﬁxed p oint is given by
X′
m∗=X′
f∗=α
α+β. (12)
This result is identical to that obtained in the conventional genetics [4].
Using the fractional population equations of Eq. (7) and the above ﬁxed point, we obtain
the population ratios as
XY:X′Y=X∗
f:X′
f∗= 1−X′
f∗:X′
f∗=β:α, (13)
4
and furthermore
XX:X′X:X′X′=β2: 2βα:α2. (14)
The above result is the well known the Hardy-Weinberg law [5].
The demographic data for color blindness in England show that XY:X′Y= 12 : 1 [6].
Hence we conclude that β:α= 12 : 1. We notice that X′chromosome is more unstable
thanXchromosome since βis much larger than α. The abundance of carrier female is easily
noticed by the fact that XX:X′X:X′X′= 144 : 24 : 1.
Hemophilia is a dreadful disease which aﬀects the chance of survival and mating signiﬁ-
cantly. All of the female group X′X′perish completely upon birth. Hence, the disadvantage
factorδfis equal to 1. Then the ﬁxed point X′
f∗can be expressed up to the second order of
αandβas follows using Eq. (10) and (11),

A numerical calculation of the stable ﬁxed point, X′
f∗using Eq. (10) is shown in Fig. 1. We
ﬁnd thatthe dominant contributions comefrom αandδmasEq. (15)indicates. We also ﬁnd
that the values of the ﬁxed point X′
f∗are independent of initial values. The approximate
expressions, Eqs. (15) and (16) are found in good agreement with the exact expression Eq.
(10) except when δmis near zero.
It is useful to consider the male hemophilia population before selectio n in order to relate
the above formulation with the statistical data. Here, the relevan t demographic data is the
ratio,r, between the mutation cases and the all hemophilia cases;/tildewidestX′Y∗
mut=r·/tildewidestX′Y∗. Using
Eqs. (2)∼(7), the population of male infants with hemophilia before selection ca n be written
as
/tildewidestX′Y∗=1
2(1+α−β)X′X∗+αXX∗≡/tildewidestX′Y∗
inh+/tildewidestX′Y∗
mut. (17)
Here, the second term represents the male population having hemo philia caused by the
spontaneous gene mutation. Actually, the ﬁrst term also contains the gene mutation contri-
bution of1
2(α−β)X′X∗. However, when the demographic data rare collected, there is no
way to distinguish the inheritance from the mutation in this case, bec ause data collectors
simply check whether there were hemophiliac occurrences in the fam ily line or not. It is
straightforward to show that ris related to the disadvantage factor δmand the mutation
ratesαandβ. From Eqs. (2)∼(7), we ﬁnd
δm= 3r+(10−10r−2
r)α+(−3+5r)β+O(α2,αβ). (18)
The early statistical data for the infant male population having hemo philia [7] show that
/tildewidestXY:/tildewidestX′Y≃104: 1. Assuming that the current fractional population distribution h as
reached a ﬁxed point, we ﬁnd X′
f∗≃10−4from Eq. (5). Furthermore, a recent statistics
shows that the rate ris given by r≃1
3[8]. This data and Eq. (18) yield δm= 1−O(α,β).

This result is in a reasonable agreement with the fact that various th erapies treating male
hemophilia have beeninvented onlyrecently and, thus, theprobabilit yofsuccessful marriage
andreproductionwasalmostzeroformalepatient inthepast. With δm≃1andX′
f∗≃10−4,
we ﬁnd from Eq. (15) that the value of αis about 3 .3×10−5, which is in a reasonable range
as the probability of mutation. Also, we can obtain the population rat io of the carrier female
group using Eq. (7); XX:X′X:X′X′∼104: 1.33 : 0.
Since thelevel of therapies treating malehemophilia hasnow reached thestage that most
of male patient can marry and reproduce, it is interesting to study t he caseδm= 0 and make
predictionshowthemutationrateandthefractionalpopulationwill changeaccordingly. The
ﬁxed point of Eq. (15) and (16) will be modiﬁed as
X′
f∗=/radicalBigg

2α1
2+O(α,···), (19)
X′
m∗=α+(1−α+β)X′
f∗. (20)
Using the above results, we ﬁnd the modiﬁed rate
r=/radicalBigg
2
3α1
2+O(α,···). (21)
Assuming the mutation rate αdoes not change and remain α≃3.3×10−5as we ﬁnd in the
above, we can determine X′
f∗= 0.00707. Also, we readily obtain the fractional populations:
XX:X′X:X′X′= 98.6 : 1.41 : 0, and XY:X′Y= 993 : 7. The result clearly
shows that the majority of hemophilia would results frominheritance and that the fractional
population of carrier female increases drastically, when male hemoph iliac patients survive
and mate without any disadvantages. Therefore, nongenetic tre atment of hemophiliac male
may cause increase of hemophiliac population and infant deaths of fe male patients, unless
some concurrent measures are taken. However, we note that th e present calculation can not
produce the dynamic properties of the transition period between δm≃1 andδm≃0, since
δmis assumed static in the calculation.
IV. CONCLUSION
We have considered the population ratios of the genetic groups rela ted with chromosome
inherited diseases. The governing equations, which determine the r atios, are found in the
presence of mutation and selection. The selection is taken into acco unt in the formulation
by using the disadvantage factors. It is found that there exist ph ysical ﬁxed points in the
automata equations, which correspond to equilibrium population rat es. These fractional
population equations are used to discuss the cases of color blindnes s and hemophilia.
In the case of color blindness, there is no signiﬁcant disadvantage in selection so that the
disadvantage factors can be assumed zero. From the governing e quations, we readily obtain
the Hardy-Weinberg relation XX:X′X:X′X′=β2: 2αβ:α2. Using the statistical data
XY:X′Y= 12 : 1, we ﬁnd that the ratio of mutation rates α:β= 1 : 12.
Hemophilia seriously hampers chances of survival, mating and reprod uction. Especially
for female patients, chance of survival is almost zero, thus, makin gδf= 1. Using the
6
demographic data that one out of ten thousand male infants have h emophilia, and that one
third of all hemophiliac cases are thought to be caused by gene muta tion, we obtain the
following results; i) the disadvantage factor δmfor male is almost 1, ii) the mutation rate
α≃3.3×10−5, and iii) XX:X′X≃104: 1.33.
We have also studied the case when the hemophiliac male suﬀers no disa dvantage in the
selection process; δm= 0. It is found that the population of hemophiliac females and males
would increase drastically and inheritary hemophilia would be dominant o ver gene mutated
cases.
