Abstract
The statistical properties of an ecosystem composed of species in -
teracting via pairwise, random interactions and deterministic, conc en-
tration limiting self-interactions are studied analytically with tools of
equilibrium statistical mechanics of disordered systems. Emphasis is
given to the eﬀects of externally induced extinction of a ﬁxed fract ion
of species at the outset of the evolutionary process. The manner the
ecosystem copes with the initial extinction event depends on the de -
gree of competition among the species as well as on the strength of
that event. For instance, in the regime of high competition the ecos ys-
tem diversity, given by the fraction of surviving species, is practica lly
insensitive to the strength of the initial extinction provided it is not
too large, while in the less competitive regime the diversity decreases
linearlywith the size ofthe event. In the case oflargeextinction eve nts
we ﬁnd that no further biotic extinctions take place and, furtherm ore,
that rare species become very unlikely to be found in the ecosystem at
equilibrium. In addition, we show that the reciprocal of the Edwards -
Anderson order parameter yields a good measure of the diversity o f
the model ecosystem.

1 Introduction
Extinction seems to be the ﬁnal outcome of the evolution of species . In fact, as
species survive about 10 million years in the average, nearly all specie s that have
everexistedareextinct andonlyaverysmallfractionofthemhave left theirimpres-
sions in the fossil record [1, 2]. The causes of the mass extinction ev ents is currently
a matter of dispute as there are two main types of explanations [3]. T he more tra-
ditional one asserts that extinction is caused by external stress es as, for instance,
major climate changes and asteroids impacts. This point of view is sup ported by
some evidences such as the unusual quantity of iridium and other no ble metals in
the rocks that marked the boundary between the Cretaceous an d Tertiary periods,
when the era of the dinosaurs was replaced by the era of the mamma ls [4]. Since
iridium is more common in asteroids than in the Earth’s crust, this ﬁndin g can be
viewed as evidence for an asteroid impact. The alternative explanat ion asserts that
extinctions are caused by the interactions between the species in t he ecosystems.
In particular, Paine [5] has shown that species richness sometimes c an be increased
by the predator-mediated coexistence, and the removal of pred ators can lead to
additional species extinctions. Some recent studies indicate that f ood webs with
many species or high connectivity are more likely to lose species as a co nsequence
of the extinction of a single species when compared with more simple fo od webs
[6, 7]. Although this kind of argument seems well suited to explain the s o-called
background extinctions, it certainly needs some new ingredients to explain mass
extinctions as well. In fact, the missing ingredient seems to be the se lf-organized
criticality concept [8], which in this context is best illustrated by the po pular Bak-
Sneppen model [9]. According to this model, the ﬁtness of each spec ies is aﬀected
by the other species to which it is coupled in the ecosystem so that lar ge events
in the evolutionary history may be thought of as large coevolutionar y avalanches
caused by the intrinsic dynamics of the model. In this model, the distr ibution of
the extinction sizes follows a power law, which is a valid candidate for ﬁt ting to the
experimental data.
Although we recognize that evolution and hence extinction are, as p ictured by
the models mentioned above, essentially dynamical phenomena, in th is work we
study these phenomena within the equilibrium statistical mechanics f ramework of
the random replicator model for species coevolution [10, 11, 12, 13 ]. Deterministic
replicator models are commonly used to describe the evolution of self -reproducing
entities in a variety of ﬁelds such as game theory, prebiotic evolution and sociobiol-
ogy [14, 15]. The random replicator model introduced by Diederich an d Opper [10]
attempts to model the uncertainties and the overwhelming complex ity of the in-
terspecies interactions in biological ecosystems by assuming that t hose interactions
are random. However, it is also assumed that the dynamics is such th at a ﬁtness
functional (Lyapunov function) is maximized so that the only statio nary states are
ﬁxed points. In fact, the existence of such a functional leads to a replicator equa-
tion with symmetric interspecies interactions[15] which is a severeas sumption from
the biological standpoint. It allows, however, full use of tools of th e equilibrium
2
statistical mechanics to study analytically the averageproperties of the equilibrium
states of this kind of disordered ecosystems.
An interesting result of the random replicator model is that in the eq uilibrium
state a fraction of the species is extinct [10]. The mechanism of extin ction is clearly
outcompetition and, in the absence of any cooperation pressure, only the pair of
species with the largest reinforcing interactions will thrive. In this c ontribution we
study the eﬀects of random elimination of a ﬁxed fraction of the spe cies at the out-
set of the evolutionaryprocess, giving emphasis to the distribution of the remaining
species concentrations in the equilibrium state. There are several interesting issues
that can be addressed in this framework. For instance, what is the equilibrium situ-
ation when the fraction of species eliminated at the beginning is alread y largerthan
the fraction that would be extinct naturally due to outcompetition? Furthermore,
how does the ecosystem cope with large initial extinction events? In this paper we
give clear-cut analytic answers to these questions which are partly corroborated by
numerical simulations of the model ecosystem.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2 we intro duce the
model and discussthe ecologicalinterpretationofthe controlpa rameters. The equi-
librium properties ofthe model arederived within the replica-symmet ricframework
in Sec. 3 and the use of the reciprocal of the Edwards-Anderson o rder parameter
as a measure for the diversity of the ecosystem is suggested. In S ec. 4 we calculate
the distribution of probability of the concentrations of a given spec ies, allowing
thus the explicit calculation of the ecosystem diversity as the fract ion of surviving
species at equilibrium. Finally, in Sec. 5 we present some concluding rem arks.
2 Model
We consider an inﬁnite population (ecosystem) composed of individua ls belonging
toNdiﬀerent species whose ﬁtness Fi(i= 1,...,N) are the derivatives Fi=

i<jJijbixibjxj (1)
wherexi∈[0,∞) is the fraction of species iandbiis a quenched random variable
that takes the values 0 and 1 with probabilities aand 1−a, respectively. Hence Na
randomly chosen species are eliminated at the outset in the average and so hence-
forth we will refer to a∈[0,1] as the dilution parameter. An eﬀective competition
among the species is enforced by requiring that the concentration s of the surviving
species satisfy the constraint
N/summationdisplay
i=1bixi=Q0N, (2)
whereQ0is an arbitrary positive constant which gives the scale of the concen -
trations xi. The coupling strengths Jijbetween species iandjare statistically

so thatJij<0 corresponds to pairs of cooperating species while Jij>0 to pairs of
competing species. The self-interaction parameter u≥0 acts as a global coopera-
tion pressure limiting the growth of any single species, and it is crucial to guarantee
the existence of a nontrivial thermodynamic limit, N→ ∞. In fact, for large u
the minimum of Hcorresponds to a homogeneous ecosystem where the surviving
species have concentrations xi/Q0= 1/(1−a)∀i. The positive self-interactions
means that individuals of a same species compete against themselves , which is
quite reasonable as they certainly share the same resources (eco logical niche).
The time evolution of the species concentrations is given by the replic ator equa-

Hence the ﬁxed points of this equation are the minima of H(x) and in the following
we use the replica formalism to study analytically the statistical prop erties of these
minima.
3 The replica approach
Following the standard prescription of performing quenched avera ges on extensive
quantities only [16], we deﬁne the average free-energy density fas

to avoid divergences when carrying out the integrals over xi. Here/angbracketleft.../angbracketrightstands for
the average over the coupling strengths Jijas well as over the auxiliary variables

To proceed further we assume that the saddle-point parameters are symmetric
under permutations of the replica indices, i.e., pρ=p, ˆpρ= ˆp,qρδ=q, ˆqρδ=
ˆq,ˆRρ=ˆRandˆQρ=ˆQ. With this prescription the evaluation of Eq. (9) is
straightforward yielding the following replica-symmetric free energ y density

wherey=β(p−q)andDz=dzexp(−z2/2)/√
2πistheGaussianmeasure. Already
at this stage we can see that the concentration of species eliminate d at the outset,
given by the parameter Q, decouples from the other physical parameters and hence
does not have any eﬀect upon them. In the zero-temperature limit the saddle-point
equations ∂f/∂q= 0,∂f/∂y= 0 and ∂f/∂ˆR= 0 are given by
∆ = 2√q

We note that the parameter associated to the concentration of s urviving species
Q0appears only as a scale of qand so henceforth we will set Q0= 1 without loss
of generality. In the replica-symmetric framework the Edwards-A nderson order
parameter qis deﬁned by
q=/angbracketleftBigg

. (18)
If the concentrations xiwere normalized to 1 rather than to Nthenqwould give
the probability that two randomly selected individuals are of the same species, a
quantity known as Simpson’s index [17]. Nevertheless, we can still give a simple
physical interpretation to q. For instance, values of qof order of 1 indicate the
coexistence of a macroscopicnumber of species (i.e., xi≈1 for an extensive number
of species), while large values of qsignalize the dominance ofa few species only (i.e.,
xi≈Nfor a ﬁnite number of species). Of course, this interpretation is eq uivalent
to that given above for Simpson’s index, and so we can view 1 /qas a measure
of the diversity of the ecosystem. In Fig. 1 we present 1 /qas a function of the
dilution parameter afor several values of the cooperation pressure u. The results
of the numerical solution of the replicator equation, Eq. (4), for N= 500 are also
presented. Each data point is the average over 100 realizations of the matrix of
coupling strengths, starting with an uniform distribution of concen trations. Since
the labeling of the species is arbitrary we can set bi= 0 fori≤aNandbi= 1
otherwise, without loss of generality. In addition, we choose asuch that aNis
integer for simplicity. In agreement with our interpretation, for aclose to 1 we
can observe the vanishing of 1 /q, which characterizes an ecosystem composed of
a few species only. For small values of uthe analytical results show the existence
of a maximum of diversity for a nonzero value of the dilution paramete r (see the
inset in Fig. 1); the numerical results however do not corroborate this ﬁnding. This

discrepancy can be explained by the instability of the replica-symmet ric solution.
In fact, carrying out the standard local stability analysis [18], we ﬁn d that this
solution is locally stable wherever the condition

is satisﬁed. Figure 2 shows the regions in the plane ( a,u) where the replica-
symmetric solution is stable. In particular, we ﬁnd that for a= 0 this solution
is stable for u >1/√
2 while for a= 1 it is stable for u >1/2. Hence, the maxima
observed in Fig. 1 are indeed artifacts of the replica-symmetry fra mework. Nev-
ertheless, the agreement between the analytical and numerical r esults is already
excelent for u >0.6. The rather puzzling independence of the diversity on the
dilution parameter for small uhas a simple explanation as will be seen in the next
section.
4 Discussion
Although the interpretation of the reciprocal of the Edwards-An derson order pa-
rameter as the ecosystem diversity yields some information on the d istribution of
species at equilibrium, a better understanding is achieved by calculat ing explicitly

(20)
withW(x) given by Eq. (13). As all non-vanishing species concentrations ar e
equivalent we can write Pk(x) =P(x)∀k. Hence to evaluate Eq. (20) we introduce
the auxiliary energy

whereZauxis the partition function (6) with Hreplaced by Haux. Using Eq.
(22) the calculations needed to evaluate P(x) become analogous to those used in
the evaluation of the free-energy density (14). In addition, to ha ndle a possible
singularity in the limit β→ ∞it is more convenient to deal with the cumulative
distribution function C(x) =/integraltextx

the replica-symmetric framework we obtain

whereq,yand ∆ are given by the saddle-point equations (15)-(17). In Fig. 3 w e
showC(x) foru= 0.8 and several values of a. The ﬁrst point to note is that
limx→∞C(x) = 1−ayields the fraction of surviving species at the outset, as
expected. In addition, a nonzero value of C(0) indicates that the probability dis-
tribution P(x) has a delta peak at x= 0 and so C(0) actually yields the fraction
of the species that survived the initial externally induced extinction event but that
were extinct later on due to outcompetition. In the regime of large d ilution, say
a >0.8 in Fig. 3, the cumulative distribution is very small and practically cons tant
for small concentrations, indicating that no further extinctions h ave taken place
and, furthermore, that rare species are very unlikely to be found in the ecosystem
at equilibrium. We note that the numerical simulations yield results pra ctically in-
distinguishable from the analytical ones. The rough independence o f the diversity
1/qon the dilution parameter aobserved in Fig. 1 for small uis easily understood
with the aid of the cumulated distributions. In fact, a direct measur e of the ecosys-
tem diversity is given by the fraction of surviving species 1 −a− C(0), which is
shown in Fig. 4 as function of a. (We recall that ais the fraction of species that
were extinct at the outset due to some external stress and C(0) is the fraction that
died out due to outcompetition.) The remarkable similarity between th ese ﬁgures
corroborates our interpretation of 1 /qas a measure of the diversity. Clearly, the
diversity is insensitive to variations of awhenever the fraction of extinct species in
the undisturbed ecosystem (i.e. C(0) calculated at a= 0) is already considerably
largerthan a, sothat the species eliminated at the outset wouldprobablybe extin ct
later on anyway.
5 Conclusion
Although the dynamics of the random replicator model may not look v ery appeal-
ing, in the sense that it always leads to ﬁxed points, the frustration caused by the
competition between the concentration limiting self-interactions ( u >0) and the
tendency to unlimited growth of pairs of strongly cooperative ( Jij<0) species
results in a highly nontrivial equilibrium, characterized by many meta- stable states
[10] and a phase of replica symmetry breaking [11]. Of course, these very features
make some aspects of the dynamics (e.g., slow relaxation and hyster esis eﬀects)
nontrivial as well. The wealth of ecologically relevant issues that can b e addressed
within this equilibrium framework can be appreciated, for instance, in the case of
high-orderinteractionsamongthe species where it has been repor tedthe emergence
of a threshold value which gives a lower bound to the concentration o f the surviv-
ing species, preventing then the existence of rare (low concentra tion) species in the
ecosystem [13].
An important outcome of the equilibrium analysis of the random replica tor
model is the ﬁnding that in order to reduce the degree of frustrat ion a fraction
of the species dies out [10]. This type of extinction has clearly a biotic c ause,
namely, outcompetition [19]. In this paper we study how the model ec osystem

the replicator equation.
copes with abiotic or externally induced extinction, in which a fraction of randomly
chosen species is eliminated at the beginning of the coevolutionarypr ocess. We ﬁnd
that in the regime of high competition (small u) the ecosystem diversity, i.e., the
fraction of surviving species is practically insensitive to the strengt haof the initial
extinction provided it is not too large, while in the less competitive regim e (largeu)
the diversity decreases linearly with increasing a. In the case of a large extinction
event we ﬁnd that no further (biotic) extinctions take place and, f urthermore, that
rare species become very unlikely to be found in the ecosystem at eq uilibrium. This
is distinct from the result mentioned above for the case of high-ord er interactions
where the probability of ﬁnding rare species in the ecosystem is stric tly null [13].
An interesting by-product of our investigation is the ﬁnding that th e recipro-
cal of the Edwards-Anderson order parameter (i.e., the replica-s ymmetric overlap
between two equilibrium states) serves as an easy-to-calculate me asure of the di-
versity of the model ecosystem. This opens the exciting possibility o f interpreting
the diﬀerent hierarquical levels of the overlap order parameter in t he full replica
symmetry breaking scheme [16] as diﬀerent levels of a phylogenetic t ree that gives
the relations of dependence (viewed as ancestrality) among the sp ecies.
