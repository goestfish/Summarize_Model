INTRODUCTION\nThe evolution of the genetic material is determined by theinteractio ns among mutations,\nrandom drift and natural selection.\nThe mutation rate seems to vary both among and within genomes, be ing a\ufb00ected by\nmany factors, such as the chromosomal position (Sharp et al., 1989), the G+C content\n(Wolfe, 1991), the nearest neighbor bases (Blake et al., 1992), the di\ufb00erent e\ufb03ciency of the\nrepair systems between the lagging and the leading DNA strands dur ing replication and\n\u2217also INFN and INFM, sezione di Firenze, Largo E. Fermi, 2 I-50 125 Firenze, Italy\n1\ntranscription (Veaute & Fuchs, 1993). Thus the molecular clock se ems to tick at di\ufb00erent\nrate for di\ufb00erent DNA positions.\nThe natural selection acts as a driving force at virtually all levels of t he genetic in-\nformation processing and biological organization: from the DNA sta bility, replication and\ntranscription to messenger RNA life span and translation e\ufb03ciency, to the correct function-\ning of the gene products in the building up and propagation of a living or ganism. Although\nin principle all these constraints could interact in a very complex way, it is indeed fruitful\nto try to untangle the role of each element.\nWe have focused on the translation process as a major source of \ufb01 tness for the bacterial\ncell.\nBecause of the degeneracy of the genetic code and the historical process of codon capture\n(Osawa & Jukes, 1989), di\ufb00erent codons (synonymous codons) s pecify for the same amino\nacid. The bias in the codon usage is generally not random and it is very m arked in some\nprocaryotic and eucaryotic genes. The codon choice is specie-spe ci\ufb01c (Grantham et al.,\n1980), being roughly the same, although with di\ufb00erent intensities, in all the genes within a\ngenome. The codon bias is thought to be an e\ufb00ect of the improvemen t of the e\ufb03ciency of\nthe translation process under natural selection.\nSeveral authors have stressed that synonymous codons in E. coli, preferentially used in\nhighly expressed genes, are translated by the most abundant iso- acceptors tRNA species\nand that the levels of tRNAs in bacterial cells depend on the amino acid usage in proteins\n(Ikemura, 1981a).\nA good correlation between codon usage and tRNAs population has a lso been found in\nMycoplasma capricolum (Yamaoet al., 1991), in yeast (Ikemura, 1981b) (Ikemura, 1985)\nand in chloroplast genomes (Morton, 1993).\nThe importance of codon usage as a substrate for natural select ion is well proved by the\ncoding strategy of the coli phage T4: the early expressed genes of T4have a codon pattern\nclose to that of E. coliwhile the late expressed genes show a preference towards the cod ons\nread by the tRNAs expressed by the genome of the phage itself (Co we & Sharp, 1991).\nThe codon usage in\ufb02uences the elongation rate in the translation pr ocess, being the\npairing between codon and anticodon of the di\ufb00using tRNA the rate- limiting step compared\nwith the peptide bond formation and translocation steps (Gouy & Gr antham, 1980), but\nit cannot be directly related to the protein expression rate. In fac t many experiments have\ndemonstrated that other crucial steps a\ufb00ecting the protein pro duction rate are the selection\nof mRNA by a ribosome, the initiation phase and the phenomenon of po lypeptidyl-tRNA\ndrop o\ufb00 (Menninger, 1978).\nMoreover the dynamic of elongation phase seems to be more complex , depending also by\nthe di\ufb00erences in the energy of codon anticodon pairing (Grosjean & Fiers, 1982) (Thomas\net al., 1988); thus di\ufb00erences in elongation rates have been found for c odons read by the\nsame tRNA species (Sorensen & Pedersen, 1991).\nDi\ufb00erent considerations should be drawn on the evolutionary role of either the minor or\nthe major codons. Some authors have suggested that selection o f some of the rarer tRNA\nspecies may be the rate-limiting step in protein synthesis (Varenne et al., 1984): they hy-\npothesize that the rate of polypeptide elongation could act as a reg ulatory mechanism in\ngene expression when clusters of rare codons undergo translatio n, i.e. when the required\ntRNA concentration is low and rate-limiting. This hypothesis has been con\ufb01rmed exper-\n2\nimentally by manipulating the concentrations of some tRNAs and crea ting rate-limiting\nconditions. Varenne (Goldman, 1982) (Varenne et al., 1984) demonstrated experimentally\nthat the presence of rare codons in highly expressed coding region s is associated with pauses\nin the synthesis of proteins. Many di\ufb00erent contexts have been te sted with similar results:\nHoekema (Hoekema et al., 1987) replaced some major codons present in the \ufb01rst region of\nthePGK1gene ofSaccharomices cerevisiae with synonymous minor codons; Kinnaird (Kin-\nnairdet al., 1991) generated a cluster of three rare codons in the GDHgene inNeurospora\ncrassa. Chen and Inouye (Chen & Inouye, 1990) have demonstrated tha t the introduction\nof a cluster of a rare codon, AGG, in lacZsequence of E. coli, lowers the expression of the\ngene; moreover this e\ufb00ect is inversely correlated with the distance between the initiation site\nand the position of rare codons.\nModels that takes into account the in\ufb02uence of minor codons in the in itiation region of\nmRNA for protein production rate have been presented (Liljenstr om & von Heijne, 1987)\n(Liljenstrom & Bomberg, 1987).\nOn the contrary Sharp and Li (Sharp & Li, 1986) have hypothesize d that the pattern\nof synonymous codon usage in regulatory genes re\ufb02ects primarily t he relaxation of natural\nselection. In fact, the absence of rare codons from highly expres sed genes may well result\nfrom negative selection, while in low expressed genes, selection again st rare codons is very\nweak and so they can accumulate under the pressure of mutation.\nRemarkably di\ufb00erent considerations should be drawn for the major codons, i.e. codons\nread by the most abundant tRNAs. There is evidence that the majo r proteins are translated\nfaster than other proteins and that the elongation rate at major codons is faster than that\nat other codons (Emilsson & Kurland, 1990a).\nSome authors (Emilsson & Kurland, 1990a) (Emilsson & Kurland, 1990 b) have hypoth-\nesized that growth rate, in bacteria, depends on tRNA abundance . Such relation results in\nthe so called growth maximization strategy and it is consistent with a m ajor codon prefer-\nence strategy, in which an optimal subset of codons is thought to b e used very frequently in\nhighly expressed genes, and their cognate tRNA species are suppo sed to increase consider-\nably at high growth rates conditions. This is in agreement with the fac t that the genes for\nthe major tRNA species are located inside rRNA operons for a coord inate expression.\nThe growth rate dependence on tRNA abundances and other aspe cts of the evolution\nof genes and genomes in bacteria can be faced with statistical mech anics tools. Let us\nconsider an homogeneous population of bacterial genomes, subje cted only to synonymous\nmutations and natural selection. If we study its evolution in the pro ximity of a steady\ndynamical state, as for instance a balanced growth state, we can interpret the interaction\nbetween mutations and natural selection as a competition between randomness and order.\nIn this spirit we develop a statistical model from which bacterial evo lution emerges as an\noptimization process under environmental constraints.\nII. THE MODEL\nIn order to study quantitatively the competition between mutation and natural selection\nin naturally occurring sequences, we concentrate on the process of the elongation phase.\nWe suppose that the rate limiting step in this phase is the relative abun dance of charged\n3\ntRNAs. Thus we assume that thetime required by a ribosome to proc ess a codonisinversely\nproportional to the abundance of the charged cognate tRNAs in it s vicinity. Taking into\naccount the data from Gouy and Grantham (Gouy & Grantham, 198 0), the process of\ntRNA di\ufb00usion in cell extract results much faster than all others pr ocesses involved in our\nschematization, and thus we do not consider the e\ufb00ects of spatial gradients.\nFurthermore, we assume that the e\ufb03ciency of aminoacyl-tRNA syn thetases is not rate\nlimiting, i.e. that the concentration of the charged tRNAs does not v ary with the trans-\nlation process regardless of the codon composition of mRNAs. This a pproximation is not\ncompletely ful\ufb01lled in real bacteria. From the same source above (Go uy & Grantham, 1980)\nweobtainthatinaverageonly85%ofthetRNApoolisacylated, indica ting thatthereaction\nrate of synthetase is not substrate limited.\nIn this approximation we do not take into account the \ufb01nite size of a r ibosome, nor the\nqueuing of ribosomes, thus disregarding the positional e\ufb00ects of c odon usage, as considered\nelsewhere (Liljenstrom & Bomberg, 1987).\nWith this assumption, the translation time does not depend on the or der of codons in\nmRNA and can be calculated as the sum of the time required for each c odon. Finally, we\ndo not consider the in\ufb02uence of \ufb02uctuations, i.e. we develop a sort o f \u201cmean \ufb01eld\u201d model\nfor the translation.\nWe indicate the portion of mRNA that code for a protein (or, alterna tively, the whole\nmRNA) with a vector c;ci(i= 1,... ,61) being the number of codons of type iand\nL=/summationtext\nicithe length of the coding region. We denote with akthe relative abundance of\nacylated tRNA of type k(k= 1,... ,n tRNA;/summationtextntRNA\nk=1ak= 1). For E. colintRNA= 45, see\nalso the following section. The \u201ctranslational e\ufb03ciency\u201d of codons b y tRNAs is represented\nby means of a matrix Rikof size 61 \u00d7ntRNA. Again from (Gouy & Grantham, 1980), the\ntranspeptidation and translocation phases do not weight heavily on the tRNA cycle, and\ndisregarding them, the mean time required to translate the codon iis inversely proportional\nto\u03c1i=/summationtextntRNA\nk=1Rikak. The mean translation time per codon \u03c4(in arbitrary time units) is\nthus given by\n\u03c4(c) =1\nL61/summationdisplay\ni=1ci\n\u03c1i. (1)\nFor simplicity, the elements Rikcan be taken to be either 0, for a tRNA kthat does not\npair with a codon i, or 1, disregarding the di\ufb00erences in energies in the codon-anticod on\npairing discussed in the previous section.\nIn bacteria, cell division and DNA replication are coupled with cell grow th (Zyskind &\nSmith, 1992) (Ageno, 1992). In balanced growth conditions the av erage number of genomes,\nthe average number of cells and the cell mass increase exponentially with the same rate.\nThe cell growth largely depends on the production rate of the most abundant biopoly-\nmers, among which ribosomal proteins constitute the larger fract ion. The time \u03c4in formula\n(1), calculated for an \u201caverage\u201d ribosomal protein, can be consid ered proportional to the\nmean duplication time. We assume that the natural selection tends t o lower this time. A\nsomewhat opposite e\ufb00ect is due to the mutation process, that ten ds to randomize the codon\nsequence. Since silent mutations do not change the coded aminoacid and thus they do not\n4\na\ufb00ect the composition of proteins, they are neutral for the selec tion over the protein func-\ntionality. However, silent mutation are not neutral for the calculat ion of the duplication\ntime\u03c4, because of the presence of the abundance of cognate tRNAs in f ormula (1).\nLet us start from a simpli\ufb01ed situation, in which two synonymous codo ns (say codon\n0 and 1) are only read by two tRNAs (with respectively abundances a0anda1), while all\nother codons are grouped together (say codon 2) and in average are read by tRNAs with\nabundance a2(a0+a1+a2= 1). The number of synonymous codons is c0+c1=l. We\nconsider only mutations between 0 and 1 and vice versa. Since \u03c4does not depend on the\norder of the codons in the string, the various strains can be group ed together according with\nthe number jof one\u2019s in the mRNA ( j=c1). For each group jthere are gj=/parenleftbiggl\nj/parenrightbigg\nstrains.\nWe rewrite the formula (1) for the time \u03c4jrequired to duplicate a bacterium belonging\nto group jas\n\u03c4j=/parenleftbiggj\na1+l\u2212j\na0+L\u2212l\na2/parenrightbigg\n=rj+q+z;\nr=a0\u2212a1\na0a1;q=l\na0;z=Kl\na2;K=L\u2212l\nl.(2)\nThe quantity K\u22121is the relative abundance of the synonymous codons 0 and 1 in the\ncoding region. For l\u226aL,K\u2192 \u221e; forl\u2243L,K\u22430. Since selection only acts on 0 and 1\ncodons,K\u22121give an indication of the in\ufb02uence of selection on the gene.\nIn the unit time interval, the number of duplications \u03bdjof the mass Mjof bacteria\nbelonging to group jis\u03bdj=\u03c4\u22121\nj, and thus\ndMj\ndt=\u03bdjMj; (3)\nwhere for simplicity we set all constants to 1 and we neglect the time d ependence of Mj.\nIn the limit of very low mutation rate, we can assume that for each ge neration there is\nat most only one synonymous mutation, that changes codon 1 to 0 o r vice versa. Let us\nindicate with \u00b5/lthe rate of mutation per codon ( \u00b5\u22641). The average fraction of bacteria\nin group jthat undergo a mutation per unit of time is \u00b5\u03bdj. For bacteria in group j, a\nsynonymous mutation changes jof one unit. Including mutations, and working with the\nmassmj=Mj/gjof a single strain in group j, formula (3) becomes\ndmj\ndt= (1\u2212\u00b5)\u03bdjmj+j\nl\u00b5\u03bdj\u22121mj\u22121+l\u2212j\nl\u00b5\u03bdj+1mj+1; (4)\nfor 0\u2264j\u2264l, assuming that \u03bd\u22121=\u03bdl+1= 0.\nThe total mass of the bacterial population is M=/summationtextl\nk=0gkmk. We can derive from\neq. (4) the evolution equation for the distribution probability pj=mj/Mof di\ufb00erent\nstrains in the total population. In a natural environment the expo nential growth periods\nare sporadic, generally followed by starvation phases. We mimic this a lternation by means\nof the normalization of distribution, assuming that the strains corr esponding to a very low\nprobability are those eliminated by natural selection.\n5\nSince mutations do not change the total mass of population, we hav e, summing up over\njin eq. (4)\ndM\ndt=l/summationdisplay\nk=0gk\u03bdkmk=Ml/summationdisplay\nk=0gk\u03bdkpk=M\u00af\u03bd; (5)\nobtaining\ndpj\ndt=d\ndtmj\nM=1\nMdmj\ndt\u2212mj\nM2dM\ndt;\nand thus\ndpj\ndt= [(1\u2212\u00b5)\u03bdj\u2212\u00af\u03bd]pj+j\nl\u00b5\u03bdj\u22121pj\u22121+l\u2212j\nl\u00b5\u03bdj+1pj+1;\n\u00af\u03bd=l/summationdisplay\nk=0gk\u03bdkpk.(6)\nBefore dealing with these equations from a mathematical point of vie w, let us put some\nthermodynamical considerations. The scenario is reminiscent of st atistical mechanics sys-\ntems, in which there is competition between order (the energy func tion to be minimized,\nrelated to the average duplication time) and the entropy, mutuate d by the temperature.\nEach strain in group jcontributes with \u03c4jto the mean duplication time. Taking\ninto account the analogy between the duplication time of strains and the energy lev-\nels of a statistical system, in the equilibrium (stationary) state we c an tentatively apply\nthe methods from equilibrium statistical mechanics. The maximization of the \u201centropy\u201d\nS=\u2212/summationtextl\nk=0gkpklnpkunder the constraints/summationtextl\nk=0gkpk= 1(normalization of probability\ndistribution) and/summationtextl\nk=0gkpk\u03c4k=const(in order to select the most probable probability\ndistribution within those with the same \ufb01tness), gives the Boltzmann distribution (Landau\n& Lifshitz, 1958)\npj=Cexp(\u2212\u03b2\u03c4j).\nThe Lagrange multiplier \u03b2can be considered as the inverse of an e\ufb00ective \u201ctemperature\u201d\nT, that, intuitively, should be related to the mutation rate \u00b5. In the stationary state, \u00af \u03bdis\nconstant in time, and from eq. (5), M(and thus mj) grows exponentially.\nInserting the Ansatz\nmj=M0exp(\u03b1t\u2212\u03b2\u03c4j)\n(M0is the total mass at time t= 0) in the equation (4), and using the relations (2), we get\nfor the asymptotic state\n(1\u2212\u00b5)\u03bdj\u2212\u03b1+l\u2212j\nl\u00b5\u03bdj+1x+j\nl\u00b5\u03bdj\u221211\nx= 0, (7)\nwherex= exp(\u2212\u03b2r). Approximating \u03bdj+1\u2243\u03bdj\u22121\u2243\u03bdj, with an error of order r/\u03c42\nj, which is\nsmall for lorLlarge ora1\u2212a0small, eq. (7) becomes a linear equation in j. This equation\nholds independently of jif\nx=\u2212(1\u2212\u00b5)lr+/radicalbig\n(1\u2212\u00b5)2l2r2+4\u00b52q(q+lr)\n2\u00b5(q+lr),\n\u03b1=\u00b5(1\u2212x2)\nlrx.(8)\n6\nUsing the relations (2) we get\nx=(1\u2212\u00b5)(a1\u2212a0)+/radicalbig\n(1\u2212\u00b5)2(a1\u2212a0)2+4\u00b52a0a1(1+K\u02dca0)(1+K\u02dca1)\n2\u00b5a0(1+K\u02dca1)\nwhere \u02dcai=ai/a2,i= 0,1.\nNote that \u03b1= \u00af\u03bd. Numerical simulations of eq.(6) agree very well with this solution, an d\nshow that it is the only stable solution for almost all initial distributions .\nThe asymptotic form of Mj=gjmjforK= 0,l\u2192 \u221eand 1\u226aj\u226alis\nMj=M02l\u221a\n2\u221a\n\u03c0lexp/parenleftBigg\n\u03b1t\u2212(2j\u2212l)2\n2l\u2212\u03b2\u03c4j/parenrightBigg\n.\nIt is remarkable that although the distribution of pjis always a growing function of j(for\na1> a0), the distribution Mjis bell shaped, due to the contribution of the multiplicity\nfactorgj.\nThe most probable group jmaxcorresponding to the maximum of Mjis, using the Stirling\napproximation for gj,\njmax=lx\nx+1.\nForL\u226bl(K\u2192 \u221e),x= 1,T\u2192 \u221e,\u03b1= 0 and jmax=l/2. The distribution pjis\n\ufb02at because in this case the selection has no e\ufb00ect. This is due to the e\ufb00ective neutrality of\nmutations inside a group j.\nLet us consider in the following the opposite case L=l(K= 0), that represents a\nbacterium in which an essential protein is totally composed by the sing le aminoacid coded\nby 0 and 1 codons. This rather unrealistic case makes our model equ ivalent to a 1D kinetic\nIsing model (Kawasaki, 1972) in an external \ufb01eld without interactio ns among spins. In this\ncase we can analize in more details the in\ufb02uence of selection.\nWe can express \u03b1and\u03b2in term of \u03b5=a1\u2212a0:\nx=(1\u2212\u00b5)\u03b5+/radicalbig\n(1\u2212\u00b5)2\u03b52+\u00b52(1\u2212\u03b52)\n\u00b5(1\u2212\u03b5)\n\u03b1=\u00b5(x2\u22121)(1\u2212\u03b52)\n4\u03b5lx\n\u03b2=1\u2212\u03b52\n4\u03b5ln(x)\nwith 0\u2264\u03b5\u22641.\nFor\u03b5\u21920 (a1\u2243a0,r\u21920) we have T=\u03b2\u22121= 4\u00b5+O(\u03b52) and\u03b1= 1/2l. This\nrelationship con\ufb01rms the intuitive corrispondence between temper ature and mutation rate,\nat least for moderate di\ufb00erences in the tRNA abundances. For \u00b5\u21920, we get jmax=l,\ncorresponding to a distribution dominated by the \ufb01tter strains. In creasing the mutation rate\n\u00b5,jmaxdecreases; extrapolating to in\ufb01nite value of \u00b5(beyond the validity of our model), we\ngetjmax=l/2, and the in\ufb02uence of selection is vanished by mutations.\n7\nFor\u03b5\u21921 (a1\u226ba00,r\u2192 \u2212\u221e),T\u2192 \u221eand\u03b1= (1\u2212\u00b5)/l. In this limit only the \ufb01ttest\ngroupj=jmax=lsurvives. In this case all mutations are deleterious, and their e\ufb00ec t is to\nlower the growth rate \u03b1of the total mass of bacterial population.\nAt this stage of development, our model is too simpli\ufb01ed to allow quant itative com-\nparison with experimental data. However, it can be used as an inter pretative tool for the\nunderstanding of the mutation/selection dynamics.\nIII. PERTINENT DNA SEQUENCES ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION\nIn order to estimate the degree of optimization between codons an d tRNA species we\nhave analyzed 1530 Escherichia coli coding regions.\nThe choice of analyzing mainly the E. colicoding sequences depends not only on the\nlarge amount of data in literature and the large number of genes tha t have been sequenced\n(about 35% of the genome, at this date) but on the fact that in E. coligenome the e\ufb00ect of\na directional mutational pressure towards an increase in G+C or A+ T content is very little\n(about 51% G+C content), as compared with other organisms like Micrococcus luteus (74%\nG+C content) or Mycoplasma capricolum (25 % G+C content) (Sueoka, 1993) (Osawa &\nJukes, 1988b). This pressure, probably due to mutations in the DN A polymerase system,\nacts particularly in shrinking the codon and anticodon sets: in E. colithere are 75 tRNA\ngenes, and 45 types of anticodons, while in Micrococcus luteus orMycoplasma capricolum\nthese numbers are much lower (29 and 33 tRNA genes, resp.). Besid es, the large e\ufb00ects of\nthe directional mutational pressure on genomes composition prob ably results in weakening\nother existing functional constraints.\nFor each gene we have considered the simple relationship (1) betwee n codons at position\ni, (ci)andtRNAmoleculeabundances( \u03c1i). Wehaveconsideredequaltranslationale\ufb03ciency\nfor all codons.\nThe e\ufb00ective tRNA species abundances at di\ufb00erent duplication rate s are not exactly\nknown; little di\ufb00erences in the total tRNA abundances have been pr oved experimentally\namong di\ufb00erent strains of E. coli(Jakubowski, 1984), but the relative abundances do not\nseem to vary largely even among di\ufb00erent species of enterobacter ia: the data by Ikemura\nshow that there is a good correspondence between the relative ab undances of the tRNA\nspecies between E. coliandSalmonella typhimurium . Thus we have approached the problem\nperforming the calculations in two ways:\na) considering the data on the relative abundances of the tRNA spe cies published\nby Ikemura ( \u03c4I) (Ikemura, 1981a) (Ikemura, 1981b) (Ikemura, 1985) and Jak ubowski\n(Jakubowski,1984).\nb) using the data on tRNA gene dosage published by Komine ( \u03c4K) (Komine et al., 1990).\nBoth these two implementations are a\ufb00ected by di\ufb00erent approxima tions.\nIn case (a) the data determined by Ikemura are not exhaustive. W e have approximated\nthe abundances of the minor tRNAs at the value 0.1 with respect to t he abundance of Leu-\ntRNA normalized at 1. In case (b) we have considered the abundanc e of tRNA species to\nbe just proportional to the number of tRNA genes; this assumptio n could be not completely\ntrue because di\ufb00erent tRNA gene clusters are regulated by di\ufb00ere nt promoters and because\nof di\ufb00erences in aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases abundances and cat alytic activities.\n8\nIn Fig. 1 we report the average time spent per codon \u03c4Ifor 1530 coding sequences, both\nfor the correct reading frame and for the +1 and +2 reading frame s. The sequences are\nordered according with the value of \u03c4Iof the correct reading frame.\nIn Fig. 2 we report \u03c4Kfor the same sequences of Fig. 1.\nThe comparison of the two \ufb01gures shows that there is a good agree ment between the\nvalues of \u03c4Iand\u03c4K, although the data obtained using the distribution of tRNA abundan ces\nfrom Ikemura show a more marked separation between the correc t reading frame and the\n+1 and +2 frames. This indicates that there is a good corresponden ce between tRNA\nabundances and number of copy of the related tRNA gene, i.e. the m ost abundant tRNAs\nare expressed by triplicated or quadruplicated genes while the less a bundant tRNA species\nare expressed by genes present in a single copy.\nIn all the analyzed coding regions, the correct reading frame alway s presents the lower\ncrossing times, although the di\ufb00erences are more marked for the h ighly expressed sets: the\nmean translation time of the correct reading frame for highly expre ssed coding regions (as\nribosomal genes, see Fig. 1) is lower than those calculated for non h ighly expressed coding\nregions, while the value for the +1 and +2 frames are equal or somet imes greater.\nWe have also compared our results with the Sharp and Li\u2019s Codon Adap tation Index\n(CAI) of each sequence. This index does not depend directly on the abun dances of tRNA\nbut it is a measure of the bias in codon usage (Sharp & Li, 1987) de\ufb01ne d as follows\nCAI=/parenleftBiggl/productdisplay\nk=1wk/parenrightBigg1\nl\n;CAI\u2208(0,1) (9)\nwhere the product of wk=w(ik) is taken over the code under examination. The quantities\nw(ik) for a codon iat position kis given by the relative frequency of the codon iwith\nrespect to the most used codon for the same aminoacyd in a set of h ighly expressed genes.\nNote that in principle is possible to sinthetize arti\ufb01cial sequences mad e only of major codons\nwith aCAIvalue greater than that of the most abundant proteins. This occo urs because\nthis index neglect the in\ufb02uence of mutations. The same misundersta nding occours with our\nquantity \u03c4.\nIn Fig. 3 we report the CAIvalues for the same sequences of Fig. 1. The agreement\nwith both the \u03c4Iand\u03c4Kis rather good.\nThegenesthatshowahighlybiasedcodonusagehavehighvaluesof CAI(andlowvalues\nof\u03c4I) and belong to the translationand transcription machinery, asfor instance genes coding\nfor ribosomal proteins, initiation and elongation factors, heat sho ck or stringent response\nproteins, genes involved in the core of intermediate metabolism and g enes coding for the\nmost abundant membrane proteins.\nGenerally the genes whose products are proved to be required for maximal growth rate\nshow high value of CAI. We can consider for instance the118IF2\u03b1and71IF2\u03b2(Sacerdot\net al., 1992) that operate in the initiation of the translation process and probably a\ufb00ect\nthe production of ribosomal RNA, and the product of the nusAgene that is involved in\nthe transcriptional process. These three genes are clustered in the same operon, probably\nfor a co-regulation of translation and transcription. The apices ind icate the position of the\nsequences in the \ufb01gures.\n9\nThe DNA polymerases I and II are present in di\ufb00erent concentratio ns; about 400\nmolecules of polymerase I per cell with respect to 17-100 molecules p er cell of polymerase\nII (Adams et al., 1992). The CAIvalues of the two genes (334polAand760polB) re\ufb02ect the\ndi\ufb00erence: 0.403 ( \u03c4I= 2.29) versus 0.352 ( \u03c4I= 2.89).\nSince biosynthetic operons are quite constitutively expressed, ex cept during starvation\nconditions, the genes coding for the repressor proteins show CAIvalues lower than repressor\ngenes in catabolic operons.\nIn some cases genes coding for functional aggregates constitut ed by structural proteins\ninteracting in a precise stoichiometry ratio show values of CAIor\u03c4Iclose to this ratio. This\nrelation is true only for highly expressed genes; for example some rib osomal proteins, as1L7\nand11L20, arepresent asa tetramer ineach ribosome(Adams et al., 1992): the CAIvalueof\nthe correspondent genes are higher than those of other ribosom al genes; the same correlation\nhasbeenfoundforATP synthetases genes that codeforalargec omplex constituted bymany\ncopies of di\ufb00erent subunits: there is a good agreement between th eCAIvalues of the genes\nand the stoichiometry of the subunits in the complex. This correspo ndence almost vanishes\nfor structural proteins coded by low expressed genes as those c oding for \ufb01mbriae, pili and\n\ufb02agella.\nGenerally, the enzymes that channel a metabolic pathway do not pr esent the same bias\nin codon usage, probably because natural selection acts primary o n the homogenization of\nthe catalytic activity of the metabolon, however there are also few interesting clues of the\ncontrary.\nThe membrane lipids biosynthesis in E. coliinvolves the action of at least 25 genes;\nmany of these are clustered in the faboperon. Although the regulation of this pathway is\nvery complex and not yet completely elucidated, with regard to both the total fatty acid\ncontent and the phospholipids composition, there are some observ ations that indicate that\nthe activities of few enzymes (acetyl-CoA:ACP transacetylase, ac etyl CoA carboxylase) are\nrate limiting in vivo (Magnuson et al., 1993). We have found that the bias in codon usage\nof these genes is higher than that of the genes coding for the othe r enzymes of the pathway.\nSince growth rate depends also by membrane lipids production, the b ias in the bottleneck\nof the pathway probably increases the rate of production, while its e\ufb00ect on the other genes\nis vanishingly small.\nOther interesting examples regard the relatively high bias in codon us age in genes like\n24spoT,180htpr,280uspA,295\ufb01s,130cspAand175ackA.\nSincespoTencodes for a ppGpp pyrophosphohydrolase, it takes into accoun t for the\ndegradationofppGpp, themajorinductorofthestringent respo nse, thataccumulatesduring\nstarvation periods.\nNutritionalshift-upexperiments, inwhichlargeamountofnutrient sareaddedtobacteria\ngrowing in a minimal medium, have revealed that there are immediate ch anges in the rate\nof increase of cell mass while the cell division rate continues for some time at pre-shift rate\n(Cooper, 1991).\nThus the competition among bacteria requires to exit quickly fromth e starvation periods\nand to restart growing when conditions have changed; in this sight t hespoTgene (CAI=\n0.59,\u03c4I=1.4 ) could be a very important target for natural selection. Prob ably for the same\nreason the htprgene (CAI= 0.553, \u03c4I= 1.95) has a relatively highly biased codon usage:\nthe encoded protein coordinates the global response of the cell t o heat shock events. In fact\n10\nthis gene codes for a sigma-32 subunit that substitutes the sigma- 70 in the core of RNA\npolymerase making the new holoenzyme capable of activating the hea t shock promoters.\nHenceforth other heat shock genes show a biased codon usage as for instance485dnaJand\n462groEL. The intracellular amount of the universal stress protein, coded b y the gene uspA\n(CAI= 0.52,\u03c4I= 2.19), greatly increases in the cases of exhaustion of nutrients lik e carbon,\nnitrogen, phosphate, sulfate or aminoacid (Nystrom & Neidhardt, 1992).\nWe hypothesize that codon usage re\ufb02ects not only the e\ufb00ects of s election for high growth\nrate conditions but also selection for very fast, and perhaps shor t time lasting, response to\nequally rapid environment changes. A clue that agrees well with this h ypothesis concerns\nthe\ufb01sgene (CAI= 0.53,\u03c4I= 2.21) whose product functions as a DNA binding protein,\ninvolved in recombination reactions and in rRNA transcription. It has been reported that\nwhen the availability of a rich medium allows the bacterial cells to exit fro m the stationary\nphase, the amount of the \ufb01sgene product increases from less than 100 copies to over 50000\ncopiesbeforethe\ufb01rst cell division. Astheexponential growthgoe son, theFislevels decrease\nconsiderably (Ball et al., 1992). The gene cspA(CAI= 0.808, \u03c4I= 1.81) codes for the major\ncold shock gene (CS7.4) (Tanabe et al., 1992); when the temperature shifts from 37\u25e6Cto\n10\u25e6Cthe level of the protein largely increases and becomes about 13% of the total proteins\nin the bacterial cell.\nIt is noteworthy that since acetyl phosphate seems to be a global regulator of signal\ntransduction in E. coli, also the gene ackA(CAI= 0.66,\u03c4I= 1.9) that codes for a protein\nthat synthesizes acetyl phosphate from ATP and acetate prese nts a high value of CAI.\nThere are genes with little if any di\ufb00erences in values of \u03c4Ibetween the correct reading\nframe and the others. This is mostly true for genes in plasmids (see F ig. 1). Since plasmids\nand conjugative transposons play a key role in the interchange of d rug resistance and viru-\nlence traits among bacteria, and generally in the mobilization of the ge netic material, it has\nbeen proposed that the entire pool of genetic information could be accessible to all members\nof the bacterial community, considered as a single, heterogeneou s organism. In this regard\nthe emergence of a bias in codon usage for a gene carried by a plasmid is treated unfairly by\nnatural selection if the rate of the genetic information interchang e among conjugative bac-\nteria of di\ufb00erent species is su\ufb03ciently high. In fact because of the g enetic \ufb02ux, the plasmid\ncould visit a wide range of hosts, thus it could assay di\ufb00erent molecula r environments and\ntherefore the recombinant processes between homologous gene s maintain sequence homo-\ngeneity. Furthermore, an increased expression of a gene could be attained also by increasing\nthe number of copies of the plasmids .\nThe debate between neutralists and selectionists in evolutionary an d population genetics\naddresses the question of how the superposition and the interact ions between the di\ufb00erent\nconstraints acting on the coding regions allow the tremendous amou nt of molecular genetic\nvariation that natural bacteria populations exhibit.\nThe comparison of the standard deviation of the CAIindex for thirteen sequences of D-\nglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenasegene(33gapgene; average CAI=0.830,standard\ndeviation 0.0025) from di\ufb00erent strains of E. colisequenced by Selander ( Selander et al.,\n1991) and ten sequences of the alkaline phosphatase gene (843phoAgene,CAI= 0.344,\nstandard deviation 0.0059) sequenced by Milkman (DuBose & Hartl, 1 991), shows that\ngenes with higher bias in codon usage present lower levels of silent poly morphism.\nThis relation suggests that the more biased the codon usage of a ge ne among a bacteria\n11\npopulation, the less neutral the synonymous mutation.\nAnother fundamental question regards if and in what measure the bias in codon usage\nparticipates in the control of gene expression. E. coliand bacteria in general are governed by\nrobust and plastic regulative mechanisms and even if regulative circu itry are parsimonious\nin design, the present day gene networks have a large tool-kit of re gulative mechanisms,\nboth at the gene-protein and at the protein-protein interaction le vel.\nAlthough the basic mechanisms act at the operonlevel, there are glo bal mechanisms that\nallowthecelltorespondtochallenges, ashunger orstress situatio ns, withthecoordinateand\nconcerted expression of a network of operons. These mechanism s rely mainly in a cascade-\nlike activation of autogenously regulated stimulons or in the sigma sub unit variability that\nmakes the polymerases capable of recognizing di\ufb00erent types of pr omoters.\nWithin the operon there are mechanisms that di\ufb00erentiate the expr ession at the single\ngene level, as for instance internal promoters, transcription ter mination signals, ribosome\nbinding sites with di\ufb00erent e\ufb03ciency, mRNA degradation signals etc.\nAlthough bias in codon usage has been proved to play a role in di\ufb00erent iating the ex-\npression levels of the genes within the operon, since these mechanis ms act sequentially, the\ne\ufb00ect of codon bias on the translation process probably depends la rgely on the optimization\nof the other factors involved in the gene expression.\nThe amounts of the genes that present high values of CAI, for instance the ribosomal\nand major outer membrane genes whose products are strongly re quired with respect to\nother proteins for high duplication rates, are the e\ufb00ective \ufb01tness bottleneck of the bacterial\nduplication machinery; thus the growth maximization strategy allows a cell to duplicate\nfaster because it lowers the time needed for translation.\nThe natural selection acts so much stronger in optimizing the trans lation of the very\nhighly expressed genes, with respect the other genes, because f urther increases in the trans-\nlation e\ufb03ciency of these latter genes re\ufb02ects smaller improvements in the \ufb01tness of the cell.\nConsiderations of this type have also been proposed and tested by Dykhuizen and col-\nlaborators for lacoperon in E. coli(Deanet al., 1986); they have demonstrated that the\ncontribution to the \ufb01tness of the proteins encoded by the lacoperon is quite di\ufb00erent, being\nthe bottleneck of the lactose metabolic pathway the \ufb02ux of lactose into the cell, governed by\nthe concentration of the enzyme lac permease: thus the increase of catalytic activity of the\nother enzymes coded by the lac operon (for example beta-galacto sidase) results in a very\nlittle increase of the global \ufb01tness of the pathway.\nThis could be a general principle in gene network architecture, i.e. th e potentiality of\nincreasing the global\ufb01tness ofthe pathway could not beequally dist ributed among thegenes\nbelonging to a gene network.\nBeing generally accepted that the weaker the selective constraint , the wider the random\ngenetic drift (Li & Graur, 1991), the more relaxed situation of gen es whose product are not\nrequired in large amount, allows high genetic variability consisting mainly in synonymous\nsubstitutions.\n12\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\nWe have modeled some aspects of the molecular evolution of bacteria genomes by means\nof the coupling between codon distributions and tRNAs abundance a nd the competitive\ne\ufb00ects of mutation and selection. Our model is consistent with a the rmodynamical inter-\npretation of this process, and gives a matematical support to the observed codon usage\ndistribution.\nThe evolution of a non synchronized population of bacteria is schema tically drawn as\nalternated phases of exponential growth (feast) and selection ( famine), due either to star-\nvation or to external reasons. In bacteria, because of the limiting amounts of nutrients\nand the rapid \ufb02uctuation in their availability in natural environment, t he periods of growth\nare sporadic. Indeed, during these sporadic periods, the number of bacterial cells tends to\nincrease exponentially and the competition between genotypes cou ld develop very hardly,\nbecause a light di\ufb00erence in the \ufb01tness could result in a large di\ufb00erenc e in number and in\nthe a\ufb03rmation of the \ufb01tter genotype.\nProbably the two extreme conditions of feast and famine model larg e part of the \ufb01tness\nfunction of the bacterial genomes.\nBias in codon usage seems to be an adaptive response not only to fea st periods but also\nto conditions of changing surroundings. In fact to survive famine p eriods would require\nsophisticated regulative mechanisms leading to a shrewd managemen t of the resources as for\ninstancethestringentresponse, whiletheselectionforrapidoscilla tingperiodsmakethecells\nmaximize the sharp up-shift or down-shift production of some spec i\ufb01c proteins. According\nto this hypothesis, bias in codon usage has revealed an interesting t ool to investigate the\n\ufb01tness bottleneck in metabolic pathways or in gene networks like str ingent response.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Fiammetta Battaglia, Marcello Buiatti and Stefano Ru\ufb00o fo r helpful discus-\nsions.\n13\nV.

Ong1\n1Department of Physics, and2Department of Molecular Biology,\nPrinceton University, Princeton, New Jersey 08544\n(Dated: October 26, 2018)\nWe have investigated the electrical conductivity of \u03bb-DNA using DNA covalently bonded to Au\nelectrodes. Thiol-modi\ufb01ed dTTP was incorporated into the \u2018 sticky\u2019 ends of bacteriophage \u03bb-DNA\nusing DNA polymerase. Two-probe measurements on such molec ules provide a hard lower bound\nfor the resistivity \u03c1 >106\u2126cm at bias potentials up to 20 volts, in con\ufb02ict with recent c laims of\nmoderate to high conductivity. By direct imaging, we show th at the molecules are present after the\nmeasurements. We stress the importance of eliminating salt residues in these measurements.\nThe question whether DNA is electrically conducting\nhas generated broadinterest. The initial spurt of interest\narose in photoexcitation experiments which were inter-\npreted in terms of long-range electron transfer [1]. In the\npast few years, there have been upwards of 20 papers re-\nportingtheresultsofmoredirectelectricalmeasurements\nranging from contactless meaurements at microwave fre-\nquencies to DC measurements. A distressingly wide\nrange of conductivity values \u2013 from \u03c1 <10\u22124\u2126cm\nto\u03c1 >106\u2126cm \u2013 has been reported [2, 3, 4, 5, 6].\nProximity-induced superconductivity in DNA has also\nbeen claimed [7]. Recently, local polarization measure-\nments by \u2018electrostatic force microscopy\u2019 have been used\nto show that \u03bb-DNA is insulating [8, 9]. We note, how-\never, that the force-microscopy experiments probe con-\nductivity at relatively weak bias potentials.\nIn many of the DC measurements, contact with the\nmetal electrodes (usually Au) was achieved by laying\ndown the molecules directly on the electrodes. Although\nexpedient, this approach raises several concerns. It is\nvery di\ufb03cult to prove that the DNA molecule is in direct\nphysical contact with the electrodes. Even if contact is\nattained, the weak physical adhesion between DNA and\nAu may produce an insulating contact and possibly ac-\ncount for the wide variation in reported resistivities [10].\nA recentexperiment on octanedithiol [11] has shownthat\ndeliberate chemical bonding between organic molecules\nand metal electrodes is a pre-requisite for achieving re-\nproducible conductivity results. Thus a better approach\nwould be to achieve direct chemical binding between the\nopenendsof \u03bb-DNAandAu. Thebondsshouldbestrong\nenough to withstand shear forces in a \ufb02ow, and should\nsurvive the measurement process. A second concern is\nthe shunting e\ufb00ect of bu\ufb00er residue. Because of its \ufb01nite\nconductance, the bu\ufb00er salts which coat the electrodes\nand substrate produce a spurious conductance signal.\nHence adequate salt removal is important. We report\nthe results of experiments performed along these lines.\nOur results show that \u03bb-DNA is a good insulator up to\nbias potentials of 20 volts.\nChemical binding between organicmoleculesand Au is\nusuallyachievedbytheAu-thiol(SH) chemicalbond[12].\nCommercially available oligonucleotides modi\ufb01ed to in-corporatethethiolgroupusuallyhavecarbon-chainspac-\ners (C3 or C6) between the thiol group and DNA [3, 6,\n13], which may present barriers to electron transfer. To\navoid the spacer problem, we adopted an approach in\nwhich the DNA base-pair is bound directlyto gold elec-\ntrodes by a Au-thiol bond. This approachshould provide\nthe most direct conductance channel between the gold\nelectrode and the putative electronic \u201c \u03c0-way\u201d proposed\nfor the DNA helix [14].\n\u03bb-DNA is a double-stranded DNA helix comprised of\n48,502 base pairs (length \u223c16\u00b5m). At the extremities,\nthere are single-stranded 12-base 5\u2019 overhangs (\u2018sticky\nends\u2019), with the complementary sequences\n5\u2032\u2212GGG CGG CGA CCT ,5\u2032\u2212AGG TCG CCG CCC ,\nwhere A,C,G,T are the nucleotides adenine, cytosine,\nguanine and thymine, respectively. Our technique re-\nlies on the incorporation of T\u2019s modi\ufb01ed to include the\ndesired thiol group [15, 16]. The \u2018sticky\u2019 ends are \ufb01lled\nin by a standard reaction [17] using the Klenow frag-\nment of DNA polymerase and the three deoxynucleoside\ntriphosphates dATP, dGTP, and S4-dTTP (see Fig. 1-\nA). Because of the preponderance of modi\ufb01ed dTTPs\n(and absence of dCTP) in solution, we can incorporate a\nsigni\ufb01cant number of modi\ufb01ed T\u2019s at both ends of each\nDNA molecule [18]. To prevent the Klenow fragment\nfrom excising T\u2019s that are not Watson-Crick matched to\nthe template, we use a mutated form of the Klenow frag-\nment which lacks the 3\u2019 \u21925\u2019 proof-reading activity [19].\nWe tested the incorporation of the nucleotides into the\nDNA ends by a ligation assay [20]. Unmodi\ufb01ed \u03bb-DNA\nis readily ligated by T4 DNA ligase to form multimers.\nIn the modi\ufb01ed \u03bb-DNA, however, the sticky ends \u2013 now\n\ufb01lled in by the incorporated bases \u2013 are blunt, and multi-\nmerformationis stronglysuppressed. Thereactionprod-\nucts were analyzed by pulsed-\ufb01eld gel electrophoresis. As\nshown in Fig. 1-B, unmodi\ufb01ed \u03bb-DNA (\u201cnatural- \u03bb\u201d) was\ne\ufb03ciently ligated (lane 3). To control for the possibility\nthat unincorporated S4-dTTP inhibited ligation, \u03bb-DNA\nmonomers were ligated in the presence of all 3 dNTP\u2019s\nminus the polymerase(\u201ccontrol- \u03bb\u201d), and the ligation was\nalso e\ufb03cient (lane 6). The majority of the thiol-modi\ufb01ed\n\u03bb-DNA (\u201cHS- \u03bb\u201d), however, remained as monomers (lane\n2\n5). This provides strong evidence that the protocol is\ne\ufb00ective in incorporating bases into the ends of \u03bb-DNA.\n1    2     3    4     5     6(A)\n(B)5' 3'3' 5'G A\nC T\nS -T4\n\u03bb\n\nDNABind directly\n\nonto Au5' 3'5'\n\u03bb\n\nDNAKlenow\nFIG. 1: (A) The schematic of the incorporation of deoxynu-\ncleoside triphosphates into \u03bb-DNA \u2018sticky\u2019 ends using the\nKlenow fragment (3\u2019 \u21925\u2019 exo\u2212); (B) Pulsed-\ufb01eld gel (PFG)\nelectrophoresis of thiol-modi\ufb01ed and natural \u03bb-DNA before\nand after ligation [21].

The\nAu surfaces were rigorously cleaned [22] before deposit-\ning the modi\ufb01ed DNA. At several stages during these\nexperiments, it was important to observe the molecules\nin an optical microscope. To image the thiol-modi\ufb01ed\nDNA molecules, we stained them with the \ufb02uorescent\nintercalating dye TOTO1 (Molecular Probes), and then\nloaded them on the chip. After a 20-min. incubation pe-\nriod, many of the molecules were observedto be attachedto the electrodes at one end. The unattached molecules\nwere carefully rinsed in 1 \u00d7TE [23]. The chip was then\ncovered with a clean coverslip, and a \ufb02ow of the bu\ufb00er\nsolution was applied perpendicular to the electrodes. We\nobserved that DNA molecules anchored at one end were\nstretched by the bu\ufb00er \ufb02ow to bridge the space between\nthe electrodes. Many of these molecules subsequently\nattached to the second electrode by their free end. Af-\nter this occurs, the \ufb02ow may be repeatedly reversed to\ndemonstrate that the anchored DNA molecules bow out\nwith the \ufb02ow while their ends remain anchored (Panels\nA and B of Fig. 2. See video in Ref. [24]). This is di-\nrect evidence that chemical binding between the ends to\nAu is much stronger than physical adhesion of the rest\nof the molecule to either quartz or Au. (For the speci\ufb01c\nDNA samples used in the resistivity measurements, we\ncarried out the dye-staining step afterthe measurements\nto avoid inadvertent damage from dye intercalation.)\n10\u00b5m\nAA\nBBA-1 A-2\nB-1 B-2 C\nFIG. 2: Images of HS- \u03bbDNA on quartz chips with\nAu electrodes.

Panel C: Many HS- \u03bbDNA\nmolecules spanning two electrodes. The image was taken af-\nter the Mg2+and NH 4Ac rinsing. Scale bar applies to all\npanels [24].\nAs discussed above, a crucial step in the experiment\nwastheremovalofbu\ufb00er. Inpreliminaryexperiments,we\nrepeatedly observed a \ufb01nite, semiconductor-like, history-\ndependent conductance after loading DNA solution and\n3\nremoving the bu\ufb00er solution. The inset of Fig. 3 is a rep-\nresentative I-Vcurve of the bu\ufb00er salt residue, 1 \u00d7TE.\nSuch spurious signals are of particular concern when\nDNA is laid down on electrodes in a thick bundle, be-\ncause the salts trapped between the DNA molecules can\nform conduction paths. The spurious background van-\nished after we adopted the following procedure. Chips\ncontaining bridging DNA molecules were carefully rinsed\nin 5 mM ammonium acetate (NH 4Ac, pH 6.6), a volatile\nbu\ufb00er that can be completely removed in high vacuum.\nA drawback of this rinsing is that a large fraction of the\nanchored DNA molecules are cut after rinsing and dry-\ning. However, rinsing in 10 mM MgSO 4/40 mM Tris-\nHCl (pH 8) beforethe NH 4Ac rinsing introduces Mg2+\nions which coat the quartz surface with weak positive\ncharges [6]. As the negatively charged DNA molecules\nstick to the substrate by electrostatic interaction, dam-\nagedue to NH 4Ac rinsing is minimized. PanelC of Fig. 2\nshows a typical image of anchored DNA after Mg2+and\nNH4Ac rinsing. [Rinsing with the MgSO 4solution also\nled to binding of unmodi\ufb01ed \u03bb-DNA. However, the yield\nof anchored molecules was much smaller.]\nTo perform the electrical measurements, unstained\nthiol-modi\ufb01ed \u03bb-DNA was attached to the Au electrodes\nas described above. After the \ufb01nal NH 4Ac rinsing, the\nchip was dried in the dark to avoid possible photon-\ninduced damage. Two-probe I-Vmeasurements were\nperformed in moderately high vacuum ( <10\u22127Torr).\nA typical room-temperature I-Vcurve, measured on\n\u03bb-DNA spanning electrodes 4 \u00b5m apart, is shown in\nthe main panel of Fig.3. The voltage was swept be-\ntween\u00b120 V. A linear \ufb01t to the data in Fig. 3 yields\ndI/dV= (\u22123\u00b19)\u00d710\u221214S. Using a cross-section of \u223c3\nnm2per molecule, and the estimated number of bridging\nmolecules ( \u223c1000), we obtain the bound on the resistiv-\nity of\u03c1 >106\u2126cm in electric \ufb01elds Eup to\u223c104V/cm.\nMeasurements performed on several chips yielded consis-\ntent results. No current was detected within the noise\nlevel of our measurement( \u223c \u00b110 pA), despite sustained\nand deliberate e\ufb00orts to improve electrical contacts be-\ntween the base pair stack of \u03bb-DNA and Au.\nImmediately after the measurements, a bu\ufb00er solution\nwith an appropriate amount of TOTO1 dye dissolved in\n1\u00d7TE was loaded on the chip. By direct optical mi-\ncroscopy inspection of the post-stained DNA, we con-\n\ufb01rmed that there were \u223c1000 DNA molecules bridging\nthe electrodes, and thus the measurements did not de-\nstroy the DNA.\nAs a \ufb01nal check that the observed images are those of\n\u03bb-DNA, we introduce DNase to digest the molecules [29].\nComplete deletion of all \ufb02uorescent DNA molecules was\nobserved. These tests leave very little room for doubt\nthat a large number of intactDNA molecules were chem-\nically bound to the electrodes during the electrical mea-\nsurements [25].\nThe bound \u03c1 >106\u2126cm in our experiment and the\nFIG. 3: The two-probe current vs. voltage ( I-V) curve for a\nsample of \u03bb-DNA bridging 2 parallel Au electrodes separated\nby 4\u00b5m (the sample comprises \u223c1000 molecules). The DNA\nwas rinsed with NH 4Ac before the measurement to remove\nthe bu\ufb00er salt residue. The dashed line is a linear \ufb01t to the\ndata. The inset shows the two-probe I-Vcurve for a test chip\ncontaining 1 \u00d7TE bu\ufb00er solution (without DNA). The chip\nwas dried in vacuum but not subject to NH 4Ac rinsing. The\nobserved conductance is entirely from trace TE salt residue .\nBoth measurements were done in vacuum ( <10\u22127Torr) at\n295 K. Open-circuit impedance between any two electrodes\nwas always \u226b10 T\u2126.\nlarge bias potential applied (20 V) is at odds with\nmany recent reports of moderately high conductivity.\nIn some DC experiments, the DNA molecules formed\nbundles or networks between the microfabricated elec-\ntrodes [26, 27, 28]. As noted above, high conductance\nmay arise from residual salts trapped between the DNA\nstrands. Contamination from other sources (C or Re)\nmaybeaproblemaswellinthe experimentonproximity-\ninduced superconductivity in \u03bb-DNA [7]. Microwave\nabsorption experiments have been used to infer that\n\u03c1\u22431 \u2126cm at 295 K in \u03bb-DNA [30]. The high mi-\ncrowave conductivity, 106times larger than our bound,\nis very di\ufb03cult to reconcile with our data. If \u03bb-DNA had\nsuch a high uniform conductivity, all the applied poten-\ntial should fall across the contacts ( \u223c2-3 nm) to produce\nanE-\ufb01eld\u223c108V/cm, high enough to produce a large\ntunnelingcurrent, ifnotbreakdownofthecontactbarrier\naltogether. This isnot observed. Possibly, the microwave\n4\nis detecting very short dissipative regions embedded in\nthe insulating molecule.\nTwo groups recently used electrostatic force mi-\ncroscopy to probe the electrostatic polarization of\nDNA [8, 9]. Our results are consistent with their con-\nclusion that DNA is insulating. However, the electro-\nstatic force microscopy technique probes conductivity in\nthe limit of weak bias potentials, so it does not rule out a\ntransition to moderately large conductivity above a bias\nthreshold of several volts (as reported in some experi-\nments [4, 31]). The present experiments show that insu-\nlating behavior extends to bias potentials as high as 20\nvolts.\nWe are grateful to P. M.

It is long k nown that\u03b1-\nhelices undergo asharptransitiontowards arandomcoil statewhe nthetemperature\nis increased. The characteristics of this so-called helix-coil transit ion have been\nstudied extensively [1], most recently in Refs. [2, 3]. In Refs. [4, 5] ev idence was\npresented thatthehelix-coil transitioninpolyalanineexhibits atrue thermodynamic\nphase transition when interactions between all atoms in the molecule are taken into\naccount [4, 5].\nThelaterresultswereobtainedfromgas-phasesimulationsofpoly- alanine. While\nthereissomeexperimental evidence [6]supportingthenumerical r esultsofthese gas-\nphase simulations, the question remains how these results relate to the biologically\nmore relevant case of solvated molecules. First investigations of th is question were\ndescribed in Refs.[7, 8] where it was claimed that the transition tempe rature is lower\n1E-mail:ypeng@mtu.edu\n2E-mail: hansmann@mtu.edu; to whom all correspondence should be a ddressed\n1\nin water than in vacuum. However, that investigation relies on a single represen-\ntation of the protein-water interaction and the dependence of th eir results on the\ndetails of the solvation term is not clear.\nIn this paper, we have investigated how the characteristics of helix -coil transition\nchange with the details of the solvation term. For this purpose, we h ave performed\nmulticanonical simulations of polyalanine molecules of length 10. The pr otein-water\ninteraction was included in two ways: either by a distance-dependen t dielectric per-\nmittivity or by a term that is proportional to the solvent-accessible surface area of\nthe peptide. For the later case we have considered four di\ufb00erent p arameter sets:\nOONS [9], JRF [10], W92 [11] and SCH [12]. Quantities such as the energy, helicity\nand susceptibility were calculated as function of temperature. Our result were com-\npared with that of gas phase simulations. A strong dependence of t he characteristics\nof the helix-coil transition from the details of the solvation term was found.\n2 Methods\nOur investigation of the helix-coil transition for polyalanine is based o n a detailed,\nall-atom representation of that homopolymer. The interaction bet ween the atoms\nwas described by a standard force \ufb01eld, ECEPP/2,[13] (as implement ed in the pro-\ngram package SMMP [14]) and is given by:\nEtot=EC+ELJ+EHB+Etor, (1)\nEC=/summationdisplay\n(i,j)332qiqj\n\u01ebrij, (2)\nELJ=/summationdisplay\n(i,j)/parenleftBiggAij\nr12\nij\u2212Bij\nr6\nij/parenrightBigg\n, (3)\nEHB=/summationdisplay\n(i,j)/parenleftBiggCij\nr12\nij\u2212Dij\nr10\nij/parenrightBigg\n, (4)\nEtor=/summationdisplay\nlUl(1\u00b1cos(nl\u03c7l)).

In the \ufb01rst model (DDE) the elect rostatic\ninteractions in the presence of water rely on a distance dependent electrostatic per-\nmittivity [15]:\n\u03b5(r) =D\u2212D\u22122\n2[(sr)2+2sr+2]e\u2212sr. (6)\nFor the parameters Dandsempirical values are chosen such that for large distances\nthe permittivity takes the value of bulk water ( \u03b5\u224880), and the value \u03b5= 2 for short\ndistances (protein interior space). Equation (6) is the result of int erpolation of two\ntypes of interactions. For short distances it models the interactio n of two charges\nplaced in continuum medium, while over long distances it represents a D ebye curve.\nThis is clearly a gross over-simpli\ufb01cation of protein-solvent interact ions. However,\napproximating solvation e\ufb00ects by a distance-dependent dielectric permittivity was\nused by many authors to study the proteins and nucleic acids (e.g. [1 6]) since it\ndoes not signi\ufb01cantly slow down protein simulations below that of simple in vacuo\nsimulations.\nInanothercommonapproximationoftheprotein-solvent interact iononeassumes\nthat the free energy contributions from atomic groups immersed in the protein in-\nterior di\ufb00er from contributions of groups exposed to the water. I t is commonly\naccepted [9, 11, 17, 18] that this free-energy di\ufb00erence is propo rtional to the surface\narea of the atomic group which is exposed to the solvent. Within this a pproxima-\ntion, the total solvation energy of a protein is given by the sum of co ntributions\nfrom each solvated atomic groups:\nEsol=/summationdisplay\ni\u03c3iAi, (7)\nwhereEsolis the solvation energy, Aiis the conformational dependent solvent acces-\nsible area of the surface of the i\u2212thatom and\u03c3iis the atomic solvation parameter\nfor the atom i. The summation is extended over all atomic groups. The solvation\nparameters are evaluated experimentally by measuring the free en ergy needed to\nbring the group from a nonpolar environment (usually octanol or et hanol are used\nas convenient compounds) into water. Many sets of solvation para meters were eval-\nuated by several authors with di\ufb00erent methods, but unfortuna tely it is not always\nobvious which one isthemost appropriateone. The sets we study he re arenamed by\nus OONS [9], JRF [10], W92 [11] and SCH [12], and are described in the resp ective\nreferences.\n3\nSimulations of detailed models of biological macromolecules are notorio usly dif-\n\ufb01cult. This is because the various competing interactions within the p olymer lead\nto an energy landscape characterized by a multitude of local minima. Hence, in\nthe low-temperature region, canonical Monte Carlo or molecular dy namics simu-\nlations will tend to get trapped in one of these minima and the simulation will\nnot thermalize within the available CPU time. Only recently, with the intr oduc-\ntion of new and sophisticated algorithms such as multicanonical sampling [19] and\nothergeneralized-ensemble techniques [20] was it possible to alleviate this problem\nin protein simulations [21]. For polyalanine, both the failure of standar d Monte\nCarlo techniques and the superior performance of the multicanonic al algorithm are\nextensively documented in earlier work [22]. For this reason, we use a gain this\nsophisticated simulation technique for our project.\nIn the multicanonical algorithm [19] conformations with energy Eare assigned\na weightwmu(E)\u221d1/n(E). Here,n(E) is the density of states. A simulation with\nthis weight will lead to a uniform distribution of energy:\nPmu(E)\u221dn(E)wmu(E) = const. (8)\nThis is because the simulation generates a 1D random walk in the energ y space,\nallowing itself to escape from any local minimum. Since a large range of e nergies are\nsampled, one can use the reweighting techniques [23] to calculate th ermodynamic\nquantities over a wide range of temperatures Tby\n<A>T=/integraltextdxA(x)w\u22121(E(x))e\u2212\u03b2E(x)\n/integraltextdxw\u22121(E(x))e\u2212\u03b2E(x), (9)\nwherexstands for con\ufb01gurations.\nUnlike in the case of canonical simulations the weights\nw(E) =n\u22121(E) =e\u2212S(E)(10)\nare not a priori known. Instead estimators for these weights hav e to be determined.\nThis is often done by an iterative procedure in which for reasons of n umerical sta-\nbility Eq. 10 is replaced by\nw(E) =e\u2212\u03b2(E)E\u2212\u03b1(E). (11)\nThe multicanonical parameters \u03b2(E) and\u03b1(E) are de\ufb01ned through\n\u03b2(E) =S(E\u2032)\u2212S(E)\nE\u2032\u2212Eand\u03b1(E) =/braceleftBigg\n0 , E\u2265Emax\n\u03b1(E\u2032)+(\u03b2(E\u2032)\u2212\u03b2(E))E\u2032, E <E max\n(12)\n4\nwithEandE\u2032adjacent bins in the array S(E). The\u03b2(E) are then iteratively\nupdated [24] by the relation\n\u03b2i+1(E) =\u03b2i(E)+g0(E)\u00b7/parenleftBig\nlnHi(E\u2032)\u2212lnHi(E)/parenrightBig\n/(E\u2032\u2212E),(13)\nin whichHi(E) is the histogram of the i-th run (and H(E)\u22651). In Ref. [24] the\nfactorg0(E) in Eq. 13 was de\ufb01ned through\ng0(E) =\u02c6gi(E)\n\u02c6gi(E)+/summationtexti\u22121\nj\u02c6gj(E)with \u02c6gi(E) =Hi(E\u2032)\u00b7Hi(E)\nHi(E\u2032)+Hi(E).(14)\nThe above relation assumes that the histogram H(E) counts independent events\nwhich is in general not true. Hence, it is more appropriate and leads t o a faster\nconvergence of \u03b2(E) if the array \u02c6 gi(E) in Eq. 14 is instead de\ufb01ned by\n\u02c6gi(E) =Ki(E\u2032)Ki(E)\nKi(E\u2032)+Ki(E)(15)\nwhere the auxiliary array K(E) now counts only the number of independent visits\nat energyE.\nWith the above described iterative procedure we needed 200,000 sw eeps for the\nweight factor calculations. All thermodynamic quantities were then estimated from\none production run of 1 ,000,000 Monte Carlo sweeps starting from a random initial\nconformation, i.e. without introducing any bias.\n3 Results and Discussion\nIn previous gas-phase simulations of poly-alanine [3, 4, 5, 22] we obs erved atT=\n430Ka pronounced transition between a high-temperature phase domin ated by dis-\norderedcoil structures andanorderedphasewithsingle, extend ed helices. Anatural\norder parameter for this helix-coil transition is the average numbe r< nH(T)>of\nresidues in the oligomer which are part of an \u03b1\u2212helix. Following earlier work [22]\nwe de\ufb01ne a residue as helical if the pair of backbone dihedral angles \u03c6,\u03c8takes a\nvalue in the range ( \u221270\u00b120,\u221237\u00b120). In Fig. 1a this order parameter is displayed\nas function of temperature for a gas-phase simulation (GP) of Ala 10and simulations\nwith the various solvation terms. Fig. 1b shows the corresponding p lots for the\nsusceptibility \u03c7(T) de\ufb01ned by\n\u03c7(T) =<n2\nH(T)>\u2212<nH(T)>2. (16)\n5\nIn Fig. 1a and 1b the curves, representing the various simulations, fall into\nthree groups. For the case where the protein-solvent interactio n was approximated\nby a distance-dependent permittivity (DDE), both < nH>and\u03c7have a similar\ntemperature dependence than is observed for poly-alanine in gas- phase simulations\n(GP). However, the transition temperature Tcis shifted from T= 435\u00b120 K (gas-\nphase) to a highervalueT= 495\u00b120. This temperature was determined from the\nmaximum of the susceptibility \u03c7(T) in Fig. 1b and is listed in table 1. To the same\ngroup belong the simulations in which the solvation energy was approx imated by\na solvent accessible surface term with either the OONS [9] or SCH [12] parameter\nset. In both cases susceptibility \u03c7and order parameter < nH(T)>show also a\ntemperature dependence similar to the one of gas-phase simulation s. Only now,\nthe transition temperature Tcis shifted to lowertemperatures. The corresponding\ntransitiontemperatures canbeagaindetermined fromtheposition softhemaximum\nin\u03c7(T) and are also listed in table 1. The shift towards lower temperatures was one\nof the main results reported in Refs. [7, 8] for simulations with the OO NS solvation\nenergy, and our Tc= 345\u00b120 K agrees well with their value Tc= 340 K (no errors\nquoted) in Refs. [7, 8].\nA somehow di\ufb00erent behavior is observed in the simulation where the p rotein-\nwater interaction was approximated by a solvent accessible surfac e term relying on\nthe W92 [11] parameter set. Here, the form of <nH>indicates only partial helix\nformation and occurs only at much lower temperatures. The susce ptibility\u03c7(T) in\nFig. 1b gives no indication for a helix-coil transition. For this reason n o value ofTc\nis listed for the W92 parameter set in table 1. Instead, we observe in Fig. 2 for this\ncase at low temperatures even the appearance of residues whose backbone dihedral\nangles\u03c6,\u03c8take values typical for a \u03b2-sheet (\u2212150\u00b130,150\u00b130).\nYet another behavior is observed in simulations where the solvation e nergy of\nEq. 7 is evaluated by means of the JRF parameter set. No formation of helices\nor sheets is observed in Figs. 1 and 2. Since no transition temperatu re can be\ndetermined, we do not list a value of Tcfor the JRF parameter set in table 1.\nThe same grouping can be found in Fig. 3a-f where we display various e nergy\nterms as a function of temperature. In these \ufb01gures we have shif ted the solvation\nenergies and the partial ECEPP/2 energies EC,ELJ,EHBandEtorof Eq. 5 by a\nconstant term such that we have for all solvation models at T= 1000 KEsol= 0 and\nEC=ELJ=EHB=Etor= 0. Such a shift by an irrelevant constant allows a better\ncomparison of the di\ufb00erent simulations. The average total energy < Etot>which\n6\nis the sum of intramolecular potential energy EECEEP/ 2and the solvation energy\nEsol, is displayed in Fig. 3a. We observe again that simulations with the para meters\nsets OONS and SCH, and such with distant dependent permittivity (D DE), have\na similar temperature dependence as gas phase simulations (GP). On the other\nhand, in simulations relying on the W92 parameter set, the energy va ries less with\ntemperature and is at low temperatures considerably higher than in the simulations\nwith other solvation energy terms. Finally, the energy in simulations w ith the JRF\nparameter set is an almost linear function of temperature and is esp ecially at high\ntemperatures much lower than the energies found in gas phase simu lations.\nThe dissimilar behavior of energy for simulations with di\ufb00erent solvatio n terms\nis even more obvious in Fig. 3b where the average intramolecular ener gyEECEPP/ 2\nis drawn. While this energy term decreases between 1000 K and 150 K by\u224850\nKcal/mol (with most of that change, \u224830 Kcal/mol, happing around the respective\ntransition temperature Tc) in gas-phase simulations (GP) and in simulations with\nOONS, SCH and DDE solvation terms, it changes in the same temperat ure interval\nonly by\u224820 Kcal/mol in simulations utilizing the JRF or W92 parameter sets.\nSince for these two parameter sets also no or only little helix formatio n was observed\nit seems likely that the formation of helices is related to the large gain in potential\nenergy observed for GP, OONS,SCH and DDE simulations. This gain in po tential\nenergy is in part due to the formation of hydrogen bonds between a residue and\nthe fourth following one in the polypeptide chain which stabilize an \u03b1-helix. Fig. 3c\ndisplays the average hydrogen-bonding energy < EHB>of Eq. 5 as a function of\ntemperature and one can clearly see the gain in energy for the GP, D DE, OONS and\nSCH simulations at the respective helix-coil transition temperature s of table 1. No\nsuch gainis observed in W92 andJRFsimulations where also no helix form ationwas\nfound. A similar gain in energy with helix formations in gas-phase and sim ulations\nwith DDE,OONS and SCH solvent representations is also observed for the average\nLennard-Jones energy < ELJ>and the electrostatic energy < EC>displayed in\nFig. 3d and 3e, respectively. Note also in Fig. 3e the large gain in ECfor DDE at\nthe helix-coil transition temperature which additionally stabilizes the \u03b1-helix in this\nmodel.\nA complementary picture is found in Fig. 3f where the solvation energ yEsol\nis shown as a function of temperature. The observed helix formatio n in gas phase\nsimulationsandsuchwithOONS,SCHandDDEsolvent representations iscorrelated\nwith an increases of the solvation energies by \u22485 Kcal/mol. On the other hand,\n7\nin simulations with the W92 and JRF parameter sets, for which no helix- formation\nwas observed in Fig. 1, Esoldecreases with temperature. This decrease is only \u22485\nkcal/mol for W92, but it is much larger (of order 30 kcal/mol) in the ca se of JRF\nwhere the solvation energy is the dominant term.\nThee\ufb00ectsofthedominantsolvationterminsimulationswiththeJRFp arameter\nset can also be seen in Fig. 4. In this \ufb01gure the average radius of gyr ation, a measure\nfor the compactness of con\ufb01gurations, is shown as a function tem perature. One can\nsee that this quantity changes little with temperature for the JRF d ata. However,\nits value is over the whole temperature range considerably smaller th an observed in\nthe other simulations. This indicates that the JRF solvation term fav ors already at\nhigh temperatures compact con\ufb01gurations, and that the pressu re towards compact\nstructure is such that the more elongated helices cannot be forme d. Note however,\nthat the tendency towards compact con\ufb01gurations does not lead to a lower Lennard-\nJones energy ELJas one would expect. Fig. 3d indicates that < ELJ>is at low\ntemperatures in JRF simulations even larger than in GP, DDE, OONS an d SCG\nsimulations where helix-formation was observed. The tendency tow ards compact\nstructures in JRF simulations may be due to the fact that JRF param eter set was\ndeveloped from minimum energy (i.e. compact) conformations of pep tides (the\nlow-energy conformations of 13 tetrapeptides derived by NMR stu dies [10]), and\ntherefore this parameter set may have an intrinsic bias towards co mpact structures.\nOn the other hand, the W92 parameter set was developed from mea surements of\nfree energies of amino acid side chain analogs from vapor to water [26 ]. The param-\neters for this set are negative for all atoms except carbon meanin g that the nitrogen,\noxygen and sulfur atoms are considered hydrophilic, i.e. favoring so lvent exposure.\nThis explains not only the small solvation energies observed for this p arameter set\nin Fig. 3f, but also why in Fig. 4 the radius of gyration is consistently lar ger for\nthis parameter set than for the others indicating that extended c on\ufb01gurations are\nfavored with this parameter set. This bias towards extended stru ctures limits again\nthe formation of \u03b1-helices.\nWhile the OONS parameter set was derived from experimental free e nergies of\ngas-to-water transfer of small aliphatic and aromatic molecules, t he SCH is not\ndirectly based on experimental free energy data. Instead, it was developed as an\noptimized parameter set to complement the CHARMM force \ufb01eld [25]. I n both\nparameter sets the hydrophobic character of the carbon atoms is increased and the\nhydrophilic character of uncharge oxygen and nitrogen atoms dec reased resulting\n8\ninto the large solvation energies of these two parameter sets (whe n compared with\nthe one of the W92 parameter set) that one observes in Fig. 3f. Th e OONS andSCH\nsolvation energies again favor extended structures (the radius o f gyration has larger\nvalues than found in gas-phase simulations), however, the interpla y of solvation\nenergies and intramolecular ECEPP/2 energy is such that the radius of gyrations\n(and consequently the compactness) of polyalanine con\ufb01guration s as a function of\ntemperature shows a similar behavior as the gas-phase simulation. T he same is true\nfor the DDE simulation where the protein-solvent interaction was ap proximated by\na distance-dependent permittivity.\nOur results demonstrate that the helix formation is due to the gain in poten-\ntial (intramolecular) energy while (with the exception of the JRF par ameter set)\nthe solvent-accessible surface terms favor extended peptide co n\ufb01gurations. Table 2\nsummarizes the di\ufb00erences in total energy \u2206 Etot, solvation energy \u2206 Esol, poten-\ntial energy \u2206 EECEEP/ 2, and the partial energies \u2206 EC, \u2206ELJ, \u2206EHBand \u2206Etor\nbetween complete helical con\ufb01gurations (all residues with exceptio n of the terminal\nones are part of an \u03b1-helix) and coil con\ufb01gurations at temperature T= 300 K for\ngas-phase, DDE OONS and SCH simulations. Note, that the intramole cular energy\ndi\ufb00erences \u2206 EECEPP/ 2of gas-phase, OONS and SCH simulations have within their\nerror bars the same values. For simulations with the W92 parameter set the longest\nfound helix consists of 6 consecutive residues. Hence, we measure d for this case only\nthe energy di\ufb00erence between con\ufb01gurations with at least three c onsecutive helical\nresidues (i.e. one turn of an \u03b1-helix) and coil con\ufb01gurations. This modi\ufb01ed de\ufb01ni-\ntion of the energy di\ufb00erences is also the reason for the smaller value of \u2206EECEPP/ 2\nlisted for W92 in table 2. We do not list energy di\ufb00erences for the JRF p arameter\nset since no helices were found in simulations utilizing this parameter se t.\nNote that in simulations with distant dependent permittivity (DDE) he lices are\nenergetically more favored than in the gas-phase simulations. This is due to the\nincreased contribution from the Coulomb term ECas one can also see in Fig. 3e.\nThe larger energy gap between helical and coil conformations (whe n compared with\ngas-phase simulations) explains why the transition temperature is h igher in DDE\nsimulations than in gas-phase simulations.\nFortheOONSandtheSCHparametersetthesolvationenergydi\ufb00er ence\u2206Esolis\npositive (indicating that coil structures are energetically favored ), but its magnitude\nisonlyapproximatelyhalfthatofthepotentialenergydi\ufb00erence\u2206 EECEPP/ 2. Hence,\nthere is still an overall energetic gain connected with helix formation . However,\n9\nin both cases the total energy di\ufb00erence between helical and coil c on\ufb01gurations is\nreduced by the solvationenergy when compared withthe gas-phas e simulation. This\nreduction of the energy gap leads to the lower transition temperat ures observed in\nOONS and SCH simulations.\nOn the other hand, for the W92 parameter set we \ufb01nd that \u2206 EECCP/ 2and\n\u2206Esolare of same magnitude so that helical con\ufb01gurations are not or only weakly\nenergetically favored. This is consistent with our results in Fig. 1a an d 1b where\nwe \ufb01nd atT= 280 K a high average helicity in OONS and SCH simulations but\nonly a small value of < nH>and no indications for a helix-coil transition in W92\nsimulations. An evaluation of energy di\ufb00erences was not possible for simulations\nwith the JRF parameter set since no helices were found.\nThe above results indicate that the existence and characteristics of the helix-coil\ntransition in polyalanine depend strong on the details of the solvent r epresentation.\nIn order to evaluate the validity of the di\ufb00erent solvent models one h as to compare\nthe numerical results with experimental data. For this purpose we have calculated\nthe helix propagation parameter swhich was also determined by experiments [28,\n29]. According to the Zimm-Bragg model [27] the average number of helical residues\n<n>and the average length <\u2113>of a helical segment are given for large number\nof residues Nby\n<n>\nN=1\n2\u22121\u2212s\n2/radicalBig\n(1\u2212s)2+4s\u03c3, (17)\n<\u2113> = 1+2s\n1\u2212s+/radicalBig\n(1\u2212s)2+4s\u03c3, (18)\nwheresis the helix propagation parameter and \u03c3the nucleation parameter of the\nZimm-Bragg model. From these equations with the values of <n>/N and< \u2113 >\ncalculated from the multicanonical production runs, we have calcula tedsat tem-\nperatureT= 280 K for gas-phase and the di\ufb00erent solvation models. Our values are\nsummarized in table 3 which also lists our \u03c3values. Our results for gas-phase, DDE\nand OONS simulations are in agreement with the experimental results of Ref. [29]\nwhere they list values of s(Ala) between 1 .5 and 2.19. On the other hand, the s\nvalue obtained in the SCH simulation agrees well with the one obtained b y the host-\nguest technique of Ref. [28]. However, the svalues which were obtained in W92 or\nJRF simulations do not agree with either of the experimental data. H ence, we con-\nclude that the W92 and JRF parameter sets are not appropriate so lvation models\nin simulations of polyalanine. Otherwise, the variation in the experimen tal data is\n10\ntoo large to give indications whether one of the remaining solvent rep resentations\n(DDE, OONS, SCH or even no solvent at all (GP)) is preferable over t he others.\n4 Conclusions\nWe have performed multicanonical simulations of polyalanine. The intr amolecular\nforces were modeled by the ECEPP/2 force \ufb01eld and various approx imations for the\nsolvation energy were studied. We observed that whether a helix-c oil transition is\nobserved for poly-alanine, and at what temperature, depends st rongly on the chosen\napproximation for the protein-solvent interaction. Our results de monstrate both the\nimportance (and need) of including solvation terms into protein simula tions and the\ndi\ufb03culties in chosing an adequate representation of the protein-wa ter interactions.\nEspecially when using the solvent-accessible surface approach, it s eems necessary to\ncarefullychoosea parameterset that issuitable fortheproblemun der consideration.\nUse of a speci\ufb01c parameter set without further justi\ufb01cation could otherwise generate\nmiss-leading results.\nAcknowledgement\nU.Hansmann gratefullyacknowledges support byaresearch gran tfromtheNational\nScience Foundation (CHE-9981874).

We focus on the biologically relevant cases of linear and cyclic\npeptides. Our approach leads to an e\ufb03cient, Boltzmann-weighted s ampling of the torsional\ndegrees of freedom in these biological molecules, a feat not possible with previous Monte\nCarlo and molecular dynamics methods.\n2\n1 Introduction\nThis paper presents a new Monte Carlo method that employs biased t rial moves to achieve\nan e\ufb03cient sampling of the torsional degrees of freedom for linear a nd cyclic peptides.\nPeptides are small molecules, built from amino acids, that are of fund amental impor-\ntance in biological systems [1]. They play key roles in signal transduct ion between cells,\nregulation of cell growth and di\ufb00erentiation, and protein localization on cell surfaces [2].\nPeptides are thought to regulate neurotransmission, from modula ting pain and thirst to\na\ufb00ecting memory and emotion [3, 4]. They are used as a chemical defe nse mechanism by\nsome organisms. The conussnails, for example, produce a family of highly-constrained\npeptides that include very powerful neurotoxins [5]. Finally, peptide s are used within the\nbiotechnology industry to identify antagonists blocking various abn ormal enzymatic ac-\ntions or ligand-receptor interactions [6]. Cyclic or otherwise constr ained peptides are often\npreferred for this application, since such molecules su\ufb00er less of a lo ss of con\ufb01gurational\nentropy upon binding [7]. A classic example is the use of the RGD peptide to block the\nGPIIb/IIIa-\ufb01bronectin interaction, reducing blood platelet aggr egation [8, 9].\nThe properties of peptides are amenable to examination by compute r experiment. An\nearly study was of the alanine dipeptide, in which the potential energ y surface was de-\nduced from ab initio quantum mechanical calculations [10, 11]. Larger peptides have bee n\nexamined by classical simulations. Both molecular dynamics [12] and Mo nte Carlo [13]\napproaches have proven useful. The e\ufb00ects of the aqueous envir onment have been incorpo-\nrated by simple dielectric theory [14, 15, 16, 17] or by explicit inclusion of water molecules\n[18].\nIt has become clear, however, that the standard molecular dynam ics and Monte Carlo\nmethods are not capable of sampling all conformational degrees of freedom accessible at\nbody temperature to the larger peptides. This problem is particular ly evident for the im-\nportant case of constrained peptides. Various solutions, such as high-temperature molec-\nular dynamics [19, 20] or simpli\ufb01ed force \ufb01elds [20, 21], have been sugg ested, but these\napproaches su\ufb00er from uncontrolled approximations. A simulation m ethod able to sample\nthe relevant conformational states of peptides, particularly con strained ones, or exposed\nloops of larger proteins would be of great value. It would aid study of these molecules in bi-\nologicalsystems aswell asfacilitatestructuralunderstanding of thepeptides andantibodies\nof interest to the biotechnology industry.\n3\nRecently, powerful Monte Carlo methods have been developed tha t have a greatly en-\nhanced sampling e\ufb03ciency [22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. These met hods have been\napplied to chain molecules at low and high density [24, 30] and even at ph ase coexistence\n[31, 32, 33, 34]. These methods all use importance sampling, or biase d moves, to e\ufb03ciently\nexplore the free energy landscape.\nWehereapplytheseconceptstopeptidemolecules. Bothlinearandc onstrainedorcyclic\npeptidesaretreatedbythismethod. InSec.2wedescribetheMon teCarlomethodindetail.\nAppendices describe therigidmolecular fragmentsfromwhichpeptid es areconstructed and\nprovidetechnical detailsofthemethod. InSec. 3we describethea pplicationofthismethod\nto the prototypical polyglycine peptides. We discuss the results in S ec. 4. The superiority\nof this method over conventional molecular dynamics and Monte Car lo is demonstrated.\nConclusions are presented in Sec. 5.\n2 Monte Carlo Method\nWemake thesimplifying assumption that the intramolecular potential energy contains only\ntorsional and non-bonded terms. That is, bond lengths and angles are \ufb01xed, and rotation\nis allowed only about sigma bonds. At room- or body-temperature, t hese are fairly good\nassumptions. They could easily be relaxed, although sampling the incr eased degrees of\nfreedom would entail a computational expense. Appendix A describ es the rigid fragments\nthat occur in peptides under these assumptions. A suitable form fo r the interatomic po-\ntential would be the AMBER [35], ECCEP [36], or CHARMm [37] force \ufb01eld. We pick\nthe AMBER potentials. Water is treated in an implicit way, assuming the dielectric con-\nstant for Coulomb interactions is given by \u01eb/\u01eb0= 4r, withrgiven in \u02daAngstroms. These\nassumptions allow the method to be presented without a discussion o f detailed force \ufb01eld\nissues. The method is generically applicable to better force \ufb01elds and an explicit treatment\nof water.\nA con\ufb01gurational bias Monte Carlo (CBMC) technique is used to explo re the conforma-\ntions of the molecules. We describe the algorithm for both linear and c yclic peptides. By\ncyclic, we mean peptides constrained because of disul\ufb01de bonds bet ween cystine residues.\nThere are two types of atoms in a peptide, those in the side chains an d those in the\nbackbone. Consequently, there are two types of Monte Carlo mov es: type I moves change\nthe positions of side chain atoms only, and type II moves change the positions of backbone\natoms, rigidly rotating the attached side chains. The type I move is a n extension of the\n4\nchain-molecule CBMC [24, 25] to the structurally more complicated ca se of peptides. The\ntype I move is applicable to side chains with a free end ( i.e.all naturally occurring amino\nacid side chains except for proline). The backbone to which the side c hain is attached can\nbe either linear or cyclic. In the cyclic case, the type I move is also use d to change the\ncon\ufb01guration of the free ends of the main chain.\nTherearetwokindsoftypeIImovesforthebackbone: typeIIam ovesforlinearpeptides\nand type IIb moves for cyclic peptides. The type IIa move is essent ially the same as a type\nI move. The side-chain residues that are attached to the backbon e are rigidly rotated so\nas to remain properly bonded to the C \u03b1atoms in their new positions. When the peptide\nis cyclic, we use a type IIb move to change the con\ufb01guration of part of the backbone loop,\nrigidly rotating any side chains or free ends of the peptide that are a ttached to that part of\nthe backbone. The backbone of a cyclic peptide includes the atoms a long the main chain\nas well as the C \u03b2and S atoms of the cystines participating in the disul\ufb01de bond. This\nmove requires a concerted rotation of the backbone torsional an gles with a rigid rotation\nof the attached side groups. This concerted rotation of the tors ional angles is an extension\nof the concerted rotation scheme for alkanes [22, 28].\nA type I move is initiated by identifying the side chain to be regrown. No t all of the side\nchain need be regrown, and the \ufb01rst group to regrow is chosen. Th is feature is helpful for\nthe amino acids with longer side chains, such as lysine. These choices a re made randomly.\nTheMrigid units to be regrown are \ufb01rst removed and then added one at a t ime, starting\nfrom the one closest to the backbone. For each addition, the follow ing actions are carried\nout (see Fig. 1):\n1)kvalues of the torsional angle \u03c6ij,1\u2264j\u2264kconnecting rigid unit ito uniti\u22121 are\ngenerated according to the internal potential,\npint\ni(\u03c6ij)\u221dexp[\u2212\u03b2uint\ni(\u03c6ij)]. (1)\nThe function uint\ni(\u03c6ij) is the part of the internal energy that couples unit ito the rest of the\nmolecule (but excluding units i+1 toM). The inverse temperature is given by \u03b2= 1/kBT.\n2) One of these is picked with probability\npext\ni(\u03c6ij) = exp[\u2212\u03b2uext\ni(\u03c6ij)]/wext(i), (2)\nwhere\nwext(i) =k/summationdisplay\nj=1exp[\u2212\u03b2uext\ni(\u03c6ij)]. (3)\n5\nThe function uext\ni(\u03c6ij) is the part of the external energy that couples unit ito the rest of\nthe molecule (but excluding units i+1 toM).\n3) Steps 1-2 are repeated until all M units have been added.\n4) The Rosenbluth weight\nW(n)=M/productdisplay\ni=1wext(i) (4)\nis calculated. This attempted move is accepted with a probability\nacc(o\u2192n) = min[1,W(n)/W(o)]. (5)\nThe quantity W(o)is the Rosenbluth weight for the reverse move and is calculated as in\nsteps 2-4, but with k\u22121 random orientations and one orientation that is equal to the\noriginal geometry for each rigid unit.\nA type IIa move is very similar to a type I move. In this case, the direc tion of regrowth\nis chosen randomly. Then the \ufb01rst backbone unit to be regrown is ch osen. The Mrigid\nunits to be regrown are removed and added back sequentially, as in t he type I move. The\nrigid units in this case are either A-units, B-units with the side chain rig idly attached, C-\nunits, or D-units (see appendix A). An alternative procedure would be to regrow the side\nchain units as well, but this proved not to be e\ufb03cient, due to frequen t steric repulsions.\nThe move is accepted with the probability given by Eq. (5).\nA type IIb move is initiated by identifying the 4 rigid units on the backbo ne to be\nrotated. This is done randomly. The four rigid units are labeled in an am ine to carboxy\nterminal fashion. The attached side groups are rigidly rotated with the backbone units.\nThe rotation is carried out as follows (see Fig. 2):\n1) The driver angle \u03c60is changed by an amount \u03b4\u03c60, where\u2212\u2206\u03c6<\u03b4\u03c6 0<\u2206\u03c6. This is\ndonek\u2032times with probabilities according to the internal potential,\npint(\u03c60j)\u221dexp[\u2212\u03b2uint\n0(\u03c60j)]. (6)\nThefunction uint\n0(\u03c60j)istheinternal energyassociatedwiththistorsionalangle. Onlyth ose\nvalues of\u03c60that lead to valid solutions for the modi\ufb01ed torsional angles are cons idered. In\nthe general case there will be a distinct \u03c61for each solution arising from the new value of\n\u03c60. De\ufb01nek(n)to be the number of \u03c60-\u03c61pairs. Ifk(n)= 0, the move is rejected.\n2) A\u03c60-\u03c61pair is picked with probability\npext\n0(\u03c60j,\u03c61j) = exp[\u2212\u03b2uext\n0(\u03c60j,\u03c61j)]/W(n), (7)\n6\nwhere\nW(n)=k(n)/summationdisplay\nj=1exp[\u2212\u03b2uext\n0(\u03c60j,\u03c61j)]. (8)\nThe function uext\n0(\u03c60j,\u03c61j) is the part of the external energy that couples this part of the\nbackbone to the rest of the molecule. The value J(n)of the Jacobian is calculated for the\nnew, chosen con\ufb01guration (as detailed in Appendix B).\n3) The reverse move is considered. That is, a rotation about the ne w, chosen\u03c60-\u03c61pair\nis considered. k\u2032\u22121 random values \u03b4\u03c60are chosen. The original value of \u03c60is assigned to\nthek\u2032th value. This move results in k(o)solutions for \u03c61.k(o)is always greater than zero,\nsince the original con\ufb01guration exists. (Special care is taken to en sure that the original\ncon\ufb01guration is found by the root \ufb01nding procedure.) The Rosenblu th weight is assigned\ntoW(o). The value J(o)of the Jacobian is also calculated for the original con\ufb01guration.\nThis attempted move is accepted with a probability\nacc(o\u2192n) = min[1,J(n)W(n)/J(o)W(o)]. (9)\nSplitting the energy into internal and external parts is rather arb itrary. There are\nsome constraints imposed, however, by the requirement that the normalization constants\nfor Eqs. (1) and (6) be independent of chain conformation [26]. We a ssume for simplicity\nthatuint\ni= 0. One other natural choice, however, would set the internal pa rt equal to the\ntorsional terms in Hintraand set the external part equal to the rest of H.\nForanyMonteCarloscheme toproperlysampletheBoltzmannproba bilitydistribution,\ndetailedbalance must besatis\ufb01ed. Refs. [22] and[26]prove that de tailedbalanceissatis\ufb01ed\nfor the above scheme.\n3 Application to Polyglycine\nIn this section we present the result of applying this con\ufb01gurationa l bias Monte Carlo\nmethod to two simple peptides, polyglycine G 6and constrained polyglycine CG 6C.\nFigure 3 shows the energy of linear polyglycine as a function of Monte Carlo steps. This\nrun took roughly 3 hours on a Silicon Graphics Indigo2. In Fig. 4 we show the end-to-end\nprobability distribution for this system. Gaining this degree of conve rgence took a one-day\nrun.\nFigure 5 illustrates the energy of the cyclic polyglycine as a function o f Monte Carlo\nsteps. This run took roughly 6 hours. Figure 6 provides a histogram of the number\n7\nof solutions found for each attempted concerted rotation. In ra re cases the root \ufb01nding\nprocedure failed to \ufb01nd all the roots. In the construction of this p lot, we rounded n(n)\nup when it was odd. Figure 7 shows the histogram for the C \u03b2SSC\u03b2dihedral angle, with\nthe statistics taken from a run six times as long as that illustrated in F ig. 5. To give\na feel for the barrier to rotation about this angle, we show in Fig. 8 t he potential of\nmean force. This potential was determined by umbrella sampling [38]. T his curve took\ntwo orders of magnitude longer to determine than did the probability distribution in Fig.\n7. The potential of mean force is contrasted with the energy asso ciated purely with the\nC\u03b2SSC\u03b2torsional terms. Finally, Fig. 9 shows the result of classifying the co n\ufb01gurations\nproduced by the method into distinct stable conformations. Fuzzy clustering [39] was used\nto determine the dominant conformations, with the result that the re are only two or three\ndistinct conformations within this limited simulation run. The simulation r un depicted in\nFigs. 5 and 9 took approximately 8 hours on a Silicon Graphics Indigo2.\n4 Discussion\nWe see that with a very modest computational e\ufb00ort, we can achiev e equilibrated results\nfor linear peptides. With somewhat more e\ufb00ort, we can achieve equilib ration for cyclic\npeptides.\nAs expected, we \ufb01nd that the linear peptide G 6is relatively unstructured in solution.\nThereisacommoncrumpled state, butthereisalsoasigni\ufb01cant popu lationoftheextended\nstate. The constraint of the disul\ufb01de bond in CG 6C, in contrast, forces that molecule to\nadopt a limited number of molecular conformations. For the fairly sho rt runs illustrated\nin Figs. 5,6,7 and 9, we \ufb01nd only three dominant conformations. The \ufb01r st conformation is\nassociated with the C \u03b2SSC\u03b2torsional angle of 290\u25e6, whereas the other two are associated\nwith angles of 88\u25e6and 98\u25e6. The \ufb01rst of these conformations is very tight, with 0.7 \u02daA\n\ufb02uctuations about the mean for all atoms in the molecule. The other two are somewhat\nlooser, with roughly 1.2 \u02daA \ufb02uctuations. We see from Fig. 9 that even in this short run the\nmethod revisits previous conformations. In the limit of a long simulatio n, the time spent in\neach conformation would, of course, be proportional to the expo nential of the free energy\nof the conformation.\nIf CG6C were achiral, the potential of mean force in Fig. 8 would be symmetr ic about\n0\u25e6and 180\u25e6. Since the C \u03b1carbons in the cystine residues are, in fact, chiral, the potential\nof mean force is not required to be symmetric. The asymmetry seen in Fig. 8 results from\n8\nthe mean, chiral force of the rest of the molecule on the C \u03b2SSC\u03b2torsion. In fact, the\nAMBER force\ufb01eld takes this chirality into account by reducing the sy mmetry of the C \u03b2\ncarbon in cysteine. We have used this geometry [40]. The barrier at 0\u25e6is due to a high\nsteric repulsion between the hydrogens on the C \u03b2carbons adjacent to the disul\ufb01de bond.\nThis barrier is substantially higher than the barrier at 180\u25e6.\nFrom Fig. 8, we see that there is a very signi\ufb01cant free energy barr ier to rotation about\nthe C \u03b2SSC\u03b2torsional angle. This \ufb01gure was not constructed from a standard simula-\ntion run, but by the specialized procedure of umbrella sampling. It is c lear from Fig. 7,\nhowever, that the present method is able to overcome this barrier and to properly sam-\nple the relevant conformations even in a relatively short simulation. A ny method such as\nmolecular dynamics or standard Monte Carlo that makes only small, loc al changes to the\ncon\ufb01guration would never cross this barrier in a simulation of reason able length. High\ntemperature dynamics can allow systems to cross high barriers, bu t can not perform the\nrequisite Boltzmann sampling to predict the physiologically relevant co nformations. Only\na biased method that makes fairly large geometrical changes is capa ble of dealing with\nsuch barriers in an automatic way, without resort to special techn iques such as umbrella\nsampling. Furthermore, the ability to perform umbrella sampling has a s a prerequisite\nthe detailed knowledge of the important conformations and the pat hs between them. In\nour speci\ufb01c case, we \ufb01nd our method to be two orders of magnitude more e\ufb03cient than\numbrella sampling.\n5 Conclusion\nWe have presented a Monte Carlo method capable of sampling the rele vant room- or body-\ntemperature con\ufb01gurations of linear and cyclic peptides. This meth od allows the study of\npeptides important in biological and technological settings. Our sam pling of the disul\ufb01de\ndihedral angle in a prototypical cyclic peptide indicates that the met hod can explore widely\nseparated regions of conformation space according to the prope r Boltzmann distribution,\neven if the barriers between the regions are quite large. Previous s imulation methods either\nfail to sample the proper thermal distribution or are vastly more co mputationally intensive\nand require detailed knowledge of the thermally accessible regions. T he method can be\nextended to allow incorporation of explicit water molecules. The meth od can be extended\nto force \ufb01elds with \ufb02exible bonds andangles. These extensions are s ubjects for future work.\n9\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Berend Smit and Charlene X. L.

The only\ndegrees offreedom, therefore, aretorsionalangles. Duetoth eextremely highforceconstant\nforrotationabouta \u03c0bond,evensometorsionalanglesare\ufb01xedaswell. Anentirecollectio n\nof atoms that is rigid is called a rigid unit. Such a unit has an incoming bond as well as\nseveral possible outgoing bonds. There are four backbone rigidun its. Unit A is the starting\nNH+\n3group. Unit D is the terminal COO\u2212group. Unit B is the C \u03b1H group. Unit C is the\nCONH amide bond group.\nThe residues are connected to the backbone by outgoing bonds fr om the B units. Table\n1 lists the decomposition of the amino acid side chains into rigid units. Ty pical rigid\n12\nTable 1: The rigid units in peptide side groups.\nSide Group Rigid Units\nGlycine H\nAlanine CH 3\nArginine CH 2, CH2, CH2, CN3H5+\nAspartate CH 2, CO2\u2212\nAsparagine CH 2, CONH 2\nCyst(e)ine CH 2, S(H)\nGlutamate CH 2, CH2, CO2\u2212\nGlutamine CH 2, CH2, CONH 2\nHistidine CH 2, C3N2H3\nIsoleucine CH, CH 2, CH3, CH3\nLeucine CH 2, CH, CH 3, CH3\nLysine CH 2, CH2, CH2, CH2, NH3+\nMethionine CH 2, CH2, S, CH 3\nPhenylalanine CH 2, C6H5\nProline Backbone Groups: C \u03b1HCH2CH2CH2, N, CO\nSerine CH 2, OH\nThreonine CH, CH 3, OH\nTryptophan CH2, C 8NH6\nValine CH, CH 3, CH3\nTyrosine CH 2, C6H4, OH\nunits are the CH 2, CN3, CO2, and aromatic ring groups, which have substantial \u03c0bonding\ncharacter.\nProline is a special case, technically an imino acid. The special nature is due to the\ncyclic bonding of the residue to the backbone. The rigid units in this am ino acid are\nthe CH n, CO, and N groups. Only transisomers are allowed for the proline amide bond.\nProline is treated in an approximate way: the C \u03b1-C\u03b4fragment is kept rigid, the C \u03b4-N bond\nis broken, and the C \u03b1-N torsional barrier is increased. This approximation ignores the\nsmall \ufb02uctuations in the con\ufb01guration of the proline side-chain loop.\n13\nAppendix B: Concerted Rotation\nSince the molecules under consideration can be cyclic, a Monte Carlo m ove that preserves\nthis constraint is required. The \u201cconcerted rotation\u201d scheme use d for alkanes [22] can\nbe extended to allow rotation of the torsional angles in cyclic peptide s. This appendix\ndescribes this extension. The reader is referred to Ref. [22] for a fuller discussion of the\noriginal, restricted method. Themethodpresented hereallowsfor afairlygeneral molecular\ngeometry. In particular, the method naturally accommodates the constraint of a planar\namide bond.\nTo formulate the method, we consider rotating about seven torsio nal angles, which will\nmove the root positions of four rigid units, rotate up to three addit ional ones, and leave the\nrest of the peptide \ufb01xed. We de\ufb01ne the root position of a rigid unit to be the C \u03b1position\nfor a B unit, the C position for a C unit, the C position for a CH 2unit, and the S position\nfor the S unit in cystine. If unit 5 is a C unit, however, r5is de\ufb01ned to be the N position\nof that unit. For each unit we de\ufb01ne \u03b8ito be the angle between the incoming and outgoing\nbonds. Thus, \u03b8i= 0 for a C unit, and \u03b8i\u224870.5\u25e6for all others. Figure 1 illustrates the\ngeometry under consideration.\nThe method leaves the positions riof unitsi\u22640 ori\u22655 \ufb01xed. The torsion \u03c60is\nchanged by an amount \u03b4\u03c60. The values of \u03c6i,1\u2264i\u22646, are then determined so that only\nthe positions riof units 1 \u2264i\u22644 are changed.\nThe method required several de\ufb01nitions to present the solution fo r the new torsional\nangles. Vectors are de\ufb01ned which are the di\ufb00erence in position betw een unitiand unit\ni\u22121, as seen in the coordinate system of unit i:\nli=r(i)\ni\u2212r(i)\ni\u22121. (10)\nThe coordinate system of i is such that the incoming bond is along the \u02c6xdirection. Thus\nli=li\u02c6xif atomriandri\u22121are directly bonded and has x- and y-components otherwise.\nWe now de\ufb01ne a rotation matrix that transforms from the coordina te system of unit i+1\nto uniti\nTi=\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8edcos\u03b8i sin\u03b8i 0\nsin\u03b8icos\u03c6i\u2212cos\u03b8icos\u03c6isin\u03c6i\nsin\u03b8isin\u03c6i\u2212cos\u03b8isin\u03c6i\u2212cos\u03c6i\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8. (11)\n14\nThe positions of the units in the frame of unit 1 are, thus, given by\nr(1)\n1=l1\nr(1)\n2=l1+T1l2\nr(1)\n3=l1+T1(l2+T2l3)\nr(1)\n4=l1+T1(l2+T2(l3+T3l4)). (12)\nWe further de\ufb01ne the matrix that converts from the frame of ref erence of unit 1 to the\nlaboratory reference frame\nTlab\n1= [cos\u03c8I+nn\u22a4(1\u2212cos\u03c8)+Msin\u03c8]A, (13)\nwhere\nM=\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed0\u2212nzny\nnz0\u2212nx\n\u2212nynx0\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8, (14)\nand\nn=\u02c6x\u00d7r\n|\u02c6x\u00d7r|\ncos\u03c8=r\u00b7\u02c6x\n|r|\nsin\u03c8=|r\u00d7\u02c6x|\n|r|, (15)\nwhere\u02c6xis a laboratory unit vector along the x direction, and ris the axis of the bond\ncoming into unit 1. The matrix Ais a rotation about \u02c6xand is de\ufb01ned so that Al1= \u2206r:\nA=\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed1 0 0\n0c\u2212s\n0s c\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8(16)\nwhere\nc= (l1y\u2206ry+l1z\u2206rz)/(\u2206r2\ny+\u2206r2\nz)\ns= (\u2212l1z\u2206ry+l1y\u2206rz)/(\u2206r2\ny+\u2206r2\nz). (17)\n15\nHere \u2206r=A[Tlab\n1]\u22121(r1\u2212r0) if unit 0 is a C unit; otherwise \u2206 r=l1.\nThe method proceeds by solving for \u03c6i,2\u2264i\u22646, analytically in terms of \u03c61. Then a\nnonlinear equation issolved numerically todetermine which values of \u03c61, if any, arepossible\nfor the chosen value of \u03c60.\nWe will work in the coordinate system of unit 1, after it has been rota ted by the chosen\n\u03c60. We de\ufb01ne\nt=r(1)\n5\u2212l1= [Tlab\n1]\u22121(r5\u2212r0)\u2212l1. (18)\nIf\u03b83\u221dnegationslash= 0 and\u03b85\u221dnegationslash= 0, the square distance between unit 3 and unit 5 is known and equal to\nq2\n1= (l4xcos\u03b84\u2212l4ysin\u03b84+l5x)2+(l4xsin\u03b84+l4ycos\u03b84+l5y)2. (19)\nBut this distance can also be written as\nq2\n1=|x\u2212T2l3|2\nx=T\u22121\n1t\u2212l2.

For\u03b83= 0,\u03b85= 0, the angle between\nr3\u2212r2andr6\u2212r5is known to be equal to \u03b84.\nTo determine \u03c63, two expressions for |r5\u2212r4|2are again equated to determine\nc2=l2\n5\u2212y2\u2212l2\n4+2yx(cos\u03b83l4x+sin\u03b83l4y)\n\u22122(sin\u03b83l4x\u2212cos\u03b83l4y)(y2y+y2z)1/2(24)\nand\n\u03c6I\n3= arcsinc2\u2212arctanyy/yz\u2212H(yz)\n\u03c6II\n3=\u03c0\u2212arcsinc2\u2212arctanyy/yz\u2212H(yz), (25)\nwherey=T\u22121\n2(T\u22121\n1t\u2212l2)\u2212l3.

This equation has between zero and four values for each value of \u03c61, however, due to\nthe multiple root character of Eqs. (21) and (25). Equation (30) is solved by searching the\nregion\u2212\u03c0 <\u03c6<\u03c0 for zero crossings. The search is in increments of \u22480.04\u25e6. These roots\nare then re\ufb01ned by a bisection method. There is always an even numb er of roots, due to\nthe periodic nature of Eq. 30.\nThe root positions, ri, are enough to determine the position andorientation of the seven\nrigid units that are modi\ufb01ed by the concerted rotation. Rigid unit 0 is t ranslated so that its\nroot position is at r0. It is oriented so that its incoming bond vector is along the outgoing\nbond vector of rigid unit \u22121. It is then rotated so that its outgoing bond vector ends at\nr1. This process is repeated sequentially for rigid units 1 to 6.\nRepeated application of the concerted rotation leads to a slightly imp erfect structure,\nduetonumericalprecisionerrors. Inapracticalapplication, theg eometrywouldberestored\nto an ideal state by application of the SHAKE [41] or Random Tweak alg orithm [42].\nThe transformation from \u03c6i,0\u2264i\u22646, to the new solution which is constrained to\nchange only ri,1\u2264i\u22644, actually implies a change in volume element in torsional angle\nspace. This change in volume element is the reason for the appearan ce of the Jacobian in\nthe acceptance probability. The Jacobian of the transformation f or alkanes is calculated\nin Ref. [22]. It is slightly di\ufb00erent here since root position r5is not necessarily the head\nposition. The Jacobian is given by\nJ= 1/|detB|, (31)\nwhere the 5 \u00d75 matrixBijis given by the ith component of uj\u00d7(r5\u2212hj) fori\u22643 and\nby the (i\u22123)th component of uj\u00d7(r6\u2212r5)/|r6\u2212r5|fori= 4,5.

This phenomenon poses an interes ting challenge\nto the theoriesof the origin oflife, since it preventsthe emergence of huge molecules\nwhich could carry the necessary information for building a complex me tabolism.\nMoreover, since modern theories of integration of information in pr e-biotic systems\ninvolve the compartmentation of a small number of molecules, the un derstanding of\nthe e\ufb00ects of the error propagation in \ufb01nite populations has becom e a major issue\nto the theories of the origin of life [3].\nThe quasispecies model was originally formulated within a deterministic chem-\nical kinetic framework based on a set of ordinary di\ufb00erential equat ions for the\nconcentrations of the di\ufb00erent types of molecules that compose t he population.\nSuch formulation, however, is valid only in the limit where the total num ber of\nmolecules, denoted by N, goes to in\ufb01nity. In the binary version of the quasispecies\nmodel, a molecule is represented by a string of Ldigits (s1,s2,...,s L), with the\nvariables s\u03b1allowed to take on only two di\ufb00erent values, say s\u03b1= 0,1, each of\nwhich representing a di\ufb00erent type of monomer used to build the mole cule.

In this context, the par ameterais\n2\ntermed selective advantage of the master string. As the replicatio n accuracy q\ndecreases, two distinct regimes are observed in the population com position in the\ndeterministic case: the quasispecies regime characterized by the presence of the\nmaster string together with its close neighbors, and the uniform regime where the\n2Lstrings appear in the same proportion. The transition between the se regimes\ntakes place at the error threshold qc, whose value depends on the parameters Land\na[1,2]. However,eveninthedeterministiccase, N\u2192 \u221e, agenuinethermodynamic\norder-disorder phase transition will occur in the limit L\u2192 \u221eonly [4, 5, 6]. To\nstudy this transition for large L, it is convenient to introduce the probability of\nexact replication of an entire string, namely,\nQ=qL, (5)\nso that the discontinuous transition occurs at\nQc=1\na(6)\nforL\u2192 \u221e[1, 6]. A recent \ufb01nite-size scaling study of the sharpness of the thr eshold\ntransition indicates that the characteristics of the transition per sist across a range\nofQof order L\u22121aboutQc[7].\nAlthough several theoretical frameworks have been proposed t o generalize the\ndeterministickineticformulationofthequasispeciesmodelsoastot akeintoaccount\nthee\ufb00ectof\ufb01nite N[8,9,10,11,12,13], thesomewhatuncontrolledapproximations\nusedinthoseanalyseshavehinderedaprecisecharacterizationof theerrorthreshold\nfor \ufb01nite populations. In particular, Nowak and Schuster [10] emplo yed a simple\nbirth and death model, whose deterministic limit, however, does not y ield the\nstationary distribution predicted by Eq. (1), as well as numerical s imulations based\non Gillespie\u2019s algorithm [14] to show that an appropriately de\ufb01ned Qc(N) tends\nto the deterministic value 1 /awithN\u22121/2for su\ufb03ciently large populations. A\nsimilar result was obtained by neglecting the possibility of occurrence of multiple\nerrors during the replication of a molecule [12]. A more drastic approx imation that\nneglects linkage disequilibrium at the population level yields that Qc(N) increases\nlinearly with 1 /N[13]. Of course, since there is no generally accepted de\ufb01nition\nof error threshold for \ufb01nite N(and for \ufb01nite Las well), denoted above by Qc(N),\nthere are some arbitrariness in those analyses.\nIn this paper we follow a more direct approach to characterize the e rror thresh-\nold transition for \ufb01nite N, which dispenses with a de\ufb01nition for Qc(N). As men-\ntioned before, since a genuine phase transition occurs in the limits N\u2192 \u221eand\nL\u2192 \u221eonly, we study a stochastic (i.e. \ufb01nite N) version of the quasispecies model\nwithL\u2192 \u221eandq\u21921 so that Q=qLis \ufb01nite. In this limit the problem\nsimpli\ufb01es enormously as the probability of any string becoming a maste r string\ndue to replication errors is of order 1 /Land so can be safely neglected. Besides,\nsince for the single-sharp-peak replication landscape the strings c an be classi\ufb01ed\nin two types only: the master strings and the error tail, which compr ises all other\n3\nstrings, the population at any given generation can be described by the single in-\ntegern= 0,1,...,N, which gives the number of master strings in the population.\nThe goal then is to calculate the probability distribution that at gene rationtthere\nare exactly nmaster strings in the population. This quantity, denoted by Pt(n),\nobeys the recursion equation\nPt+1(n) =N/summationdisplay\nm=0T(n,m)Pt(m) (7)\nwith the elements of the transition matrix Tgiven by\nT(n,m) =m/summationdisplay\nk=n/parenleftbigg\nN\nk/parenrightbigg /parenleftbigg\nk\nn/parenrightbigg\nwk\nm(1\u2212wm)N\u2212kQn(1\u2212Q)k\u2212n,(8)\nwhere\nwm=ma\nN\u2212m+ma(9)\nis the relative \ufb01tness of the master strings. In writing Eq. (8) we ha ve followed\nthe prescription used in the implementation of the standard genetic algorithm [15]:\n\ufb01rst the natural selection process acting via di\ufb00erential reprodu ction is considered\nand then the mutation process. We note that/summationtext\nnT(n,m) = 1\u2200mandT(0,0) = 1.\nMoreover the largest eigenvalue of Tis\u03bb0= 1 and its corresponding eigenvector\nisl\u2020\n0= (1,0,...,0). This stochastic model is easily recognized as the celebrated\nKimura-Crowin\ufb01niteallelemodel[16,17]whichhasbeenextensivelyst udiedwithin\nthe di\ufb00usion approximation for large N. However, for arbitrary values of Qanda\nthe solutions of the partial di\ufb00erential equations are too complicat ed to be of any\nutility to our purposes [17].\nAs for \ufb01nite Nthe \ufb02uctuations, either in the reproduction or mutation pro-\ncesses, will ultimately lead to the irreversible loss of all copies of the m aster string\nfrom the population, the asymptotic solution of Eq. (7) is simply P\u221e(n) =\u03b4n0.\nOur goal is to determine how the characteristic time, \u03c4, that governs the vanishing\nof the master strings from the population depends on N,Qanda.\nBefore proceeding on the analysis of the stochastic problem, it is ins tructive to\ndiscuss brie\ufb02y the deterministic limit N\u2192 \u221e. In this case the average number of\nmaster strings obeys the recursion equation\n/angbracketleftn/angbracketrightt+1=N/summationdisplay\nn=0N/summationdisplay\nm=0nT(n,m)Pt(m)\n=Qa/angbracketleftn/angbracketrightt, (10)\nwhose solution is /angbracketleftn/angbracketrightt= (Qa)t/angbracketleftn/angbracketright0. Hence, in the deterministic regime we \ufb01nd\n\u03c4=\u22121\nln(Qa)(11)\n4\nwhich diverges at Q=Qc= 1/a, signalling thus the existence of a phase transition\nin the limit N\u2192 \u221e. Clearly, for Q > Q cthe master strings are always present in\nthe population so that \u03c4is in\ufb01nite in this entire region.\nWe consider now the \ufb01nite Nregime. In this case the recursion equations for\nthe moments of ndo not yield useful information since, as usual, the moment of\norderpdepends on the moment of order p+1 evaluated at the previous generation.\nWe resort then to a direct calculation of the probability distribution Pt(m). More\nspeci\ufb01cally, we will focus on the calculation of Pt(0), since this is the quantity that\nmeasures the rate of vanishing of the master strings from the pop ulation. Although\nPt(0) could be evaluated through a series of matrix multiplications, a sim ple linear\nalgebra calculation yields [17]\nPt(0) =N/summationdisplay\nn=0cnln0\u03bbt\nn\n= 1+c1l10\u03bbt\n1+...+cNlN0\u03bbt\nN (12)\nwhere\u03bbnarethe eigenvaluesof T,ln0arethe zerothcomponentsofthe eigenvectors\nln, andcnare parametersthat depend on the initial state P0(n). Also we have used\n\u03bb0=l00=c0= 1. Assumingwithout lossofgeneralitythat1 \u2265\u03bb1\u2265...\u2265\u03bbN\u22650,\nin the limit of large twe \ufb01nd\n1\u2212Pt(0)\u2248Ce\u2212t/\u03c4(13)\nwhere\n\u03c4=\u22121\nln\u03bb1, (14)\nandCisaconstantthatdepends ontheinitial state. Thusthe problembe comesthe\none of \ufb01nding the second largest eigenvalue of the nonsymmetric ma trixT. Since\nthe largest eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector are alrea dy known, this\nnumerical problem yields easily to the vector iteration method [18]. Alt ernatively,\nwe could \ufb01nd \u03c4by following the time evolution of Pt(0), obtained directly through\nthe recursion equations (7), for a few generations and then plott ing ln[1\u2212Pt(0)]\nagainst the generation number t. We have veri\ufb01ed that both methods yield the\nsame results for \u03c4.\nInFig.1wepresentthedependenceofln \u03c4ontheprobabilityofexactreplication\nof an entire string, Q, fora= 2 and several values of N. The \ufb01nite Ne\ufb00ects are\nnegligible for values of Qsmaller than, though not too close, Qc, as indicated by\nthe very good agreement between the \ufb01nite Ndata and the theoretical prediction\nforN\u2192 \u221egiven in Eq. (11). Since we expect \u03c4to increase exponentially with\nincreasing NforQ > Q c, and to tend towards its limiting value, Eq. (11), also\nexponentially with NforQ < Q c, the issue is then to determine the dependence\nof\u03c4onNat the critical point Q=Qc. In Fig. 2 we present ln \u03c4calculated at\nQc= 1/aagainst ln Nfor di\ufb00erent values of a. These results indicate clearly that\nat the critical point \u03c4increases like N1/2, irrespective of the value of a. Once\n5\nwe have identi\ufb01ed the rescaling of ln \u03c4that leads to the collapsing of the data for\ndi\ufb00erent NatQ=Qc, the next step is to determine the sharpness of the transition,\nnamely, the range of QaboutQcwhere the transition characteristics persists. This\nis achieved by assuming that the size of this region shrinks to zero like N\u22121/\u03bdas\nN\u2192 \u221e, where the exponent \u03bd\u22650 is estimated using \ufb01nite-size scaling or, more\nprecisely, the data collapsing method [19]. In Fig. 3 we show the collaps e of the\ndata for di\ufb00erent Nobtained with \u03bd= 2 fora= 2, 10 and 50. Although for a= 2\nwe can achieve a good-quality data collapse using relatively small popu lation sizes\n(N\u2265200), for larger values of a, however, a similar quality collapsing can only\nbe obtained using larger values of N(i.e.N\u2265400). In summary, the results of\nthe data collapsing method indicate that the dependence of \u03c4onNin the critical\nregion is very well described by the scaling assumption\n\u03c4=N1/2fa/bracketleftBig\n(Q\u2212Qc)N1/2/bracketrightBig\n, (15)\nwherefais a scaling function, whose speci\ufb01c form depends on the parameter a.\nTo appreciate the e\ufb00ect of the selective advantage parameter aon the quality\nof the data collapsing results presented in Fig. 3, next we consider in some detail\nthe case a\u2192 \u221eandN\ufb01nite. Using wm\u21921 form >0 yields\nT(n,m) =T(n) =/parenleftbigg\nN\nn/parenrightbigg\nQn(1\u2212Q)N\u2212nm >0. (16)\nAs before, T(0,0) = 1 and T(n,0) = 0 for n >0. In this case the eigenvalues of T\ncan easily be calculated analytically yielding \u03bb0= 1,\u03bb1=/summationtextN\nn=1T(n),\u03bb2=...=\n\u03bbN= 0. Hence,\n\u03c4=\u22121\nln/bracketleftBig\n1\u2212(1\u2212Q)N/bracketrightBig. (17)\nFinally, taking the limits Q\u2192Qc= 0 and N\u2192 \u221e, we can easily verify that \u03bd= 1\nin this limit. This interesting result suggests that uncontrolled appro ximations\nand simpli\ufb01cations of the original model which enhance the selective a dvantage\nof the master string or the \ufb01nite population sampling e\ufb00ects are exp ected to give\nunreliable estimates of the exponent \u03bd. Moreover, care must be taken in restricting\nthe \ufb01nite-size scaling analysis to the regime N\u226bato avoid underestimating the\nvalue of \u03bd. We note, of course, that the situation of interest is N\u2192 \u221ewhilea\nremains \ufb01nite.\nTo conclude, the collapse of the data for di\ufb00erent Nintoa-dependent scaling\nfunctionspresentedinFig.3andsummarizedinthescalingassumptio n(15)provide\nafullcharacterizationoftheerrorthresholdtransition,signalled inourmodelbythe\ndivergence of \u03c4atQc= 1/a, for large N. We emphasize that the main advantageof\nour approachis that it does not relyupon any arbitraryde\ufb01nition of errorthreshold\nfor \ufb01nite populations.\n6\nAcknowledgments The work of JFF was supported in part by Conselho Na-\ncional de Desenvolvimento Cient\u00b4 \u0131\ufb01co e Tecnol\u00b4 ogico (CNPq).

We have here a simple physical situatio n (Fig. 1\n[2]), when the system volume Vbeing the sum ofvolumes ofall cells, the volume\nspeci\ufb01c energy and the interface speci\ufb01c energy Eare constant. The internal\nenergy of the system Eis completely de\ufb01ned by the cell interface area \u03a3. It is\neasytoseethat foranytwoneighbouringcellsthevolumedecrease ofthesmaller\none (down to complete disappearance) and the simultaneous volume increase of\nthe greater one diminish \u03a3. This permanent topological possibility to d ecrease\nE=E\u03a3 makes the system intrinsically unstable. The mean cell size increase s\nduring this statistical process (Fig. 1), named \u201dcoarsening\u201d(larg e cells \u201deat up\u201d\nsmall ones). The changes of Erelated to the elementary statistical event of cell\ndisappearance are so large in comparisonwith the energy of thermo \ufb02uctuations,\n\u2217E-mail: goryachev@univ-lille1.fr\n1\nFigure 1: Soap froth con\ufb01gurations at three di\ufb00erent times during its evolution.\nthat the coarsening cannot be described by ways of usual thermo dynamics [5].\nStill this challenging statistical problem can be elegantly solved by met hods of\nphysical kinetics, as shown by Lifshitz, Slyozov and Hillert (LSH) [6, 7 , 8], if we\nconsider the cellular structure as some dynamic system. To get a ce ll dynamics\nequation let us following LSH approximately consider each cell as an ela stic\nsphere shell embedded in an elastic environment which represents t he average\ne\ufb00ect of cell-cell interaction. For a cell of radius awe write an interface tension\nforce asF=\u2212E(1/a\u2212\u03ba), where the term 1 /ais related to the e\ufb00ect of interface\nsurface tension of the cell itself and the term \u03ba- to the e\ufb00ect of interface surface\ntension of adjoining cells (the elastic environment). The quantity \u03bais nothing\nthat a self-consistent mean of cell curvature throughout the sy stem. Believing\nthat the cell interface velocity wa\ufb00ected by Fis determined by viscous law\nw=MF, whereMis the cell interface mobility, we have [6, 7, 8]\nda/dt=\u2212D(1/a\u2212\u03ba) (1)\nwithD=ME. In the coarsening process the cells move in a size space {a}\n(some phase space) with a velocity (1). We can write a continuity equ ation in\nthis space as\n\u2202f/\u2202t+\u2202(fda/dt)/\u2202a= 0 (2)\nfor a cell size distribution function f(a,t) [6, 7, 8]. The function f(a,t) is\nnormalised so that n(t) =/integraltext\n0fdais the mean number of cells per unit volume;\n\u2126d/integraldisplay\n0adfda= 1; (3)\n\u00afa(t) =/integraltext\n0afda/nis the mean cell size and \u03c1(t) = \u03a3/V= (\u2126dd/2)/integraltext\n0ad\u22121fda\nis the mean cell interface density. Here d= 2,3 is the cellular structure dimen-\nsionality and \u2126 d= 2\u03c0(d\u22121)/d. Condition (3) is nothing that the conservation\nlaw of the total volume of all cells in unit volume. A remarkable propert y of\nthis statistical dynamic system, discovered by LSH, is the occurre nce of astable\nsteady-state regime ofevolution. This regimeis observedif and only if the mean\ncurvature\u03ba(t)taketheunique\u201dself-consistent\u201dvalue \u03ba(t) =/radicalbig\n2/(Dt). Allother\nmacroscopicsystem variables obey also simple scaling laws :\u00afa(t)\u221d\u03c1\u22121(t)\u221dt1/2,\nn(t)\u221dtd/2and the solution of (1)-(3) has a universal scaling form\nf0(a,t)\u221d(1/\u00afa(t))d+1\u03d5(\u00b51a/\u00afa(t)), (4)\nwhere\u03d5(z) is a peaked function, depending on donly, and\u00b51\u22481 [6, 7, 8].\n2\nThere is a great number of publications devoted to the question of \u201d improve-\nment\u201d of the individual cell dynamics equation (1) (we will say microsc opic dy-\nnamics equation) to get a good agreement of the cell size distributio nf0(a,t)\nwith experimental data, essentially in the metallurgic literature relat ed to nor-\nmal grain growth [2, 3, 4, 9, 10]. Surprisingly small attention has bee n paid to\nmesoscopic and macroscopic behaviours of the cellular structures as some con-\ntinuous elastic cellular medium with viscous motion law, although the exis tence\nof interesting self-organisation e\ufb00ects is almost evident here [11, 1 2]. Indeed, if\nwe have a good look at Fig. 1 we can see a strong size correlation of ad jacent\ncells. Near a small cell the probability to \ufb01nd another small cell is grat er then a\nlarge one, and vice versa, near a large cell the probability to \ufb01nd ano ther large\ncell is grater then a small one. In other words we observe here spa ce-correlated\n\ufb02uctuations of the mesoscopic cell interface density \u03c1(x,t). Qualitatively this\ne\ufb00ect can be easy analysed. Let us consider a nonhomogeneous ce llular struc-\nture with the macroscopic mean interface density \u03c1(t) and the mesoscopic one\n\u03c1(x,t) =\u03c1(t)+\u03b4\u03c1(x,t) , weakly varying in space. To be more precise, let us as-\nsume that\u03b4\u03c1(x,t)<<\u03c1(t) and the wavelength \u03bbof spatial variations of \u03c1(x,t)\nis much greaterthan \u00af a\u22481/\u03c1(t). Let us cut out a medium volume VLhaving the\nsizeL<<\u03bb, but still including many cells. Each element d sof the surface \u03a3 L,\nenclosingVL, is a\ufb00ected by the interface tension of the cells, surrounding VL.\nThe total interface tension force acting on VLis/contintegraltext\nE\u03c1ds=/integraltext\nE\u2207\u03c1dV. In a ho-\nmogeneous cell medium this force equals zero. In the nonhomogene ous medium\nthe force is non zero. The total cell interface in VL, which moves as the whole\nunder the force e\ufb00ect, is/integraltext\n\u03c1dV. Hence the force acting on cell interface unit is\nE\u2207\u03c1/\u03c1. Supposing the viscous law for the cell interface movement, we \ufb01nd a\ncell interface \ufb02ux j=\u03c1v\u221dD\u2207\u03c1. We see that the cells make a collective motion\nin the direction \u2207\u03c1. This is an uphill di\ufb00usion\u201d of the cell medium. Taking into\naccount the annihilation law d \u03c1/t\u221d \u2212D\u03c13, which follows from \u03c1(t)\u221dt\u22121/2, we\nget [12]\n\u2202\u03c1/\u2202t=\u2212\u03b31D\u03c13\u2212\u03b32D\u25b3\u03c1. (5)\nHere\u03b31and\u03b32are dimensionless constants, depending on the scaling distri-\nbution function \u03d5(z), only. Equation (5) has the form of a di\ufb00usion-reaction\nequation with the cell interface density \u03c1playing the role of concentration and\nwith a negative \u201ddi\ufb00usion\u201d coe\ufb03cient. We see that, the amplitude of a ny small\nspatial \ufb02uctuation \u03b4\u03c1(x,t) with wavelength \u03bb<\u03be, where\u03be= 2\u03c0/radicalbig\n\u03b32/3\u03b31\u03c1\u22121is\nthe correlation length of the \ufb02uctuations, grows without bound. I t follows that\ncompeting stochastic processes of cell disappearance and cell me dium \u201duphill\ndi\ufb00usion\u201d can give rise to the formation of large-scale domains of the size\u03bb\u2264\u03be\nhaving the density \u03c1(x,t) greater or smaller than the mean value \u03c1(t) (Fig. 2\n[13]). It also means that space derivatives of higher order of \u03c1must be taken\ninto account in right side of (5) for detailed analysis of the system st ability and\nmore accurate estimation of \u03be.\nWhereas the physical ideas explaining the possible macroscopic self- organi-\nsation e\ufb00ects are simple, the consecutive derivation of the mesosc opic evolution\nequation (5) and the calculation of kinetic coe\ufb03cients \u03b31and\u03b32, de\ufb01ning the\ne\ufb00ect quantitatively, turns out to be a di\ufb03cult statistical task [14]. Therefore\nthe \u201dtechnique\u201d of the problem solution asks for some commentarie s. Let us\nconsider an ideal gas as a well-known example for comparison. The co nsistent\ndescription of its evolution include three classic scale levels of conside ration:\n3\nFigure 2: Late-time con\ufb01gurations in Potts model of grain growth s imulation.\nmicro-, meso- and macroscopic [5, 6, 15, 16]. On the microscopic level the evo-\nlution is e\ufb00ectively described by methods of physical kinetics, i.e. by B oltzmann\nkinetic equation [5, 6] for the system probability distribution function fin a\nphase space, taking into account interaction and movement laws of atoms. Hav-\ning the equilibrium solution f0for the homogeneous gas (Maxwell-Boltzmann\n(MB) distribution), it is possible to move to the mesoscopic level of the system\ndescription by introducing mesoscopicquantities (density, pressu re, etc.) as mo-\nments of the distribution function. In the case of small spatial gra dients of the\nmesoscopic quantities, integration of kinetic equation by Enskog me thod gives a\nhydrodynamic equation [6, 15]. If the hydrodynamic equation has steady-state\nnonhomogeneoussolutions, it is possibleto talk abouta macroscopic description\nof the system by means of spatial patterns of size \u03bemuch greater than the meso-\nscopic size. To study the patterns formation it is convenient to tra nsform the\nhydrodynamic equation into Langevin stochastic equation [16] for an order pa-\nrameter. As we see above LSH distribution (4) plays the same outstanding ro le\nfor the coarsening cellular structures in steady-state, as MB dist ribution plays\nfor ideal gases in equilibrium state [5, 6, 7, 8]. All di\ufb00erence between M B and\nLSH distributions is that the \ufb01rst is determined by thermo\ufb02uctuatio ns related\nto collisions of gas atoms and the second is determined by stochasto \ufb02uctuations\nrelated to the process of cells annihilation. Hence the main methodica l idea of\nthis paper is to use LSH distribution as a basis for the multilevel descr iption of\ncellular structure, like MB distribution is used in order to go from the k inetic\nequation to the hydrodynamic one and then to the stochastic one. This idea\nhas interesting applications for other physical systems, where th e scaling regime\nis reached. For example, its application allows to generalise Lifshitz-S lyozov\ntheory of homogeneous coalescence [7] for the nonhomogeneous case [17], to de-\nscribe the relaxation of nonhomogeneous dislocation structure du ring annealing\n[12] etc.\n4\n2 Kinetic theory (microscopic level)\nLet us consider as in Sec. 1 a nonhomogeneous cellular structure wit h the in-\nterface density \u03c1(x,t), weakly varying in space. We divide the volume Vof the\nsystem into small coarse-graining elements VLwithL << \u03bb, but still includ-\ning many cells. In the \ufb01rst approximation the cell dynamics of the str ucture\nin eachVLwill be de\ufb01ned by the dynamics equation (1), with the curvature \u03ba\nbecoming a local caracteristic - an interface curvature self-consistent mean \ufb01eld\n\u03ba(x,t) . The \ufb01eld \u03ba(x,t) inVLat point xequals to the self-consistent mean\nof cell curvature \u03ba(t) determined by (1)-(4) for the cell structure in VLif we\napproximately consider it as homogeneous. The \ufb01eld \u03ba(x,t) is a weakly varying\nfunction in space as \u03c1(x,t) is. In the second approximation the dynamics equa-\ntion (1) will contain gradients of the \ufb01eld \u03ba(x,t). It is easy to establish this fact\nif weanalyzean one-dimensionalcellularstructure( d= 1). Let us cell interfaces\nare located at the points xi(i= 0,\u00b11,\u00b12,...) ofx-axe. We have the cell radii\na(i)= (xi+1\u2212xi)/2 , the cell curvatures \u03ba(i)= 1/a(i)and the cell centres coordi-\nnatesx(i)= (xi+1+xi)/2. Eachinterfaceisacted uponby attractionofadjacent\nones(the interfacetension ofthe cells) accordingtothe law Fi=E(\u03ba(i)\u2212\u03ba(i\u22121))\nwith the result that the cell changes its position dx(i)/dt=D(\u03ba(i+1)\u2212\u03ba(i\u22121))/2\nand its size da(i)/dt=D(\u03ba(i+1)+\u03ba(i\u22121)\u22122\u03ba(i))/2. If we now introduce a cur-\nvature exact \ufb01eld \u03bae(x,t) as a step function, which is \u03ba(i)ifxi<x<x i+1, we\ncan rewrite dx(i)/dt=D[\u03bae(x(i)\u2212a(i),t)\u2212\u03bae(x(i)+a(i),t)]/2 andda(i)/dt=\nD[\u03bae(x(i)+a(i),t)+\u03bae(x(i)\u2212a(i),t)\u22122/a(i)]/2. Replacing the exact \ufb01eld \u03bae(x,t)\nby the mean \ufb01eld \u03ba(x,t) and taking into account that \u00af a << L << \u03bb we get\nrespectively the cell velocity and the cell size change rate\ndx/dt=Da\u2207\u03ba/d, (6)\nda/dt=\u2212D(1/a\u2212\u03ba)+Da2\u25b3\u03ba/(2d). (7)\nIt is easy to understand that the abovementioned de\ufb01nition of the curvature\nmean \ufb01eld\u03bae(x,t) holds for nonhomogeneous cellular structures in two ( d= 2)\nand three dimensions ( d= 3). Expressions (6) and (7) are also valid. Really,\neach cell of the structure may be approximatelythought of as hav ingthe form of\nsphere. Then the all cellular structure con\ufb01guration may be descr ibed through\nthe cell centrecoordinatesand the cell radii. Letus chooseacell o fradiusawith\ncentre in a point xand an interface point with coordinate x\u2032=x+a(x\u2032,t) of the\ncell. The velocity w(x\u2032,t) of the interface point a\ufb00ected by the interface tension\nforceF(x\u2032,t) =\u2212E[1/a(t)\u2212\u03bae(x\u2032,t)]a(x\u2032,t)/a(t), is determined by the viscous\nlaww(x\u2032,t) =MF(x\u2032,t)]. Replacing \u03bae(x,t) by\u03ba(x,t) we can approximately\ncalculate the cell velocity d x/dt=/contintegraltext\nw(x\u2032,t)ds\u2032/(\u2126ddad\u22121)\u2248a\u2207w/dand the\ncell size change rate d a/dt=/contintegraltext\nw(x\u2032,t)ds\u2032/(\u2126ddad\u22121)\u2248w+a2\u25b3w/(2d) and\n\ufb01nd expresions (6) and (7).\nWe see that the cells move in a coordinate-size space {x,a}in the process\nof coarsening. These movements are conveniently described by kin etic equation\n[18]\n\u2202f/\u2202t+\u2202(fdx/dt)/\u2202x+\u2202(fda/dt)/\u2202a= 0 (8)\nfor the structure probability distribution function f(x,a,t) in the cell coordi-\nnate-size space with normalisation condition\n(\u2126d/V)/integraldisplay\ndx/integraldisplay\n0daadf= 1. (9)\n5\nEquations (8) and (9) have the physical sense of continuity equat ion in the\ncoordinate-size space and of conservation law of the total volume of all cells of\nthe system. They are natural generalisations of (2) and (3). For the macroscop-\nically homogeneous cell structure the set of equations (6)-(9) co mes to (1)-(3)\nand has the solution (4) with \u03d5(z) = [dz/(2\u2212z)d+2](2e)dexp[2d/(z\u22122)] for\n0< z <2 and\u03d5(z) = 0 forz\u22652 ;\u00b5i=/integraltext\n0zi\u03d5(z)dz. The mean structure\nvariables obey simple scaling laws: \u00af a(t) =\u00b51\u221a\nDt;\u03ba(t) = (\u00b5d\u22122/\u00b5d\u22121)/\u221a\nDt;\nn(t) = 1/(\u2126d\u00b5d(\u221a\nDt)d) and\u03c1(t) =d\u00b5d\u22121/(2\u00b5d\u221a\nDt).\nTo \ufb01ndf1(x,a,t) =f0(a,t)+\u03b4f(x,a,t) in the \ufb01rst-order approximation for\nsmall parameters | \u2207\u03c1|/\u03c12<<1, it is necessary, as in well-known Enskog\nmethod [6], to substitute f1(x,a,t) in (6)-(9) and linearize them, taking into\naccount that \u03b4f(x,a,t)<< f0(a,t). I hope in a future work to realise this\npossibility, but this is proving at present to be a di\ufb03cult task [14].\n3 Hydrodynamic theory (mesoscopic level)\nEquation (8) provides the kinetic (microscopic) description of the c ellular struc-\nture coarsening. To get the hydrodynamic equation let us rewrite ( 4) as\nf0(a,t) =\u03b1\u03c1d+1\u03d5(\u03b2a\u03c1), (10)\nwhere\u03b1= (\u00b5d)d/[\u2126d(d\u00b5d\u22121)d+1] and\u03b2=\u00b5d/(d\u00b5d\u22121) are constants, and use\nagain as in Sec. 1 and 2 the standard coarse-grain averaging proce dure [1].\nNamely, let us introduce a mesoscopic coarse-graining length L(t)>>\u00afa(t),\nso that a mesoscopic coarse-graining volume VL= \u2126dLdincludes many cells.\nLet us divide the volume Vof cellular structure into elements of volume VL.\nFor small gradients of mesoscopic variables \u03ba(x,t),\u00afa(x,t),\u03c1(x,t),andn(x,t) we\nmay suppose that a local homogeneous steady-state is reached in each separate\nelementVLafter a time \u03c4L=L2/Dmuch greater than the cell annihilation time\n\u03c4a= \u00afa2/D. For all this, the cellular structure as the whole (macroscopically)\nis not in the homogeneous state. Then the distribution function f0(x,a,t) in\nVLat point xcan be assumed to be a local steady-state function , equal to LSH\ndistribution (10) for the homogeneous cellular structure with dens ity\u03c1(x,t),\nthat prevails at the point x. This supposition is completely analogous to the\nlocal system equilibrium one inlinear thermodynamics [5, 6]. Multiplying (8) by\n\u2126ddad\u22121/2, (6) by \u2126 ddad\u22121f0/2, (8) by \u2126 dad, integrating them by aand using\nconservation law (9), we make the averaging procedure. After su \ufb03ciently heavy\ncalculations we obtain, respectively, the equation of cell medium continuity , an\nanalogue of Darcy\u2019s law in hydrodynamics and an equation similar to the state\nequation in gas dynamics [15]:\n\u2202\u03c1/\u2202t+\u2207(\u03c1v) =\u2212D[\u03b11\u03c13\u2212\u03b12\u03c12\u03ba\u2212\u03b13\u25b3\u03ba], (11)\nv= (D/2)\u03c1\u22121\u2207\u03ba, (12)\n\u03c13\u03ba=\u03b21\u03c14\u2212\u03b22\u03c1\u25b3\u03ba+\u03b23\u2207\u03ba\u2207\u03c1. (13)\nThe set of three hydrodynamic equations (11)-(13), containing t hree hydrody-\nnamic quantities of the cell medium: the density \u03c1(x,t) , the velocity v(x,t) =\n(\u2126dd/\u03c1)/integraltext\n0ad\u22121(dx/dt)fda, and the curvature \u03ba(x,t), forms a closed set. The\nrole of the quantities \u03c1(x,t) ,\u03ba(x,t) andv(x,t) are completely analogous to the\n6\nrole of gas density, pressure and velocity in viscous gas dynamics. I f initial and\nboundary conditions are known, the cell medium movement can be de termined\nby traditional hydro-gas dynamics methods [15] for any continuou s distribution\nof\u03c1(x,t) ,\u03ba(x,t) andv(x,t). By substituting (12)-(13) in (11), the set can be\nreduced to evolution equation (5). In (5), (11)-(13) \u03b11,\u03b12,\u03b21,\u03b22,\u03b31,\u03b32are cal-\nculated constants. For d= 2:\u03b11= 1.54,\u03b12= 1.11,\u03b13= 0.25, \u03b21= 1.11,\u03b22=\n0,\u03b23= 0.267,\u03b31= 0.308,\u03b32= 0.277.

Full expressions are\nsu\ufb03ciently bulky (e.g. \u03b11= 4(d\u22121)\u00b52\nd\u00b5d\u22123/(d2\u00b53\nd\u22121)) and will be published\nelsewhere [14].\n4 Stochastodynamic theory (macroscopic level)\nTo analyse the dynamics of macroscopic spatial perturbations of t he cell me-\ndium, let us introduce a relative value of deviation of the cell interfac e density\nfrom its mean macroscopic value \u03c8(x,t) =\u03b4\u03c1(x,t)/\u03c1(t)<<1 , where\u03c1(t) is\nthe uniform solution of (5). Substituting \u03c1(x,t) =\u03c1(t) +\u03b4\u03c1(x,t) in (5) and\ncoming to new time and space variables \u2202\u02dct= 3\u03b31D\u03c12(t)\u2202t=\u2212\u2202ln\u03c13(t) and\n\u2202\u02dcx=\u03c1(t)\u2202x(intrinsic system variables [7]), we obtain\n\u2202\u03c8/\u2202\u02dct=\u2212\u03b4F/\u03b4\u03c8 (14)\nwithF{\u03c8}=/integraltext\nd\u02dcx[A\u03c82+C(\u02dc\u2207\u03c8)2]/2 ,A= 1 and C=\u2212\u03b32/(3\u03b31) (C=\u22120.300\nford= 2 and C=\u22120.351 ford= 3 ). Taking \u03c8(\u02dcx,\u02dct) in the form \u03c8(\u02dcx,\u02dct) =\n\u03c8(\u02dck,\u02dc\u03c9)ei(\u02dck\u02dcx\u2212\u02dct\u02dc\u03c9), we get the dispersion relation \u02dc \u03c9(\u02dck) =\u2212i\u02dc\u03c3(\u02dck) , where\n\u02dc\u03c3(\u02dck) =A+C\u02dck2(15)\nisthedampingcoe\ufb03cient. Includingin F{\u03c8}the term \u2212h\u03c8describingthee\ufb00ect\nof an external \ufb01eld h(\u02dcx,\u02dct)\u221dei(\u02dck\u02dcx\u2212\u02dct\u02dc\u03c9), we \ufb01nd the generalised susceptibility\n\u02dc\u03c7(\u02dck,\u02dc\u03c9) = 1/[\u02dc\u03c3(\u02dck)\u2212i\u02dc\u03c9].\nAs all mesoscopic quantities, \u03c8is a \ufb02uctuating quantity. But on writing\n(14) we have neglected these \ufb02uctuations. The quantity \u03c8is a sum of a number\nof microscopic random quantities. Each of them corresponds to th e contri-\nbution of a cell being in VL. In view of central limit theorem of statistics,\n\u03c8has Gaussian distribution function with the mean value < \u03c8 > L= 0 and\nthe dispersion < \u03c82>L=\u03bd/[VLN] , where\u03bd=\u00b52(d\u22121)/\u00b52\nd\u22121\u22121 (\u03bd= 0.109\nford= 2 and\u03bd= 0.373 ford= 3) [14]. Equation (14), after taking into\naccount the \ufb02uctuations, becomes Langevin stochastic equation withF{\u03c8}\nbeing astochastodynamic potential [19]. The noise \u03b6is Gaussian noise, with\n<\u03b6 >= 0 and the correlation function <\u03b6(\u02dcx,\u02dct)\u03b6(\u02dcx\u2032,\u02dct\u2032)>= 2\u03b8\u03b4(\u02dcx\u2212\u02dcx\u2032)\u03b4(\u02dct\u2212\u02dct\u2032)\n, de\ufb01ned by the \ufb02uctuations at scales a << L and\u03c4a<< \u03c4L. Here\u03b8=\n\u2126d(d/2)d\u22121(\u00b5d\nd\u22121/\u00b5d\u22121\nd)(\u00b52(d\u22121)/\u00b52\nd\u22121\u22121) (\u03b8= 0.619ford= 2 and\u03b8= 8.09 for\nd= 3 ) [14]. The forms of evolution equation (14) and of the noise \u03b6guarantee\nthat the steady-state probability distribution functional is given b y Boltzmann\nformulaP{\u03c8} \u221dexp[\u2212F{\u03c8}/\u03b8] [19]. We see that our cell system is rated in\nthe class of so-called potential systems with potential F{\u03c8}having Landau-\nGinzburg form [5, 6, 16] and the quantity \u03c8plays a role of an order parameter .\nIt is not surprizing because in general sense the system is in perfec t analogy to\na thermodynamic system with a nonconserved order parameter \u03c8. So the forms\n7\nof evolution equation (14) and of potential F{\u03c8}are dictated by simple symme-\ntry macroscopic considerations. Instead of the thermal noise in t hermodynamic\nsystems we have here the stochastic noise, created by the contin uous process of\ncells annihilation. In virtue of reasoning, \ufb02uctuation-dissipation the orem may\nbe applied, according to which the generalised susceptibility \u02dc \u03c7(\u02dck,\u02dc\u03c9) determines\nthe spectral correlation function of \ufb02uctuations as \u02dcS(\u02dck,\u02dc\u03c9) = (2\u03b8/\u02dc\u03c9)Im\u02dc\u03c7(\u02dck,\u02dc\u03c9) .\nThe structure function has usual Ornstein-Zernike form \u02dcS(\u02dck) =\u03b8/\u02dc\u03c3(\u02dck) [5, 6].\nFrom (15) we see, that the order parameter modes \u03c8(\u02dck,\u02dct) with\u02dck>/radicalbig\n\u2212A/C\nare unstable. This is every indication that highest order terms of th e expan-\nsion ofF{\u03c8}in powers of \u02dc\u2207\u03c8must be considered for detailed analysis of the\nsystem stability. The derivation of the exact expression for these terms by\nEnskog method is a very heavy task [6, 14] not realized to the prese nt. We\nproceed now di\ufb00erently. Let us use the fact that our system is pot ential with\nthe nonconserved order parameter \u03c8. Then we may consider F{\u03c8}as some\nphenomenological potential in the abovemensioned Landau sense. This poten-\ntial have necessarily the general form F{\u03c8}=/integraltext\ndx[A\u03c82+C(\u02dc\u2207\u03c8)2+D(\u02dc\u25b3\u03c8)2]/2\nwithD>0 [5, 16, 20]. The phenomenological coe\ufb03cients A,CandDcan be\nfound from experiments, computer simulations or by a direct calcula tion as we\nhave made above for AandC. As a consequence we get the damping coe\ufb03cient\nin the form\n\u02dc\u03c3(\u02dck) =A+C\u02dck2+D\u02dck4. (16)\nWe do not know the real value of D, but we are able to forecast the possible\nscenarios of system evolution [20]. If A>0,C<0 andD>C2/(4A) the\nevolution equation (14) has the single stable solution \u03c80(\u02dcx) = 0 , and modes\n\u03c8(\u02dck,\u02dct) with any \u02dckdecay with time. Therefore the system is stable with respect\nto large-scale \ufb02uctuations of \u03c8(\u02dcx,\u02dct) near\u03c80(\u02dcx) = 0 . The modes \u03c8(\u02dck,\u02dct) with\n\u02dck=\u02dckC=/radicalbig\n\u2212C/(2D) = 2\u03c0/\u02dc\u03be, where\u02dc\u03beis an intrinsic correlation length, have\nthe lowest decay rate. That is why under the action of the stochas tic internal\nnoise\u03b6, created by a continuous process of cells annihilation, space-corr elated\n\ufb02uctuations arise in the system. The system is in a modulated state (short range\nordering) and the structure function\n\u02dcS(\u02dck) =\u03b8/(A+C\u02dck2+D\u02dck4). (17)\nhas a maximum at \u02dck=\u02dckC(Fig. 3), re\ufb02ecting the abovestated fact that the\nmodes\u03c8(\u02dckC,\u02dct)decaywiththelowestrate. If A>0,C<0and0<D<C2/(4A)\n, the evolution equation (14) has the unstable solution \u03c80(\u02dcx) = 0 and stationary\none-, two-, ... d-dimensional space-periodical solutions with wavelength \u02dc\u03bb=\u02dc\u03be\n[20]. Under the action of the stochastic internal noise \u03b6the system comes from\nthe homogeneous state into one of these patterned state (long range ordering).\nThe question of existence of the \ufb01rst or of the second type of ord ering depends\nof the value of coe\ufb03cient D.\n5 Discussion\nWe see that in the process of structure coarsening the macrosco pic cell interface\ndensity\u03c1(t) decreases with time as \u03c1(t)\u221dt\u22121/2and the mesoscopic density\n\u03c1(x,t) =\u03c1(t)[1+\u03b4\u03c1(x,t)/\u03c1(t)] also decreases (Fig. 1). The competition of two\nstochastic processes of the cells annihilation and of the cells collectiv e motion\n8\n\u00c4S(\u00c4k)/\u00c4S(0)\n\u00c4k  D=0.1\n  D=1  D=0.2\nFigure3: Scaledstructurefunctionof\ufb02uctuations \u02dcS(\u02dck)/\u02dcS(0) = 1/[1+(C/A)\u02dck2+\n(D/A)\u02dck4] of the relative interface density \u03c8(x,t) =\u03c1(x,t)/\u03c1(t)\u22121 for di\ufb00erent\nD.\ncreates space-correlated \ufb02uctuations of the cell interface den sity. These \ufb02uctua-\ntions are the adjacent domains of size \u03bewith\u03c1(x,t) greater or smaller than \u03c1(t)\n(Fig. 1,2). In other words, they are the domains in which the cells hav e the\nmean size \u00afa(x,t) greater or smaller than the macroscopic mean value \u00af a(t) . The\namplitude of relative \ufb02uctuations \u03b4\u03c1(x,t)/\u03c1(t) and the domain size (characteris-\ntic wavelength of \ufb02uctuations), divided by the mean cell size \u03be/\u00afa(t)\u221d\u03be\u03c1(t) =\u02dc\u03be\nstay constant. These domains can be short-range ordered (Fig. 1) or long-range\n(Fig. 2) ordered in space. The short-range ordering of cell interf ace density\n\ufb02uctuations resemble the \ufb02uid density \ufb02uctuations ordering in the w ell-known\nphenomenon of critical opalescence. The long-range ordering of c ell interface\ndensity \ufb02uctuations resemble to the e\ufb00ect of spinodal decomposit ion in thermo-\ndynamic systems.\nThis is just a moment to return to the question discussed in Sec. 1 an d\n2 about basing of the self-consistent mean \ufb01eld approximation for d escription\nof the cellular systems. The condition of its validity is the condition tha t the\nrelativevalueof\ufb01eld\ufb02uctuations \u03b4\u03ba(x,t)/\u03ba(t)\u2248\u03b4\u03c1(x,t)/\u03c1(t)\u2248\u03c8(x,t) issmall.\nMore priscisely, the \ufb02uctuations averaged over the coarse-grain ing volume VL\nmust be small: < \u03c82(x,t)>L=\u03bd/[VLN(x,t)]<<1 . Choosing the volume\nof a \ufb01rst coordination sphere as a minimum possible value of VLand taking\ninto consideration that n=VLNis the number of cells in VL, we see that\nthis condition is well satis\ufb01ed both for d= 2(\u03bd= 0.109,n\u22487) andd=\n3(\u03bd= 0.373,n\u224813). The general condition of validity of mean-\ufb01eld theory\nfor the systems with Landau-Ginzburg potential F{\u03c8}is well-known Ginzburg\ncriterion: \ufb02uctuations of \u03c8averaged over the correlation volume must be small\n< \u03c82(x,t)>\u03be=\u03bd/[V\u03beN(x,t)]<<1 . This criterion is obviously ful\ufb01lled if\nL\u2264\u03be. Uniting this condition with the foregoing condition of existence of\nstochastodynamic potential F{\u03c8}, we have \ufb01nally \u00af a << L \u2264\u03be. This is just\nthe familiar condition of the choice of the coarse graining size L, which is also\n9\nthe condition of validity of the self-consistent mean \ufb01eld approximat ionin phase\ntransformation theory. It can be satis\ufb01ed if \u00af a<<L\u2264\u03be. In coarsening cellular\nsystems this is always the case for the short range ordering ( D>C2/(4A))\nand this is so indeed if D>>\u2212C/(8\u03c02) for the long-range ordering (0 <D<\nC2/(4A) ).\nIn spite of that the ordering e\ufb00ects of cell interface density \ufb02uct uations\ncan be evidently established by visual analysis of di\ufb00erent cellular str uctures\nin experiments (Fig. 1) and computer simulations (Fig. 2), I am not aw are\nof publications, where the structure function (17), describing th e e\ufb00ect quan-\ntitatively, has been directly obtained. I feel that it is related to two reasons.\nFirstly, it must be noted that hydrodynamic and stochastodynamic theories de-\nveloped here are valid in the long wavelength limit \u02dck=k\u03c1(t)<1 , when we can\nguarantee the possibility of application of the cell medium conception and the\nself-consistent mean \ufb01eld approximation. In the long wavelength limit \u02dck<1 the\nmaximum of \u02dcS(\u02dck) is hardly observed: if \u02dckC<<1 the maximum is small (Fig.\n3); if\u02dckC\u22481 it is hardly separated from the other maximum \u02dck0\u22482 correspond-\ning to the trivial e\ufb00ect that the mean distance between neighbourin g interfaces\nis 2\u00afa. This later maximum cannot be described within our long wavelength\napproach and is not shown in Fig. 3. Therefore the more strong con \ufb01rmation\nof existence of the large-scale \ufb02uctuations of cell interface dens ity is the obser-\nvation of the negative curvature of\u02dcS(\u02dck) in the macroscopic \u02dck\u21920 limit (Fig.\n3). However it demands of a laborious statistical analysis or a scatt ering study\nof very large cellular systems. In actual practice the \ufb01nite-size ind uced e\ufb00ects\nstays too essential [21]. Secondly, in computer experiments, using usually \u201d\nq- states Potts model\u201d [10, 13], the structure function S(k) is calculated as a\nFourier transform of the correlation function of a phases volume d ensity. If all\nphases have the same equilibrium energy, and the boundaries separ ating the\nphase domains, are su\ufb03ciently distinct, the system state is complet ely de\ufb01ned\nby the total interfacial area. In consequence, the cell interfac e density\u03c1(x,t)\nand the corresponding structure function (17) is a much more sen sible charac-\nteristic of the system than the phases volume density and the corr esponding to\nit structure function. Quite recently [22] it has been demonstrate d by computer\nsimulation of normal grain growth that a size correlation between ne ighbouring\ngrains exist in grain structure. Unfortunately the spectral corr elation analy-\nsis of the cell interface density \ufb02uctuations by means of the struc ture function\n(17) has not been made and direct quantitative comparison of thes e results with\npresent theoryresults is di\ufb03cult. Still there is no doubt that we are dealing with\nthe \ufb01rst observation of the short-range ordering of cell interfa ce density \ufb02uctu-\nations in cellular structures. New experiments or computer simulatio ns with\ncareful space spectral analysis of cell interface density \ufb02uctua tions are needed\nto con\ufb01rm the existence of dynamic patterning in cellular structure s.\n6 Summary\nIn summary, the problems of multilevel description of cellular struct ure evolu-\ntion are considered from positions of kinetic, hydrodynamic and sto chastody-\nnamic theories of nonequilibrium statistical systems. It is demonstr ated that\nthe e\ufb00ective method to solve the problem is to describe the cellular st ructure on\nthe microscopic level by the probability distribution function in the co ordinate-\n10\nsize space, i.e. in the space of the cell coordinates and the cell sizes . The\nkinetic equation for the weakly nonhomogeneous cellular structure is written\nand the development to hydrodynamic equations for a continuous e lastic cellu-\nlar medium with viscous motion law is realised. These non-linear di\ufb00erent ial\nequations contain three mesoscopic quantities of the cell medium (t he cell inter-\nface density, the cell medium velocity and the cell interface curvat ure) and are\nanalogous to the continuity equation, Darcy\u2019s law and the equation o f state in\ngas dynamics. For continuous \ufb02ow of the cell medium the hydrodyna mic equa-\ntion set is reduced to a single evolution equation for the cell interfac e density.\nIt has the form of a di\ufb00usion-reaction equation with a negative \u201ddi\ufb00u sion\u201d co-\ne\ufb03cient and with the cell interface density playing the role of \u201dconce ntration\u201d.\nIt is shown that the relative value of deviation of the cell interface d ensity from\nits mean macroscopic value is a suitable order parameter of the syst em. The\norder parameter dynamics are described by Langevin stochastic e quation with a\nstochastodynamic potential having Ginzburg-Landau form and wit h a stochas-\ntic noise, created by the continuous process of cells annihilation. An alysis of\nthe order parameter dynamics in coarsening reveals a new e\ufb00ect of macroscopic\npatterning in the cell medium: competition between two stochastic p rocesses of\nthe small cells \u201deating up\u201d by large ones and of the \u201duphill cells di\ufb00usion \u201d leads\nto the creation of space-correlated \ufb02uctuations of the cell inter face density.\n7 Acknowledgements\nI alwayskeep in my memory stimulating discussions with the late B.

PELETIER, HANS V. WESTERHOFF, AND BORIS N. KHOLODENK O\nAbstract. A hallmark of a plethora of intracellular signaling pathway s is the\nspatial separation of activation and deactivation process es that potentially re-\nsults in precipitous gradients of activated proteins. The c lassical Metabolic\nControl Analysis (MCA), which quanti\ufb01es the in\ufb02uence of an i ndividual pro-\ncess on a system variable as the control coe\ufb03cient, cannot be applied to spa-\ntially separated protein networks. The present paper unrav els the principles\nthat govern the control over the \ufb02uxes and intermediate conc entrations in spa-\ntially heterogeneous reaction networks. Our main results a re two types of the\ncontrol summation theorems. The \ufb01rst type is a non-trivial g eneralization of\nthe classical theorems to systems with spatially and tempor ally varying con-\ncentrations. In this generalization, the process of di\ufb00usi on, which enters as the\nresult of spatial concentration gradients, plays a role sim ilar to other processes\nsuch as chemical reactions and membrane transport. The seco nd summation\ntheorem is completely novel. It states that the control by th e membrane trans-\nport, the di\ufb00usion control coe\ufb03cient multiplied by two, and a newly introduced\ncontrol coe\ufb03cient associated with changes in the spatial si ze of a system (e.g.,\ncell), all add up to one and zero for the control over \ufb02ux and co ncentration.\nUsing a simple example of a kinase/phosphatase system in a sp herical cell, we\nspeculate that unless active mechanisms of intracellular t ransport are involved,\nthe threshold cell size is limited by the di\ufb00usion control, w hen it is beginning\nto exceed the spatial control coe\ufb03cient signi\ufb01cantly.\n1.Introduction\nExtracellular information received by plasma membrane receptors is processed,\nencoded, and transferred to the nucleus through activation and spatial relocation of\nmultiple signalling components. Receptor activation triggers signalling responses\nassociated with the mobilization of a plethora of adapter and target proteins to\nthe plasma membrane (Haugh and Lau\ufb00enburger 1997; Kholodenko et al. 2000b).\nProteins activated e.g. by phosphorylation at the cell surface tra vel to stimulate\ncritical regulatory targets at various cellular sites including the nuc leus. During\nand after the travel, these proteins are inactivated, e.g. throug h dephosphorylation.\nFor instance, a protein phosphorylated by a plasma-membrane ass ociated protein\nkinase can be dephosphorylated by a phosphatase in the cytosol o r nucleus. The\ntransport between cellular locations, where the activation and inac tivation occur,\nis passive (thermal di\ufb00usion), driven by spatial gradients in the con centrations.\nIn some cases, not to be discussed here, motor proteins or endoc ytosis may be\ninvolved (Kholodenko 2002). Previous work estimated that these s patial gradients\nCentrum voor Wiskunde en Informatica, Amsterdam, The Nethe rlands;peletier@cwi.nl\nVrije Universiteit Amsterdam, The Netherlands; hw@bio.vu.nl\nThomas Je\ufb00erson University, Philadelphia, USA; Boris.Kholodenko@mail.tju.ed .\n1\n2 MARK A.

KHOLODEN KO\nmay be large, and that therefore di\ufb00usion may contribute to the co ntrol of signal\ntransduction (Brown and Kholodenko 1999; Kholodenko et al. 2000 a).\nFor spatially homogeneous reaction networks, the control over \ufb02 uxes and in-\ntermediate concentrations has been studied both experimentally a nd theoretically\n(reviewed in (Fell 1997)). The control is generally quanti\ufb01ed as the extent to which\nany type of molecular process in\ufb02uences a system variable, such as the \ufb02ux or\nconcentration. The control coe\ufb03cients are de\ufb01ned as the ratios of the fractional\nchanges in the system variable to that of the biochemical activity wh ich caused the\nsystem change. Mathematically, the stability of a system steady st ate is required\nand the changes are considered as in\ufb01nitesimally small, i.e., the coe\ufb03cie nts are ex-\npressedasthe logtologderivatives(Fell 1997). Importantprincip lesunderlyingthe\ncontrol of biochemical reaction networks in well-stirred reactors have been worked\nout recently. For instance, it can be shown that a large increase in t he activity of\na single enzyme does not result in a substantial increase in the \ufb02ux fo r almost any\nmetabolic network; marked \ufb02ux increase can be achieved by a conce rted modula-\ntion of several pathway reactions (Kacser and Acerenza 1993). In metabolic control\nanalysis (MCA), this result is related to the so-called summation theo rem, which\nstates that the sum of the enzyme control coe\ufb03cients adds up to 1 (Kacser and\nBurns 1973; Heinrich and Rapoport 1973; Westerho\ufb00 and van Dam 1 987). There\nis no rate-limiting enzyme, the control is shared between all networ k processes.\nThe present paper unravels the principles that govern the contro l pattern in spa-\ntially heterogeneous cellular networks. We demonstrate new prope rties of control\nthatresultfromthespatialaspectofdi\ufb00usionandseparationofs ignallingreactions.\nThe control summation theorems, relevant for these networks, are formulated and\nproven.\n2.Methods\n2.1.Description of the system.

For thermodyn amic reasons,\nliving systems need to be open for at least some chemical compounds . These sub-\nstancesare transported acrossthe system membrane, usually b y transportproteins,\ni.e. e\ufb00ectively there is a sink or source for some of the species on the system bound-\nary, e.g. the (plasma) membrane. The spatial separation between the sink or source\nand the chemistry that takes place in the bulk phase then creates s patial variations\nin concentration.\nWhen the system is not homogeneousand not at steadystate, the concentrations\nneedtobespeci\ufb01edasfunctionsoftimeandspace(i.e. ci(x,t)), andboundary\ufb02uxes\narerequired.

The concentrations ciof the species are functions of\ntime (0< t < t end) and space ( x\u2208V), and their evolution is governed by the\nbalance (reaction-di\ufb00usion) equations (Katchalsky and Curran 19 65)\n\u2202\n\u2202tci\u2212\u03b1DiDi\u2206ci=m/summationdisplay\nj=1Nij\u03b1vjvj, x\u2208V,0< t < t end. (2)\nThe parameter Diis the di\ufb00usion coe\ufb03cient of species Yi. It is considered homo-\ngeneous. For Cartesian coordinates the Laplacian \u2206 is de\ufb01ned as\n\u2206 =\u22022\n\u2202x2\n1+\u22022\n\u2202x2\n2+\u22022\n\u2202x2\n3.\nThe operator \u2206 has the dimension of 1 /length2[m\u22122].Dihas the dimension of\nsurface per time [m2/s] and is assumed to be the same throughout volume V. In\norder to assess the importance of di\ufb00usion of a substance for the behavior of the\nsystem, we shall modulate the di\ufb00usion processes. To this aim, Diis multiplied\nby the dimensionless modulation parameter \u03b1Di, which has the value of 1 in the\nreference state.\nIn addition to Eq. 2, which holds in the bulk, represented by V, we need to\nspecify the behaviour at the boundary Sof the set V. For a species Yifor which\nthe membrane is a passive barrier we assume a closed boundary cond ition,\n\u2212\u03b1DiDi\u2202ci\n\u2202\u03bd= 0 on S. (3)\nThe vector \u03bdis the normal vector of unit length pointing out of V, and\u2202ci/\u2202\u03bdis\nthe derivative of ciin the direction of \u03bd.

Like other \u03b1\u2019s,\u03b1fiis a parameter\nthat we shall use to modulate the transport activity. This modulatio n is equivalent\nto changes in the activity or concentration of membrane enzymes o r carriers. We\nshall refer to the \u2018\ufb02ux Jthrough the system\u2019 as the magnitude of the net export of\nY1, integrated over the surface of Vand normalized by the surface area:\nJ=\u03b1f1\n|S|/integraldisplay\nSf1dS (5)\nWe normalizethe total \ufb02owwith respectto the correspondingsurf aceareato obtain\na surface-averaged \ufb02ux.

Some reactions that involve\ncytoplasmic substances only occur in the membrane or at the membr ane surface.\nThis is equivalent to the substrate of the reaction being exported a nd the product\nof the reaction being imported, and will be treated as such.\n2.2.Parameter Modulation and Control Analysis. We have explicitly intro-\nduced dimensionless modulation parameters \u03b1vj,\u03b1Di, and\u03b1fi, through which the\nsystem can be modi\ufb01ed. For the formulation and interpretation of c ontrol theorems\nassociated with di\ufb00usion we need to introduce two additional forms o f modulation,\nassociated with space and time, in the following way. We assume that t he spa-\ntial and temporal variables x1,x2,x3, andt, are related to a reference spatial and\ntemporal frame \u03be1,\u03be2,\u03be3, and\u03c4, via dimensionless modulation parameters \u03b1Land\n\u03b1t:\nx1=\u03b1L\u03be1, x 2=\u03b1L\u03be2, x 3=\u03b1L\u03be3,andt=\u03b1t\u03c4.(6)\nNote that a reference time interval [0 ,\u03c4end] is rescaled to an actual time interval\n[0,\u03b1t\u03c4end] =\u03b1t[0,\u03c4end]; and similarly, the reference volume Vis scaled to an actual\nvolume\u03b1LV(Figure 1).\nV\n\u03b1LV\nFigure 1. The domain Vis scaled by geometric multiplication\nWe shall be explicit about the cause-and-e\ufb00ect relationship that ex ists between\nparameters andstate. The parameters are the kinetic constants in rate functions vj\nandfiand di\ufb00usion coe\ufb03cients Di, together with their modulators \u03b1vj,\u03b1Di, and\n\u03b1fi. We also consider the volume Vand the time interval [0 ,\u03c4end] as parameters,\ntogether with the space and time modulators \u03b1Land\u03b1t. A \ufb01nal \u2018parameter\u2019 that\nCONTROL OF HETEROGENEOUS NETWORKS 5\nwe need to take into account is the distribution of all species in space at the initial\ntime.\nFor a given choice of all parameters the concentration of each of t he species Yi\nis determined uniquely as a function of space and time, according to E qs. 2 and 4.\nThe choice of parameters yields a a unique set of functions ci(x,t), each de\ufb01ned at\nevery point x\u2208\u03b1LVand at each time t\u2208[0,\u03b1t\u03c4end].\nNote that the functions ciare de\ufb01ned on di\ufb00erent domains for di\ufb00erent \u03b1Land\n\u03b1t. Forcomparisonpurposes it will be more convenientto think of cias functions of\nthe reference coordinates \u03beand\u03c4and the modulation parameters \u03b1, i.e.ci(\u03be,\u03c4,\u03b1),\nwhere\u03be\u2208V,\u03c4\u2208[0,\u03c4end], and\u03b1= (\u03b1vj,\u03b1Di,\u03b1fi,\u03b1L,\u03b1t). The functions ci(\u03be,\u03c4,\u03b1)\ndetermine the stateof the system associated with the choice of parameters.\nThe change of coordinates, from ( x,t) to (\u03be,\u03c4), induces a small modi\ufb01cation in\nEqs. 2 and 4, which now become\n\u03b1\u22121\nt\u2202\n\u2202\u03c4ci\u2212\u03b1\u22122\nL\u03b1DiDi\u2206ci=m/summationdisplay\nj=1Nij\u03b1vjvj, \u03be\u2208V,0< \u03c4 < \u03c4 end(7)\n\u2212\u03b1\u22121\nL\u03b1DiDi\u2202ci\n\u2202\u03bd=\u03b1fifi \u03be\u2208S,0< \u03c4 < \u03c4 end(8)\nNote that the di\ufb00erentiation in the operators \u2206 and \u2202/\u2202\u03bdis now with respect\nto\u03be. The de\ufb01nition of the \ufb02ux, however, remains unchanged under this change of\ncoordinates, because of the surface averaging:\nJ=\u03b1f1\n|S|/integraldisplay\nSf1dS (9)\nIn the vein of Metabolic Control Analysis we will consider a reference state\nassociated with the choice \u03b1vj=\u03b1Di=\u03b1fi=\u03b1L=\u03b1t= 1 and a second state,\nresulting from an in\ufb01nitesimal change in one of these modulators. Th e di\ufb00erence\nbetween the two states will be taken to characterize the control that the modulated\nparameter has on the state of the system. The dimensionless para meter\u03b1vjis\nthe tool we shall use to modulate the activity of reaction vj. Departures of \u03b1vj\nfrom 1 correspond to a modulation of enzyme catalytic activity or co ncentration,\nor to a proportional modulation of all rate constants of the react ion step if it is not\nenzyme catalyzed (this modulation leaves the equilibrium constant un changed, for\ndetails see (Kholodenko and Westerho\ufb00 1993, 1994, 1995), where this approach was\nintroduced). For instance, if reaction 1 is a protein-protein intera ction (a central\nreaction in signaling networks), the rate vjdepends on two kinetic constants, kon\nandko\ufb00, and a change in \u03b1vjcorresponds to equal proportional change of both\nconstants that leaves the dissociation (equilibrium) constant Kdunchanged. The\nratio of the fractional change in a state variable of the reaction ne twork, such as\nJorck, and the fractional change in \u03b1vjdetermines the control coe\ufb03cient with\nrespect to reaction rate vj(in the limit of in\ufb01nitesimally small changes):\nCJ\nvj=dlnJ\ndln\u03b1vj/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle\n\u03b1vj=1, Cckvj=dlnck\ndln\u03b1vj/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle\n\u03b1vj=1,\nwhere\u03b1vj= 1 corresponds to the reference state (all other parameters a re assumed\n\ufb01xed). Similarly, considering two states corresponding to small mod ulations in di-\nmensionless parameters, \u03b1fiand\u03b1Di, we de\ufb01ne the control coe\ufb03cients with respect\nto transport reaction and di\ufb00usion, CJ\nfiandCJ\nDi.\n6 MARK A. PELETIER, HANS V. WESTERHOFF, AND BORIS N. KHOLODEN KO\nAn intrinsically novel control coe\ufb03cient emerges as the heterogen eous spatial\norganization of cellular reaction network is taken into account. This coe\ufb03cient is\nobtained when the size ( L) of the system is modi\ufb01ed through a modulation of the\ndimensionless parameter \u03b1L, as shown schematically in Fig. 1, whilst keeping \ufb01xed\nallother parameters. In a cell setting, these parametersinclude the volumeand sur-\nface concentrations of enzymes and other molecular forms, the t otal concentrations\nof which are conserved (for instance, the total amount of phosp horylated and un-\nphosphorylated forms of a protein) in network reactions describe d by Eqs. 7 and 8.\nTherefore, increasing the cell size also implies adding conserved che mical moieties\nand additional enzymes both to the bulk aqueous phase and cell mem branes. Ac-\ncordingly, the \u2018spatial\u2019 control coe\ufb03cient is de\ufb01ned as CJ\nL=dlnJ/dln\u03b1L, where\nonly the spatial variables are modulated, as described above (Eq. 6 ). It is of note,\nthat the parameter Lcan be interpreted as the characteristic cell size, e.g., the vol-\nume to surface ratio, whose fractional changes are equal to the fractional changes\nin\u03b1L.\nAspecialcaseofEq.7ariseswhenweonlyconsidersteady-state, non-equilibrium\ncon\ufb01gurations; these correspond to solutions c1(\u03be),...,c n(\u03be) of the steady-state\nequations\n\u2212\u03b1\u22122\nL\u03b1DiDi\u2206ci=m/summationdisplay\nj=1Nij\u03b1vjvj, \u03be\u2208V, (10)\nwithboundaryconditions8.

We generalize this summation theorem for sys tems where\nconcentrations may not be homogeneous and where transport oc curs \u2014 here the\nsum over all the reactive processes need not be 1. The \ufb02ux may be p artially\ncontrolled by di\ufb00usion or by transport and it is because of this contr ol that the\nclassical summation theorem no longer holds. The generalized summa tion theorem\ntakes the form\nn/summationdisplay\ni=1CJ\nDi+m/summationdisplay\nj=1CJ\nvj+n/summationdisplay\ni=1CJ\nfi= 1. (11)\nIn words this theorem reads: the total control by all di\ufb00usion, re action, and trans-\nport processes on any steady state \ufb02ux equals 1. The proof of Eq . 11 is based on\nEuler\u2019s theorem on homogeneous function, which can be stated as f ollows. Let g\nbe a function of p1,...,p n, such that for all piand for all \u03bb >0,\ng(\u03bb\u03b21p1,...,\u03bb\u03b2npn) =\u03bb\u03b3g(p1,...,p n), (12)\nfor some \u03b21,...,\u03b2 n,\u03b3\u2208R, i.e.,g(p1,...,p n) is the same function after the trans-\nformation\n\u02dcg=\u03bb\u03b3g,\u02dcpi=\u03bb\u03b2ipi. (13)\nThen\nn/summationdisplay\ni=1\u03b2i\u2202ln|g|\n\u2202lnpi=\u03b3. (14)\nCONTROL OF HETEROGENEOUS NETWORKS 7\nIt may be noted that for some of the parameters pi,\u03b2imay equal zero. These\nparameters are not modulated in Eq. 13, and Eq. 14 shows that the se parameters\nare absent from the summation theorem.\nFor\u03b3andall\u03b2iequalto 1, Eq.14remindsofthe \ufb02ux controlsummation theorem\nof Metabolic Control Analysis (Kacser and Burns 1973; Heinrich and Rapoport\n1973), but it may not be clear a prioriwhat function and which parameters should\nbe considered. When searching for other than the traditional sum mation theorems,\na strategy may prove useful. One strategy is that of leaving the sy stem in essence\nin the same state (cf. (Kacser and Burns 1973)). In terms of the system under\nconsideration this translates into the concentrations ci(\u03be,\u03c4) remaining the same\nwhen the parameters piof Eq. 13 are changed.\nIn order to implement the above strategy and examine under what t ype of pa-\nrameter changes ci(\u03be,\u03c4) might be constant, one may inspect the equations that\nde\ufb01neci. For steady states Eqs. 10 and 8 de\ufb01ne ci(\u03be). Multiplying both equa-\ntions by the same factor \u03bbshould leave their solutions unchanged. Consequently,\nmultiplying all \u03b1Di, all\u03b1vj, and all \u03b1fiby that same factor should not change\nthe solutions ci(\u03be) either: the terms in the equations are homogeneous functions of\n\ufb01rst order of the parameters \u03b1Di,\u03b1vj, and\u03b1fi. When only these parameters are\nmodulated, the speci\ufb01c transport rate remains unaltered, becau se the metabolite\nconcentrations remain constant and neither \u03b1Di,\u03b1vj, or\u03b1fioccurs in the function\nfi(c1,...,c n). Consequently firemains unchanged, and therefore we can calculate\nthe corresponding \ufb02ux as a function of \u03bb,\nJ(\u03bb) =\u03bb\u03b1f1\n|S|/integraldisplay\nSf1=\u03bbJ(1).\nWe can reformulate this result as follows: we have shown that the \ufb02u xJ, as a\nfunction of the parameters \u03b1Di,\u03b1vj, and\u03b1fi, satis\ufb01es\nJ(\u03bb\u03b1D1,...,\u03bb\u03b1 Dn,\u03bb\u03b1v1,...,\u03bb\u03b1 vm,\u03bb\u03b1f1,...,\u03bb\u03b1 fn)\n=\u03bbJ(\u03b1D1,...,\u03b1 Dn,\u03b1v1,...,\u03b1 vm,\u03b1f1,...,\u03b1 fn).\nEquality 11 now follows from Eq. 14.\nIt should be remembered that the parameters \u03b1Di,\u03b1vj, and\u03b1firepresentthe ac-\ntivities of di\ufb00usion, chemical, and transport processes, respectiv ely. Consequently,\nEq. 11 really refers to a theorem concerning the control by di\ufb00usio n, chemistry and\ntransport. It is an extension, both in concept and in proof, of the familiar \ufb02ux con-\ntrol summation theorem of Metabolic Control Analysis. The latter o nly dealt with\nthe middle terms of the left-hand side and then only the enzyme cata lyzed reac-\ntions thereof, it assumed concentrations to be homogeneous in sp ace, and neglected\nexplicit transport terms.\nA further extension to the above methodology will generalize the ab ove sum-\nmation theorem to systems that depend on time: Dropping the assu mption of\nsteady state, Eqs. 7 and 8 become the equations that de\ufb01ne ci(\u03be,\u03c4). Multiplying\nboth these equations by the same factor \u03bbagain leaves their solutions unchanged.\nConsequently:\n\u2212CJ(\u03c4)\nt+n/summationdisplay\ni=1CJ(\u03c4)\nDi+m/summationdisplay\nj=1CJ(\u03c4)\nvj+n/summationdisplay\ni=1CJ(\u03c4)\nfi= 1.

How can we understand this theorem and in particularthis ne w time-control\ncoe\ufb03cient? Let us \ufb01rstconsiderthe situation that would ensue fro msimultaneously\nand equally increasing all the parameters \u03b1Di,\u03b1vj, and\u03b1fiby 1% in the absence\nof an increase in \u03b1t. Because all activities increase, also the \ufb02ux Jshould increase.\nHowever, the system should also change more quickly in time, i.e. the in crease in\nmagnitude of Jshould occur earlier. To obtain a proportionate increase in J, one\nshould look at an earlier point in time, i.e. time should be 1% earlier, or, ke eping\nin mind that t=\u03b1tT,\u03b1t= 0.99.\nCJ(\u03c4)\ntshould not be confused with the time-dependent control coe\ufb03cien ts de-\n\ufb01ned by (Westerho\ufb00 and van Dam 1987; Heinrich and Reder 1991). F or a further\ndiscussion of the distinctions, see also (Kholodenko et al. 1997) for the control\nanalysis of relaxations in the vicinity of the steady state.\nOften, as time goes to in\ufb01nity, the system relaxes to a steady stat e. The control\nby time on the \ufb02ux then reduces to zero and the summation theorem for the time\ndependent controlcoe\ufb03cients reduces to the one for steady st ate controlcoe\ufb03cients\n(Eq. 11).\nThe summation theorem 15 is more general than suggested by the a bove deriva-\ntion. It can be derived without requiring explicit equations for the tim e evolution\nof the system, such as Eqs. 7 and 8. The proof then considers an a ctual physical\ntransformationof the system under consideration: all the time de pendent elemental\nprocesses are increased by the same factor \u03bb. This implies that everything happens\nin the same way, but faster by that same factor \u03bb. We represent this concept of\n\u2018faster\u2019 by the parameter \u03b1t, as above (since t=\u03b1t\u03c4,\u03b1t<1 correspondsto \u2018faster\u2019,\nand\u03b1t>1 to \u2018slower\u2019). Writing the parameter-dependence explicitly,\nci(\u03be,\u03c4) =ci(\u03be,\u03c4;\u03b1Di,\u03b1vj,\u03b1fi,\u03b1L,\u03b1t),\nwe have\nci/parenleftBig\n\u03be,\u03c4;\u03bb\u03b1Di,\u03bb\u03b1vj,\u03bb\u03b1fi,\u03b1L,\u03b1t\n\u03bb/parenrightBig\n=ci(\u03be,\u03c4;\u03b1Di,\u03b1vj,\u03b1fi,\u03b1fi,\u03b1t),\nor in other words, ciis homogeneous of zeroth order in \u03b1Di,\u03b1vj,\u03b1fi, and 1/\u03b1t.\nUsing Eq. 14 this yields the summation theorem for concentrations,\n\u2212Cck\nt+n/summationdisplay\ni=1Cck\nDi+m/summationdisplay\nj=1Cckvj+n/summationdisplay\ni=1Cck\nfi= 0.

The theorem we shall develop no w is intrinsi-\ncally new as its origin lies in spatial aspects that have hitherto been ne glected in\nCONTROL OF HETEROGENEOUS NETWORKS 9\nMetabolic Control Analysis (Fell 1997). The strategy we follow is aga in to con-\nsider a transformation for which the system properties should not change. We \ufb01rst\ndiscuss the nature of di\ufb00usion, as illustrated by Einstein\u2019s di\ufb00usion eq uation:\n\u03b4x=/radicalbig\nnDD\u03b4t,\nwherenDis a number of order 1 that depends on the dimensionality. In words,\nthe displacement due to di\ufb00usion increases with the square root of t he di\ufb00usion\ncoe\ufb03cient. Consequently, increasing all di\ufb00usion coe\ufb03cients by \u03bb2should increase\nall displacement by the factor \u03bb.\nThis becomes obvious when considering Eq. 7. Replacing \u03b1Diby\u03bb2\u03b1Diand\n\u03b1Lby\u03bb\u03b1Lleaves Eq. 7 unchanged. The boundary condition 8 in a natural way\nsuggests replacing \u03b1fiby\u03bb\u03b1fi, so that this equation is also essentially unchanged.\nAs a result this choice of parameters leaves the solution ciinvariant:\nci(\u03be,\u03c4;\u03bb2\u03b1Di,\u03b1vj,\u03bb\u03b1fi,\u03bb\u03b1L,\u03b1t) =ci(\u03be,\u03c4;\u03b1Di,\u03b1vj,\u03b1fi,\u03b1L,\u03b1t).(17)\nWe immediately deduce the second summation theorem for concentr ations,\n2n/summationdisplay\ni=1Cc\nDi+n/summationdisplay\ni=1Cc\nfi+Cc\nL= 0, (18)\nwherecstands for any ci(\u03be,\u03c4). Similarly, since the \ufb02ux satis\ufb01es\nJ(\u03c4;\u03bb2\u03b1Di,\u03b1vj,\u03bb\u03b1fi,\u03bb\u03b1L,\u03b1t) =\u03bbJ(\u03c4;\u03b1Di,\u03b1vj,\u03b1fi,\u03b1L,\u03b1t),\nthe associated summation theorem results\n2n/summationdisplay\ni=1CJ(\u03c4)\nDi+n/summationdisplay\ni=1CJ(\u03c4)\nfi+CJ(\u03c4)\nL= 1. (19)\nNaturally, if we only consider steady states, then ci(\u03be,\u03c4) reduces to ci(\u03be), andJ(\u03c4)\ntoJ.\nThe modulation of V, via\u03b1L, implicated in the evaluation of the corresponding\ncontrol coe\ufb03cient is one in which the size of the system changes; it is important,\nhowever, that the system size changes whilst keeping the volume co ncentration of\nenzymes in the bulk aqueous phase constant and the surface conc entrations of the\nmembrane enzymes constant.\nToillustratethemodulationintroducedabove,considerthecaseof aone-dimensional\nspatial domain of the form (0 ,\u221e); the membrane is thought to be at x= 0, and\nthe cell is deemed so large that the \u2018other end\u2019 is e\ufb00ectively at in\ufb01nity .

We do\nso here for a kinase/phosphatase example that we also discussed in (Brown and\nKholodenko 1999; Kholodenko et al. 2000a). There are two species ,YandYP,\nwhich are the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated form of a give n protein; the\nkinase converts YintoYP, and the phosphatase does the reverse.\nBesides providing an illustration of the concepts and results discuss ed above we\nwishtodemonstratethein\ufb02uenceofthesystemgeometryonthec ontrolcoe\ufb03cients.\nWe consider two cases:\n(1)Vis bounded by two parallel membranes; the kinase reaction is localized\nto one membrane, the phosphatase to the other (Figure 3);\n(2)Vis a spherical region (e.g. a cell or an organelle) bounded by a membra ne;\nthe kinase is localized at the membrane, but the phosphatase is distr ibuted\nthroughout the bulk (Figure 4).\nCONTROL OF HETEROGENEOUS NETWORKS 11\nAsweshallseebelow,inthecaseofparallelmembranesthesizecont rolcoe\ufb03cient\nCJ\nLisnegative: an increase in the distance between the membranes reduces the \ufb02 ux\nthrough the system.

We assume that the system is large with respect\nto the distance Lbetween the membranes and therefore adopt a one-dimensional\nformulation. We also restrict the study to (non-equilibrium) steady state.\nSince no reaction takes place in the bulk, the equations satis\ufb01ed by YandYP\nin the bulk (Eq. 10) reduce to\n\u2212\u03b1\u22122\nL\u03b1DDYP\u2032\u2032=\u2212\u03b1\u22122\nL\u03b1DDY\u2032\u2032= 0,0< \u03be < L.

From the solution of equations (21\u201323) the\nrelevant information for our purposes is \u03b4:\n\u03b4=M(\u03b2p\u03b1k\u03bak\u2212\u03b2k\u03b1p\u03bap)\n\u03b1\u22121\nL\u03b1DD(\u03b2k+\u03b2p)+L\u03b2k\u03b2p.

More than an analys is procedure,\nMetabolic Control Analysis also provided biochemists with a set of laws (theorems)\nthat govern control of \ufb02uxes and concentrations in metabolic net works. One type\nof these were the summation theorems, stating that the sum of th e control by all\nthe individual enzyme catalyzed reactions on \ufb02ux and concentratio n (Kacser and\nBurns 1973; Heinrich and Rapoport 1973), oscillation amplitude (Kho lodenko et al.\n1997) or relaxation time constant (Heinrich and Reder 1991) should equal 1, 0, 1,\nand 1 respectively.\nThose were the days where biochemistry focused on metabolism. Ho wever, only\na minor fraction of the known genomes encodes primary metabolism. Much coding\ncapacity is devoted to regulation, in part through signal transduc tion (Kell 1979;\nKholodenko et al. 2000c). Signal transduction has (i) the spatial a spect that many\nsignals arrive at the cell\u2019s plasma membrane and have to be transferr ed to its\n16 MARK A. PELETIER, HANS V. WESTERHOFF, AND BORIS N. KHOLODE NKO\nnuclear DNA, (ii) the added complication that much of the signal is tra nsferred\nby proteins in direct phosphoryl transfers, rather than with sma ll molecules as\nmessengers, and (iii) the feature that those proteins are often p resent at a thousand\ntimes lower concentrations than the usual metabolite. All these th ree features work\nin the direction that might make di\ufb00usion of the components limiting in sig nal\ntransfer. Indeed, it was calculated that for realisticparameter v alues, concentration\ngradientsinsignal(de\ufb01nedasin(Franckeetal.)) shouldarise(Fell1 980;Brownand\nKholodenko 1999; Kholodenko et al. 2000a), which might even force the cell to take\nrefuge to alternative mechanisms of movement of the signal prote ins (Kholodenko\n2002).\nWith the realization of the possible importance of transport and di\ufb00u sion for\ncell biochemistry, there came a need to update Metabolic Control A nalysis so as\nto include the aspects of di\ufb00usion. This is what the \ufb01rst part of this p aper accom-\nplished for the summation theorem. The result was rather simple, to the sum of the\nenzyme control coe\ufb03cients also coe\ufb03cients for the control by th e di\ufb00usion of the\nvarious species needed to be added, as well as control coe\ufb03cients for the transport\nprocesses and for the non-enzyme-catalyzed chemical reaction s, before it amounted\nto 1 for \ufb02ux control and 0 for concentration control. This result is perhaps not\nsurprising, but has been overlooked e\ufb00ectively in the literature for quite a while. In\nstudies of the control of growth rate of E. coliby the lactose permease, it was found\nthat a sum of 1 could not be found and it was suspected that part of the control\nresided in di\ufb00usion across the outer membrane (Jensen et al. 1993; Dykhuizen et al.\n1987). It was found that none of the glycolytic enzymes had signi\ufb01c ant control on\nthe glycolytic \ufb02ux in yeast. This was considered a problem until stron g indica-\ntions arose of substantial control in glucose transport into the c ells (Reijenga et al.\n2001). Thus, if anything, our extension of the summation theorem to include the\ntransport steps may open eyes to the possibility that transport c ontrols metabolic\n\ufb02uxes. Similarly we should expect renewed attention to arise from th e other term\nin our summation theorem, i.e. the one that refers to control by th e di\ufb00usion. Of\ncourse the novelty lies not so much in the possibility of such control, b ut in the fact\nthat it may account for a shortfall of metabolic control from the t otal of 1.\nWe have also formulated the summation theorem for the case of inho mogeneity\nin both time and space, i.e. where a spatial gradient may be developing over time.\nIn that case di\ufb00usion and time turn out to share in the total \ufb02ux con trol of 1.\nIn the case of homogeneity in time (i.e. at steady state), the forme r contribution\ndisappears, in case of spatial homogeneity the latter. The experim ental system\nthat springs to mind is that of Belousov-Zhabotinsky reactions exh ibiting time\nvarying spirals (Zhabotinsky and Zaikin 1973), but closer to biology t he wave type\noscillations in yeast extracts (Mair et al. 2001). The most relevant a pplication\nmay be in developmental biology, but for this an extension to Hierarc hical Control\nAnalysis (Snoep et al. 2002) will be needed.\nWhile the \ufb01rst \ufb02ux summation result, Eq. 11, and the \ufb01rst concentr ation sum-\nmation result, Eq. 16, are a simple extension of existing theory, the summation\ntheorems concerning changes of spatial scale (Eqs. 18, 19, and 2 0) are fundamen-\ntally new, and introduce a concept that is new to Metabolic Control A nalysis:\ncontrol by size.\nCONTROL OF HETEROGENEOUS NETWORKS 17\n\u2018Control by the size\u2019, the quantity measured by CL, is a concept with some\ninteresting properties. For instance, CJ\nLandCc\nLcan be both positive and negative.\nThis is related to the fact that the size of a system can in\ufb02uence the \u2018productive\u2019\ncapacity of the system in di\ufb00erent ways at the same time. Let us exa mine this for\n\ufb02ux control:\n\u2022Size can be an obstacle: if material has to travel over a distance L, as in the\nexample of parallel membranes (Case 1 of Section 5), then an increa se inL\nimplies a decrease of the (average) concentration gradient, and t herefore\ncauses a reduction in di\ufb00usive \ufb02ux. This is the dominant e\ufb00ect in the\nlarge-Llimit of Case 1, as shown in Fig. 5, where it leads to a limit value\nofCJ\nLof\u22121.\n\u2022On the other hand, size can also be a resource: if a reaction takes p lace in\na bulk region of linear size L, thenLis also a measure of reactive capacity:\nan increase in size will result in an increase of total reactive \ufb02ux. This is\ndemonstrated by the second example, where the input- and outpu t bound-\naries are co-located and no material is forced to travel over a dist anceL.\nHere the control by size is positive, and in the limit of small Lthe control\neven approaches 1.\nThe new summation theorems have a number of interesting implication s. Per-\nhaps the most striking one is that they impose an upper limit to the con trol that\ndi\ufb00usion may have on the \ufb02ux through the system. The \ufb01rst summat ion theorem\nsuggested that this number be 1, i.e. if the biochemical and the tran sport processes\nwere in excess and the system were large; the second, however, s hows that it is only\n1/2whenever the controlby size is positive (i.e. when increasingthe siz e results in a\nhiger \ufb02ux). Clearly, in such cases there must always be another pro cess controlling\n\ufb02ux, in addition to di\ufb00usion. In the example of Fig. 6 the other proces ses were the\nbiochemical reactions.\nThe example of Figure 2 also shows how changing the di\ufb00usion rate alte rs the\nconcentration pro\ufb01les. By increasing the di\ufb00usion rate we increase the width of\na \u2018boundary layer\u2019, in which a signi\ufb01cant part of the reactions takes p lace. As\na result the \ufb02ux is also increased. Note, however, that the relative increase in\nsize of the boundary layer (which scales as \u03bb, sincex=\u03b1L\u03be=\u03bb\u03be) is the square\nroot of the increase of the di\ufb00usion coe\ufb03cients ( \u03b1Di=\u03bb2). This can be explained\nintuitivelyasfollows. The sizeofthe boundarylayeris determined byc ounteracting\nforces; a thin boundary layer provides for fast spatial transpor t (on the scale of the\nlayer thickness), but little reactive capacity, while for a thick layer t he situation\nis inversed. An increase in di\ufb00usion rate is therefore used partially to increase\ntransport rate, and partially to increase reaction capacity. The n umber 1/2 is the\nresult of this trade-o\ufb00.\nAcknowledgement\nThis workwas supported by the RTN network \u2018Nonlinear Partial Di\ufb00er ential Equa-\ntions describing Front Propagation and other Singular Phenomena\u2019, HPRN-CT-\n2002-00274, and by the National Institute of Health through Gra nt GM59570.\n18 MARK A.

We study a mathematical model of a blood circulation network which is a\ngeneralization of the coronary model proposed by Smith, Pullan and Hunter. We prove the\nexistence and uniqueness of the solution to the initial-boundary valu e problem and discuss\nthe continuity of dependence of the solution and its derivatives on in itial, boundary and\nforcing functions and their derivatives.\n1 Introduction\nIn a recent paper [13], Smith, Pullan and Hunter propose a mathemat ical model of blood\ncirculation in the coronary network, and conduct a numerical analy sis. In their model, major\nvessels (with cross-sectional areas larger thana certain value) a re treated as a connected one-\ndimensional network, andsmall vessels, such asarterioles, capillar ies andvenules, aretreated\nas lumped elements which are connected to the network of vessels. The \ufb02ow on vessels are\nassumed to be incompressible, homogeneous, Newtonian, and has a small Reynolds number.\nThus, the mass balance equation and Navier-Stokes equation can b e written to describe the\npressure and the \ufb02ow rate on vessels. Equations on lumped element s are written in analogy\nwith the current and voltage in an electric circuit. The result is an initia l-boundary value\nproblem of a system of hyperbolic type partial di\ufb00erential equation s coupled at junctions\nof the network. Although the result of the numerical analysis cond ucted in [13] matches\nclosely with measured data, the well-posedness problem of the syst em of partial di\ufb00erential\nequations, that is, the existence, uniqueness and the continuous dependence on initial and\nboundary data of the solution, has not been established before. T he main objective of this\npaper is to establish the well-posedness. We prove that the system is well-posed under\ncertain natural conditions. This work is an extension of our earlier w ork [12] on a model\nof blood circulation in the brain. The main di\ufb00erences between the two models are that\nthe network con\ufb01guration in [12] is more complicated owing to the pre sence of Willis loops,\nbut the coupling junction conditions in the model of [13] are more com plicated due to the\ndi\ufb00erent formulation and the inclusion of the capillaries and veinal sys tem. We combine\nboth features in a more general system with the hope that our res ult will be useful in the\n1\nmodelling of circulation systems of higher complexity, including the who le body circulation\nsystem.\nBefore stating our system, let us brie\ufb02y describe the model in [13]. L etPiandRi\nrepresent the pressure and radius on the i-th vessel, respectively, and let Vibe the cross-\nsectional average of the axial component vi,xof the velocity on the i-th vessel. Assuming\nthat the radial component vi,rof the velocity is small compared to the axial component vi,x\nof the velocity, one can write equations of mass balance\n\u2202Ri\n\u2202t+Vi\u2202Ri\n\u2202x+Ri\n2\u2202Vi\n\u2202x= 0, (1.1)\nand momentum balance\n\u2202Vi\n\u2202t+2(1\u2212\u03b1i)Vi\nRi\u2202Ri\n\u2202t+\u03b1iVi\u2202Vi\n\u2202x+1\n\u03c1\u2202Pi\n\u2202x=2\u03bd\nRi/bracketleftbigg\u2202vi,x\n\u2202r/bracketrightbigg\nr=Ri. (1.2)\nHere\u03bdis the viscosity constant and\n\u03b1i=1\nR2\niV2\ni/integraldisplayRi\n02rv2\ni,xdr\nis the energy quantity. Taking into consideration of no-slip boundar y condition ( vi,x= 0\nifr=Ri), the viscous axisymmetry ( \u2202vi,x/\u2202r= 0 ifr= 0), and the fact that Viis the\ncross-sectional average of vi,x, Smith, Pullan and Hunter propose the velocity pro\ufb01le\nvi,x(r,x) =\u03b3i+2\n\u03b3iVi(x)/bracketleftbigg\n1\u2212/parenleftbiggr\nRi/parenrightbigg\u03b3i/bracketrightbigg\nwhere\u03b3iis a positive number. Using this pro\ufb01le and the mass balance condition ( 1.1), Eq.\n(1.2) becomes\n\u2202Vi\n\u2202t+(2\u03b1i\u22121)Vi\u2202Vi\n\u2202x+2(\u03b1i\u22121)V2\ni\nRi\u2202Ri\n\u2202x+1\n\u03c1\u2202Pi\n\u2202x=\u22122\u03bd\u03b1i\n\u03b1i\u22121Vi\nR2\ni(1.3)\nwith\n\u03b1i=\u03b3i+2\n\u03b3i\u2208(1,\u221e).\nThe pressure Piand the radius Riare related by a function\nPi=Pi(x,Ri).\nIn [13], it is assumed that\nPi(x,Ri) =C/bracketleft\uf8ecigg/parenleftbiggRi\nR0/parenrightbigg\u03b2\n\u22121/bracketright\uf8ecigg\n2\nwhereC,R0and\u03b2are constants. We do not make such an assumption, only assume th at it\nis a di\ufb00erentiable function and\u2202Pi\n\u2202Ri>0\nfor allxandRi. Let\nAi=\u03c0R2\ni, Qi=AiVi\nbe the cross-section area and the \ufb02ow rate, respectively. It can be shown that the system of\nequations (1.1) and (1.3) is equivalent to\n\u2202Ai\n\u2202t+\u2202Qi\n\u2202x= 0,\n\u2202Qi\n\u2202t+\u03b1i\u2202\n\u2202x/parenleftbiggQ2\ni\nA/parenrightbigg\n+Ai\n\u03c1\u2202Pi\n\u2202x=\u22124\u03c0\u03bd\u03b1i\n\u03b1i\u22121Qi\nAi.(1.4)\nAlso, by rescaling the spatial variable x, we may assume that each vessel is parameterized\ntox\u2208(0,1).\nThe system of di\ufb00erential equations are supplemented with the initia l condition\nPi(x,0) =PI\ni(x), Qi(x,0) =QI\ni(x) (1.5)\nand boundary conditions. Boundary conditions at each end of the v essel are given according\nto the type of the end. If it is an external end of the network, eith er the pressure\nPi=PB\ni(t) (1.6)\nor the \ufb02ow rate\nQi=QB\ni(t) (1.7)\nis speci\ufb01ed. If the end is a branching junction, a junction connecting several vessels, let\nj1,...,j \u03bdandj\u03bd+1,...,j \u00b5denote the incoming and outgoing vessels, respectively.

(In [13], every branching junction connects only t hree vessels, it is either a\n3\nbifurcation point of one artery into two smaller ones or a joining point of two veins into a\nbigger one. Our prescription allows more general con\ufb01guration of t he network, including the\npresence of Willis loops.) If the end is a transitional junction , which connects the vessel to a\nnetwork of arterioles, capillaries and venules, we follow the so called microcirculation model\nproposed in [13, 14]. Generalizing from [13], arterioles or venules conn ected to the vessel jl\nare represented by a lumped resistive element Rjl.

Apart from the junction conditions,\nthis system is the same as the one we study in [12]. Also, the junction c onditions in [12] is\nthe special case of (1.8)\u2013( 1.9) above with \u03c1i= 0. As in [12], we use a \ufb01xed point principle\nto prove the solvability of the problem. Substituting a pair of functio ns (pi,qi) for (Pi,Qi) in\nthe coe\ufb03cients ai,bi,ci,Aiand forcing functions fi,gi, the system becomes linear. That is,\nall the functions ai, etc. are independent of unknowns. If the linear system has a uniq ue so-\nlution, then, one can establish a mapping from ( pi,qi) to the linear problem solution ( Pi,Qi).\nIf one also shows that this mapping has a unique \ufb01xed point, then the \ufb01xed point is neces-\nsarily the unique solution of the quasilinear system. Hence, we shall \ufb01 rst give a condition\nfor the linear system to have a unique solution, then examine under w hat conditions the\nmapping has a unique \ufb01xed point. The \ufb01rst aspect of the problem is inv estigated in Section\n2 and the second in Section 3. We also prove a result on the continuity of dependence of\nsolutions on the initial, boundary and forcing functions for linear and quasilinear systems,\nthus, completing the analysis of the well-posedness of the problem. In spite of similarity in\nparts of the analysis to the one used in [12], the more general branc hing junction condition\nand the new transitional junction conditions require more careful treatments. Hence, there\nare substantial variations in the analysis. For completeness and to bene\ufb01t the reader, we\ninclude all the major arguments in this paper.\n5\n2 The linear system\nIn this section, we analyze (1.13) as a linear system with ai,bi,ci,fi,gi,Aiindependent of\nPiandQi. The initial and boundary conditions are given by (1.5)\u2013(1.12) excep t that the\njunction condition (1.9) is substituted by the more general conditio n\n\u03c1jl\u2202Qjl\n\u2202t=Ajl(Pjl\u2212Pjunc)+Cjl, \u03c1jl\u2032\u2202Qjl\u2032\n\u2202t=Ajl\u2032/parenleftbig\nPjunc\u2212Pjl\u2032/parenrightbig\n+Cjl\u2032(2.1)\nwhereCiare di\ufb00erentiable functions of ( x,t). The inclusion of Ciis needed in the next\nsection in order that the result of this section can be extended to t he quasilinear system.\nWe give conditions for the linear system to have a unique global solutio n. The conditions\nare most naturally given in terms of the eigenvalues of the matrix Bi, which have the form\n\u03bbR\ni=ci+ui, \u03bbL\ni=ci\u2212ui,\nwhere\nui=/radical\uf8ecig\nc2\ni+aibi.\nThese eigenvalues are real if\nc2\ni+aibi>0, x\u2208(0,1), t >0, i= 1,...,n. (2.2)\nIn this case,\n\u03bbR\ni(x,t)>0, \u03bbL\ni(x,t)< \u03bbR\ni(x,t) (2.3)\nand the system is hyperbolic. Under the condition (2.2), we show tha t the linear system has\na unique solution if\n\u03bbL\ni(0,t)<0, \u03bbL\ni(1,t)<0, i= 1,...,n\nwhich is equivalent to\naibi>0, t\u22650, i= 1,...,n. (2.4)\natx= 0,1 only. It needs not hold for x\u2208(0,1).\nTheorem 2.1 Assume that the functions ai,bi,ci,fi,gi,AiandCiare independent of\n(Pi,Qi). Suppose that these functions and the initial and boundary f unctions PI\ni,QI\ni,PB\ni,\nQB\niall have bounded \ufb01rst-order derivatives. Suppose also that ai>0,Ai>0and that the\nconditions (2.2) and (2.4) hold. Then, for any T >0there is a unique solution in a bounded\nsubset of the space C([0,1]\u00d7[0,T],R2n)to the linear system (1.13) with the initial and\nboundary conditions given by (1.5)\u2013(1.8), (1.10)\u2013(1.12), and (2.1).\n6\nProof. We \ufb01rst show that the system has a unique solution for 0 < t < \u03b4for some \u03b4 >0.\nThe proof is based on the method of characteristics and a \ufb01xed poin t principle. For systems\nde\ufb01ned on only one branch with boundary conditions of the forms of (1.6) or (1.7), this is a\nstandard approach. In our case, special care is needed to handle the junction conditions.\nConsider the i-th branch. From any point ( \u03be,\u03c4) on the left, right, and lower boundary of\nthe rectangle D=: [0,1]\u00d7[0,T], we construct the left-going and right-going characteristic\ncurvesx=xL\ni(t;\u03be,\u03c4) andx=xR\ni(t;\u03be,\u03c4) by\ndxL\ni\ndt=\u03bbL\ni/parenleftbig\nxL\ni,t/parenrightbig\n, xL\ni(\u03c4) =\u03be,\ndxR\ni\ndt=\u03bbR\ni/parenleftbig\nxR\ni,t/parenrightbig\n, xR\ni(\u03c4) =\u03be,\nrespectively, where \u03bbL\niand\u03bbR\niare the two eigenvalues of the matrix Bi. By the uniqueness of\nsolutions to these di\ufb00erential equations, a left-going (resp. right -going) characteristic curve\ncannot intersect with another left-going (resp. right-going) cha racteristic curve. Let XL\niand\nXR\nibe the right-most left-going and left-most right-going character istic curves,\nx=xL\ni(t;1,0) andx=xR\ni(t;0,0)\nstarting from the lower boundary of D, respectively. It can be shown from (2.3) that the\ntwo curves can have at most one intersection. Let tibe the value of tat the intersection.\nIf the two curves do not intersect in D, we simply de\ufb01ne ti=T. By condition (2.4), XL\ni\ncannot reach the right vertical line x= 1 at any t >0, and by \u03bbR\ni>0,XR\nicannot reach the\nvertical line x= 0 at any t >0. Thus, the rectangle Di=: [0,1]\u00d7[0,ti] can be divided into\nthree parts\nDi=DL\ni\u222aDC\ni\u222aDR\ni,\nwhereDL\niis between the vertical line x= 0 and the characteristic curve XR\ni,DC\niis between\nthe two characteristic curves, and DR\niis between XL\niandx= 1.\ni\nt\nR\n\ni\nX\nL\n\ni\nX\n\n1\nx\nL\n\ni\nD\n\nC\n\ni\nD\nR\n\ni\nD\nt\n\nFigure 2: Three parts of Di\n7\nWe show that there is a \u03b4i\u2264tisuch that the solution ( Pi,Qi) for the i-th branch exists in\nthe restriction of Dito the strip {0\u2264t\u2264\u03b4i}.\nFirst, observe that the initial conditions alone determine the solutio n completely in the\ncentral region DC\ni. This follows from the theory of \ufb01rst-order linear hyperbolic syste ms and\nthe fact that from any point ( x,t)\u2208DC\ni, the two characteristic curves, followed backwards,\nmust land on the horizontal line t= 0. (The latter is a consequence of (2.3).) To extend\nthe solution to other parts of Di, we make a change of unknowns and derive a set of integral\nequations. Note that lR\ni=:/parenleftbig\n\u2212\u03bbL\ni,ai/parenrightbig\nandlL\ni=:/parenleftbig\n\u2212\u03bbR\ni,ai/parenrightbig\nare the left eigenvectors of Bi\ncorresponding to \u03bbR\niand\u03bbL\ni, respectively. Introduce new unknowns\nri=lR\niUi\u2261 \u2212\u03bbL\niPi+aiQi, si=lL\niUi\u2261 \u2212\u03bbR\niPi+aiQi. (2.5)\nThe system (1.13) can be written in terms of riandsiby multiplying the left eigenvectors\nto (1.14) and substituting in\nPi=1\n2ui(ri\u2212si), Qi=1\n2uiai/parenleftbig\n\u03bbR\niri\u2212\u03bbL\nisi/parenrightbig\n. (2.6)\nThis results in the equations\n\u2202R\niri=FR\ni(x,t,ri,si), \u2202L\nisi=FL\ni(x,t,ri,si), (2.7)\nwhere\n\u2202R\ni=\u2202\n\u2202t+\u03bbR\ni\u2202\n\u2202x, \u2202L\ni=\u2202\n\u2202t+\u03bbL\ni\u2202\n\u2202x, (2.8)\nand\nFR\ni(x,t,ri,si) =lR\niFi+/parenleftbig\n\u2202R\nilR\ni/parenrightbig\nUi, FL\ni(x,t,ri,si) =lL\niFi+/parenleftbig\n\u2202L\nilL\ni/parenrightbig\nUi.(2.9)\n(A di\ufb00erential operator acting on a vector means that it acts on ea ch component of the\nvector.) Let ( x,t)\u2208Di. We integrate the \ufb01rst equation of (2.7) along the right-going\ncharacteristic curve xR(t;\u03be,\u03c4) which passes through ( x,t) and reaches the left or lower\nboundary of Diat (\u03be,\u03c4). It can be shown that for ( x,t)\u2208DC\ni\u222aDR\ni,\u03c4= 0, and for\n(x,t)\u2208DL\ni,\u03be= 0. In the former case, we obtain\nri(x,t) =rI\ni(\u03be)+/integraldisplayt\n0FR\ni/parenleftbig\nxR\ni(t\u2032;\u03be,0),t\u2032,ri,si/parenrightbig\ndt\u2032(2.10)\nIn the latter case, we have\nri(x,t) =ri(0,\u03c4)+/integraldisplayt\n\u03c4FR\ni/parenleftbig\nxR\ni(t\u2032;0,\u03c4),t\u2032,ri,si/parenrightbig\ndt\u2032. (2.11)\n8\nSimilarly, by integrating the second equation of (2.7) along the left-g oing characteristic curve\nxL\ni(t;\u03be,\u03c4) that passes through both ( x,t) and (\u03be,\u03c4) (which is on either the right or lower\nboundary of Di), the equations are\nsi(x,t) =sI\ni(\u03be)+/integraldisplayt\n0FL\ni/parenleftbig\nxL\ni(t\u2032;\u03be,0),t\u2032,ri,si/parenrightbig\ndt\u2032(2.12)\nif (x,t)\u2208DL\ni\u222aDC\niand\nsi(x,t) =si(1,\u03c4)+/integraldisplayt\n\u03c4FL\ni/parenleftbig\nxL\ni(t\u2032;1,\u03c4),t\u2032,ri,si/parenrightbig\ndt\u2032(2.13)\nif (x,t)\u2208DR\ni. These are the integral equations we need.\nFor any\u03b4i\u2264tiwe useDL\ni,\u03b4i,DC\ni,\u03b4iandDR\ni,\u03b4ito denote the restrictions of DL\ni,DC\niandDR\ni\nto the strip {0\u2264t\u2264\u03b4i}, respectively. First, consider the case where the end of the bran ch is\nan external end. We discuss the case of a left end only, the case of a right end can be treated\nsimilarly. If the boundary condition is given by (1.6), we de\ufb01ne \u02c6 si=si/\u03b5where\u03b5 <1 is any\nconstant. Using the \ufb01rst equation of (2.6) in the integral equation s (2.11) and (2.12),\n/parenleftbigg\nri(x,t)\n\u02c6si(x,t)/parenrightbigg\n=\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed2ui(0,\u03c4)PB\ni(\u03c4)+\u03b5\u02c6si(0,\u03c4)+/integraldisplayt\n\u03c4FR\ni/parenleftbig\nxR\ni(t\u2032;0,\u03c4),t\u2032,ri,\u03b5\u02c6si/parenrightbig\ndt\u2032\n1\n\u03b5sI\ni(\u03be)+1\n\u03b5/integraldisplayt\n0FL\ni/parenleftbig\nxL\ni(t\u2032;\u03be,0),t\u2032,ri,\u03b5\u02c6si/parenrightbig\ndt\u2032\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8.\n(2.14)\nThis is a \ufb01xed point equation for ( ri,\u02c6si) if we de\ufb01ne the right hand side as a mapping of an\noperator Kon (ri,\u02c6si) in a bounded subset of C/parenleftbig\nDL\ni,\u03b4i\u222aDC\ni,\u03b4i,R2/parenrightbig\n. In a standard approach,\nit can be shown that Kis a contraction mapping if \u03b4iis su\ufb03ciently small. Hence, the \ufb01xed\npoint exists and is unique, and the solution ( ri,si) is uniquely extended to DL\ni,\u03b4i\u222aDC\ni,\u03b4i. If\nthe boundary condition is given by (1.7), we de\ufb01ne \u02c6 si=si/\u03b5, where\u03b5 >0 is so small such\nthat\n\u03b5/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle\u03bbL\ni(0,\u03c4)\n\u03bbR\ni(0,\u03c4)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle<1, \u03c4\u2208(0,ti).\nThe \ufb01xed point equation is then\n/parenleftbiggri(x,t)\n\u02c6si(x,t)/parenrightbigg\n=\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed2aiui(0,\u03c4)\n\u03bbR\ni(0,\u03c4)QB\ni(\u03c4)+\u03bbL\ni(0,\u03c4)\n\u03bbR\ni(0,\u03c4)\u03b5\u02c6si(0,\u03c4)+/integraldisplayt\n\u03c4FR\ni/parenleftbig\nxR\ni(t\u2032;0,\u03c4),t\u2032,ri,\u03b5\u02c6si/parenrightbig\ndt\u2032\n1\n\u03b5sI\ni(\u03be)+1\n\u03b5/integraldisplayt\n0FL\ni/parenleftbig\nxL\ni(t\u2032;\u03be,0),t\u2032,ri,\u03b5\u02c6si/parenrightbig\ndt\u2032\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8.\n(2.15)\nBy a similar argument, the solution can again be uniquely extended.\nWe next extend the solution to either DL\ni,\u03b4iorDR\ni,\u03b4iif the end is a branching junction.\nIn this case, we shall extend the solution on all the branches that a re connected to the\n9\nsame junction simultaneously. Let j1,...,j \u03bdbe the incoming and j\u03bd+1,...,j \u00b5the outgoing\nbranches to the junction.

The remaining of the previous paragraph can then be used here\nto give the extension of the solution to the left or right regions for t he branches.\nFinally, if we let \u03b4be the minimum of all \u03b4ioccurring above, we see that \u03b4 >0 and the\nsolution exists and is unique in ( x,t)\u2208D\u03b4=: [0,1]\u00d7[0,\u03b4]. Observe that \u03b4depends only\non the bounds of the system functions ai, etc., the initial and boundary functions PI\ni, etc.,\nand their \ufb01rst-order derivatives in D= [0,1]\u00d7[0,T]. Hence, it is independent of t, and we\ncan extend the solution successively in the time intervals [0 ,\u03b4], [\u03b4,2\u03b4], etc. In this way, the\nsolution is obtained in Din \ufb01nitely many steps.\nWe next derive an estimate of the deviation of solution in term of the d eviations of the\ninitial, boundary and forcing functions.

We need only prove (2.21) for a \u03b4\u2264mini{\u03b4i}, where\u03b4irepresents the constants\noccurring in the proof of Theorem 2.1. This is because for larger \u03b4, we can divide the\ninterval [0 ,\u03b4] into subintervals, each has a length less than min i{\u03b4i}, and apply (2.21) in\neach subinterval. We can then take the maximum on each side of the in equalities to derive\nthe inequality of in [0 ,\u03b4]. In the sequel, DC\n\u03b4,DL\n\u03b4andDR\n\u03b4are the restrictions of DC\ni,DL\niand\nDR\nito the strip {0\u2264t\u2264\u03b4}, respectively.\nBy linearity, U\u2212\u02dcUis the solution of the system with the initial, boundary and forcing\nfunctions PI\ni\u2212\u02dcPI\ni,QI\ni\u2212\u02dcQI\ni,PB\ni\u2212\u02dcPB\ni,QB\ni\u2212\u02dcQB\ni,fi\u2212\u02dcfi,gi\u2212\u02dcgiandCi\u2212\u02dcCi. Letri, \u02c6ri,si,\n\u02c6sibe de\ufb01ned as in the proof of Theorem 2.1, corresponding to U\u2212\u02dcU. We show that these\nquantities have upper bounds in the form of the right hand side of (2 .21) inDC\n\u03b4,DL\n\u03b4and\nDR\n\u03b4.\nInDC\n\u03b4, (2.10) and (2.12) hold. Notice that the functions FR\niandFL\niare linear in ri, and\nsi.

Since the\nboth cases are similar, we will only treat the case where the left end is an external. The\nintegral equations to be used are (2.14) or (2.15) according to the type of the boundary\ncondition.

The conclusion of the lemma follows now from\n(2.6).\n3 The quasilinear system\nIn this section, we study the quasilinear system where the coe\ufb03cien tsai,bi,ci,fi,gi,Aiand\nCidepend on both ( x,t) and (Pi,Qi). Under certain conditions, we show that the system\nhas a unique local solution. We then present a theorem on the contin uity of dependence of\nthe solution on initial, boundary and forcing function.\nThebasicideaintheproofoftheexistenceofsolutionistoconstruc taniterativesequence.\nSubstituting any vector function ( pi,qi) for (Pi,Qi) inai, etc., the system becomes linear.\nThus, we can use Theorem 2.1 to get a solution ( Pi,Qi). This de\ufb01nes a mapping Sfrom\nu=: (pi,qi) toU=: (Pi,Qi), and the solution for the quasilinear system is a \ufb01xed point of\nS. If there is a subset of a Banach space that is invariant under S, then, we can construct a\nsequence\nuk+1=Suk, k= 0,1,....\nIn the case where the limit exists and is unique, it gives rise to \ufb01xed poin t ofS. This is our\napproach in this section.\nIn this approach, conditions (2.2) and (2.4) are repeatedly used. O ne might want to\nimpose them for all the values of the variables. This would give the exis tence and uniqueness\nfor the global solution, as in the case of the linear system. However , such a requirement is\n15\nso restrictive that even the original system (1.4) cannot meet it. T herefore, we will impose\nthem only for t= 0, and obtain the local solution for the quasilinear system.\nTheorem 3.1 Assume that the initial and boundary functions PI\ni,QI\ni,PB\ni,QB\niand the\nsystem functions ai,bi,ci,fi,gi,AiandCiall have continuous \ufb01rst-order derivatives with\nrespect to each variable. Suppose that aiis positive and Aihas a positive lower bound for all\nthe values of their arguments, and that conditions (2.2)\u2013(2 .4) hold at t= 0. Suppose also\nthat the initial functions PI\ni,QI\nisatisfy any relevant boundary conditions at t= 0. Then,\nfor some \u03b4 >0, there is a unique solution for 0\u2264t < \u03b4to the quasilinear system (1.13) with\nthe initial and boundary conditions given by (1.5)\u2013(1.8), ( 2.1), and (1.10)\u2013(1.12).\nProof. We \ufb01rst consider the simpler case where UI=:/parenleftbig\nPI,QI/parenrightbig\n= 0. Let v={vi},\nvi= (pi,qi) be a family of vector functions (not necessarily constitutes a solu tion) that\nsatisfy the initial and boundary conditions. Substitute vforUin the functions ai,bi,ci,fi,\ngi,AiandCi. Then, the system becomes linear and we can invoke Theorem 2.1 to o btain\na solution Uto the linear system. This de\ufb01nes a mapping S:v/mapsto\u2192U. A solution to the\nquasilinear system is then a \ufb01xed point of S. We will choose a subset X\u03b4,M0of a Banach\nspace such that (1) SX\u03b4,M0\u2282X\u03b4,M0, and (2) Sis contracting in X\u03b4,M0. For any scalar\nor vector function f\u2208Ck(D\u03b4), let|f|k,\u03b4denote the maximum norm of all the k-th order\nderivatives of finD\u03b4. (Iffis a vector function, |f|k,\u03b4= max i/braceleft\uf8ecig\n|fi|k,\u03b4/braceright\uf8ecig\n.) LetCB(D\u03b4,R2n)\ndenote the subset of the vector-valued functions in C(D\u03b4,R2n) that satisfy the initial and\nboundary conditions. We seek X\u03b4,M0in the form\nX\u03b4,M0=/braceleft\uf8ecig\nv\u2208CB/parenleftbig\nD\u03b4,R2n/parenrightbig\n:|v|0,\u03b4\u2264M0,|v|1,\u03b4\u2264M1/braceright\uf8ecig\n(3.1)\nwhereM0is an arbitrary positive constant and M1is a constant to be determined. Note\nthat by the vanishing initial condition, for any M1,|U|1,\u03b4\u2264M1implies|U|0,\u03b4\u2264M1\u03b4. Hence,\nfor anyM0, we can ensure |U|0,\u03b4\u2264M0by reducing \u03b4. It remains, therefore, only to show\nthat for M1su\ufb03ciently large and \u03b4su\ufb03ciently small, |v|1,\u03b4\u2264M1implies|Sv|1,\u03b4\u2264M1.\nThroughout this proof, we use Mto represent any positive constant that may depend on M1\nbut is otherwise independent of vand\u03b4, and use \u02dcMfor any constant that is independent of\nM1,vand\u03b4. The values of Mor\u02dcMin di\ufb00erent occurrences need not be equal.\nLetU=Svand letriandsibe de\ufb01ned by (2.5). On each branch, we show that\nmax{|(ri)x|,|(si)x|,} \u2264M1 (3.2)\nand\nmax{|(ri)t|,|(si)t|} \u2264M1 (3.3)\n16\ninDC\n\u03b4,DL\n\u03b4andDR\n\u03b4ifM1is large and \u03b4is small. (Recall that DC\n\u03b4etc. are the intersections\nDC\ni\u2229D\u03b4etc., respectively.) In fact, only (3.2) needs to be shown. To see th is, \ufb01rst ob-\nserve that the vanishing initial condition and the compatibility of the in itial and boundary\nconditions gives\nmax\ni/braceleft\uf8ecig/vextendsingle/vextendsinglePB\ni/vextendsingle/vextendsingle\nC[0,\u03b4],/vextendsingle/vextendsingleQB\ni/vextendsingle/vextendsingle\nC[0,\u03b4]/braceright\uf8ecig\n\u2264M\u03b4.\nHence, we obtain from Lemma 2.1 with \u02dcU= 0 that\n|U|0,\u03b4\u2264M\u03b4. (3.4)\nFrom (2.7) and (2.9), there are constants \u02dcMandMsuch that\n/vextendsingle/vextendsingle\u2202R\niri/vextendsingle/vextendsingle\u2264/vextendsingle/vextendsinglelR\niFi/vextendsingle/vextendsingle+/vextendsingle/vextendsingle\u2202R\nilR\ni/vextendsingle/vextendsingle|Ui| \u2264\u02dcM+M\u03b4,\n/vextendsingle/vextendsingle\u2202L\nisi/vextendsingle/vextendsingle\u2264/vextendsingle/vextendsinglelL\niFi/vextendsingle/vextendsingle+/vextendsingle/vextendsingle\u2202L\nilL\ni/vextendsingle/vextendsingle|Ui| \u2264\u02dcM+M\u03b4(3.5)\nfor eachi= 1,...,n. Hence, (3.3) follows from (3.2), (3.5) and the de\ufb01nition of \u2202L\niand\u2202R\ni\nin (2.8). We also note that (2.6) and (3.5) imply\n/vextendsingle/vextendsingle\u2202R\niUi/vextendsingle/vextendsingle\n0,\u03b4\u2264\u02dcM+M\u03b4,/vextendsingle/vextendsingle\u2202R\niUi/vextendsingle/vextendsingle\n0,\u03b4\u2264\u02dcM+M\u03b4 (3.6)\nfor alli.

As a followup to our previous work, [1, 2, 3] we\napproach this problem by considering the translocation pro perties\nof primitive molecular machines, which capture basic featu res of ri-\nbosomal/messenger RNA interactions, while operating unde r prebi-\notic conditions. Our model consists of a short one-dimensio nal chain\nof charged particles(rRNA antecedent) interacting with a p olymer\n(mRNA antecedent) via electrostatic forces. The chain is su bject to\nexternal forcing that causes it to move along the polymer whi ch is\n\ufb01xed in a quasi one dimensional geometry. Our numerical and a n-\nalytic studies of statistical properties of random chain/p olymer po-\ntentials suggest that, under very general conditions, a dyn amics is\nattained in which the chain moves along the polymer in steps o f three\n1\nmonomers. By adjusting the model in order to consider presen t day\ngenetic sequences, we show that the above property is enhanc ed for\ncoding regions. Intergenic sequences display a behavior cl oser to the\nrandom situation. We argue that this dynamical property cou ld be\none of the underlying causes for the three base codon structu re of the\ngenetic code\n1 Introduction\nThe origin of the genetic code has been a subject of intense resear ch since\nits structure was completely elucidated in the early 1970\u2019s. In subse quent\nyears, the scienti\ufb01c community has produced several theories in o rder to ex-\nplain why the genetic code has this structure. Among these theorie s, the\nmost prominent ones are the stereochemical theory, the frozen -accident the-\nory and the coevolutionary theory [4]-[9]. Roughly speaking, these t heories\ntry to account for the structure of the genetic code by looking at the in-\nteractions between codons and amino acids, the biosynthetic relat ionships\namong di\ufb00erent amino acids and how the metabolic pathways between them\nhave been selected throughout evolution. Nevertheless, the fac t that all the\ncodons are made up of three nucleotides, has mostly been taken fo r granted\nand barely brought into question.\nOne of the most widely used arguments found in the literature to exp lain\nthe trinucleotide codon structure of the genetic code, was given b y Sidney\nBrenner in 1961 [10, 11]. According to this argument, codons are ma de up of\nthree nucleotides (or bases, for short) because there are 20 am ino acids to be\nspeci\ufb01ed by the genetic information expressed by a 4 letter \u201calphab et\u201d (the\nfour bases A,G,C,U). If codons were composed of only two bases, th ere would\nbe only 16 di\ufb00erent combinations (42), which are not enough to specify for\n20 amino acids. If instead, codons were made up of more than three bases,\nthere would be at least 256 combinations (44), and these are too many for\nonly 20 amino acids. Hence, less than three bases per codon are not enough,\nand more than three would imply an excessive degeneration of the co de. The\nresult coming out from this argument is that three bases per codon is the\noptimal \u201cbit of information\u201d that can be used in order to specify for the 20\ndi\ufb00erent amino acids by means of a 4 letter \u201calphabet\u201d.\nThe above argument, however, does not constitute an explanatio n by\n2\nitself, mainly because it only moves the question of \u201cwhy three?\u201d to t he\nquestions of \u201cwhy twenty?\u201d or for that matter \u201cwhy four?\u201d. The re is no\nreason for the genetic information to codify for only 20 amino acids s ince\nliving organisms use more than those speci\ufb01ed by the genetic code [12 ]. In\naddition, this argument assumes that all the codons must have the same\nlength (number of bases), even though more e\ufb03cient codes can be obtained\nbyallowing thelengthofthecodonstovary[13]. Finally, giventhat20amino\nacids have to be speci\ufb01ed by using 4 di\ufb00erent bases, Brenner\u2019s argu ment\nleads to the simplest code that might be thought of. But even in such a case,\nsimplicity has to be accounted for as a relevant criterium.\nIn this work we address the question of the origin of the three-bas e codon\nstructure of the genetic code from a dynamical point of view. We co nsider\na simple molecular machine model which captures some of the principal fea-\ntures of the interaction between primitive realizations of the riboso me and\nof the mRNA. Our main objective is to present a dynamical scenario, com-\npatible with prebiotic conditions, of how the triplet structure of the genetic\ncode could have arisen. The model we propose is a follow up of the one\nintroduced by Aldana, Cocho and Mart\u00b4 \u0131nez-Mekler [1, 2, 3] and is co nsistent\nwith the current evidence suggesting the \u201cRNA world\u201d hypothesi1s [14]. In\nthis scheme the crucial molecules involved in the prebiotic and protob iotic\nprocesses, that eventually led to codi\ufb01cation and translation mech anisms of\nthe genetic information, were RNA related.q\nIn our model, based on the setup depicted in Fig. 1, a short one-\ndimensional polymer composed of Mmonomers interacts with a much longer\none, via electrostatic forces. In order to avoid confusion, from n ow on we will\nrefer to the short polymer as \u201cthe chain\u201d, and to the long polymer s imply\nas \u201cthe polymer\u201d. The electrostatic interaction between the chain and the\npolymer is due to the presence of electric charges, or multipolar mom ents, in\nthe monomers of both the chain and the polymer.\nThe charges ofthe monomers ofthechain andof thepolymer areas signed\nat random following a uniform distribution. Therefore, the resulting chain-\npolymer interaction potential has a random pro\ufb01le. The chain is allowe d to\nmovealongthepolymer, butisconstrainedtoremainata\ufb01xedperpe ndicular\ndistance \u03c3from it. Consequently, transport is one-dimensional. One of our\nmain results is to show that under very general conditions, a dynam ics is\nattained in which the chain moves along the polymer in e\ufb00ective \u201csteps \u201d\nwhose mean length is three monomers. We argue that this dynamical feature\n3\nq 1q 2q 3 q N . . .Fex p1 pM . . .x\n\u03c3\n..\nFigure 1: The molecular machine model. A one dimensional chain compos ed\nofMmonomers interacts with a one dimensional polymer, Nmonomers\nin length. The charges {pi}along the chain, as well as the charges {qj}\nof the polymer are independent random variables. The chain is at a \ufb01x ed\nperpendicular distance \u03c3from the polymer, but can move along the polymer.\nxis the horizontal position of the chain with respect to the polymer.\nmay be one of the underlying causes of the three base codon struc ture of the\ngenetic code.\nThis paper is organized as follows: section 2 describes in detail the mo del\nand the assumptions introduced. In section 3 we recall some statis tical as-\npects of our previous analysis [1, 2, 3] of the random interaction po tentials\nbetween the chain and the polymer for the simplest case in which the f ormer\nis composed of just one particle ( M= 1). We exhibit numerically that, even\nin this simple case, the mean distance \u00afdbetween consecutive minima along\nthe interaction potential is very close to three: \u00afd\u223c3 (taking the monomer\nlength as spatial unit). After retrieving the analytical expression for this\ndistance [1], we then look into the probability Pm(d) of two neighboring po-\ntential minima being separated by a distance d. Subindex mrefers to the\nnumber of di\ufb00erent types of monomers in the polymer and in the chain . This\nprobability function shows that, even though the mean distance \u00afdis close to\nthree, the most probable distance between consecutive minima is d\u2217= 2 for\nm >2. In section 4 the monomer charges along the polymer are assigned\nin correspondence with protein-coding regions of the genome of re al organ-\nisms (e.g. Drosophila orE. coli) instead of at random. For this case, the\nprobability function Pm(d) is modi\ufb01ed so that not only the mean distance is\n\u00afd\u223c3, but also the most probable one happens to be d\u2217= 3.\n4\nIn section 5 we introduce the more realistic case M >1, which takes\ninto account the fact that the ribosome is not a point particle, that it has\nspatial structure and presents several simultaneous contact p oints between\nits own rRNA and the mRNA polymer. For small chain lengths ( M\u223c10),\ntheprobability distribution Pm(d)is indicative ofwide \ufb02uctuationsandhasa\nformstrongly dependent ontheparticular assignment ofcharges inthechain.\nOne ofour main \ufb01ndings is that for such chains themost likely con\ufb01gur ations\nare those in which both, the mean distance \u00afdand the most probable one d\u2217\nare equal to three, even when the monomer charges along the polymer and\nthe chain are assigned at random . In section 6 we analyze the dynamics\nresulting from the model when an external force is pulling the chain, forcing\nit to move as a rigid object along the polymer. The power spectrum of the\nvelocity of the chain reveals that, under some very general circum stances, for\nsmall chain lengths ( M\u223c10), there is a sharp periodicity in the dynamics\nof the system, with a slowing down of the velocity of the chain every t hree\nmonomers. Finally, section 7 is devoted to the discussion of the resu lts and\ntheir relevance to the origin of the genetic code.\n2 The model\nThe model we propose consists of a chain of Mmonomers interacting with\na very long polymer composed of Nmonomers, with N\u2192 \u221e(see Fig.1).\nThe chain is constrained to remain at a given distance \u03c3perpendicular to\nthe polymer and is allowed to move in along the polymer, we shall de\ufb01ne\nxas its position in this direction relative to the polymer. We will denote\nthe monomer charges in the chain and in the polymer by {pi}and{qj},\nrespectively. Weshouldmentionthatby\u201ccharge\u201dwedonotnecess arily mean\nCoulomb charge. Both {pi}and{qj}could be dipolar moments, induced\npolarizabilities, or similar quantities resulting from electrostatic inter actions\nbetween chain monomers and polymer monomers with potentials of th e form\n1/r\u03b1, where\u03b1characterizes the \u201ccharge\u201d type.\nWe will assume that all the monomers in the chain, and separately, all\nthe monomers in the polymer, are of the same nature, namely, all of them\nare either Coulomb charges, or dipolar moments, or polarizable molec ules,\netc. In addition, taking into account that in the origin of life condition s the\ngenetic molecules were not yet likely to convey any structured infor mation,\n5\nwe will consider the charges {pi}and{qj}to be discrete independent random\nvariables, acquiring one of the mdi\ufb00erent values \u03be1, \u03be2, ..., \u03be mwith the\nsame probability. Hence, the probability function P(q) for both, the {pi}\nand{qj}variables, will be\nP(q) =1\nmm/summationdisplay\nj=1\u03b4(q\u2212\u03bej) (1)\nwhere\u03b4(q) is the Dirac delta function. In general, in this work we will take\nthe values \u03be1, \u03be2, ..., \u03be mas integers. Parameter mrepresents the number of\ndi\ufb00erent types of monomers from which the polymer and the chain ar e made\nof. For the case of real genetic sequences m= 4, but we will not restrict the\nvalue ofmto be 4.\nAll the monomers will have the same length L, which we take as the\nspatial unit of measure: L= 1. We also assume the charge in each of the\nmonomers to be uniformly distributed along the length L, so that the charge\ndensity\u03bbj(x) in the jth-monomer of the polymer, for example, is a constant\nwhose value is \u03bbj(x) =qj/L. Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning that the\ndynamics of the model does not depend strongly on the particular s hape\nof the monomer charge density \u03bbj(x), as long it is a smooth function of x\n(\u201csmooth\u201d in the sense of di\ufb00erentiability).\nWith the preceding assumptions, the interaction potential Vij(x) between\nthe ith-monomer in the chain and the jth-monomer in the polymer is giv en\nby\nVij(x) =Kpiqj/integraldisplayx+i\nx+i\u22121/integraldisplayj\nj\u22121dx\u2032dx\u2032\u2032\n[(x\u2032\u2212x\u2032\u2032)2+\u03c32]\u03b1/2(2)\nwhereKis a constant whose value depends on the unit system used to\nmeasure the physical quantities. In the above expression, Lhas already been\nset equal to 1. Parameter \u03b1characterizes the kind of interaction between\nthe chain and the polymer: \u03b1= 1 corresponds to an ion-ion interaction,\n\u03b1= 2 represents an ion-dipole interaction, and so forth. Note that t his\nparameter does not depend on the indices iandj, since all the monomers\nin the chain are of the same nature and those in the polymer are them selves\nof the same nature, di\ufb00ering from each other only in the value of the charge\nthey contain. The overall interaction potential V\u03b1\n\u03c3(x) between the whole\n6\nchain and the entire polymer is given by the superposition of the individ ual\npotentials Vij(x):\nV\u03b1\n\u03c3(x) =M/summationdisplay\ni=1N/summationdisplay\nj=1Vij(x) (3)\nEquations (2) and (3) establish the type of random potentials we will be\nconsidering. Our \ufb01rst aim is to analyze the spatial structure of the se poten-\ntials, giving their statistical characterization. This will be done in the three\nfollowing sections. Subsequently, we will consider the dynamics of th e chain\nmoving along the polymer interacting with it by means of a random pote n-\ntial, subject to an external driving force and seek under what con ditions, if\nany, transport in \u201csteps\u201d of three monomers can be achieved.\n3 Random potentials: M= 1\nLet us start with the simplest case M= 1, in which the chain consists of\njust one monomer. We will refer to this case as the \u201csingle-monomer -chain\u201d\ncase, and to the chain simply as \u201cthe particle\u201d. The reason to consid er this\nsimple situation is twofold: on one hand, it is useful in order to introdu ce\nthe relevant ideas behind the model. On the other hand, it is simple eno ugh\nas to obtain exact analytical results in a more o less straightforwar d way.\nIn previous work we have already analyzed some statistical proper ties of\nthe random potentials given by expressions (2) and (3) for the cas eM= 1\n[1, 2, 3]. After a short review of some of those results we center ou r attention\non the probability distribution Pm(d).\nThe overall particle-polymer interaction potential is given by\nV\u03b1\n\u03c3(x) =N/summationdisplay\nj=1qj/integraldisplayx+1\nx/integraldisplayj\nj\u22121dx\u2032dx\u2032\u2032\n[(x\u2032\u2212x\u2032\u2032)2+\u03c32]\u03b1/2(4)\nNote that in the previous expression we have set Kp1, the only charge in\nthe chain, equal to one. Fig.2 shows three graphs of the potential V\u03b1\n\u03c3(x) for\n\u03c3= 0.5 and di\ufb00erent values of the parameter \u03b1. To generate these graphs,\nthe following probability function for the charges {qj}was used:\n7\nP(q) =1\n63/summationdisplay\n\u00b5=\u22123\u03b4(q\u2212\u00b5) (5)\nnamely, each one of the variables {qj}acquired one of the six di\ufb00erent values\n{\u00b11,\u00b12,\u00b13}with probability 1 /6 (m= 6). In Fig.2, the random realization\nof the charges {qj}along the polymer was the same for the three graphs.\nAs can be seen from this \ufb01gure, the distribution of maxima and minima\nalong the potential does not change by varying the value of the par ameter\n\u03b1, in the sense that all the maxima and minima remain essentially at the\nsame positions. What occurs as \u03b1takes larger and larger values is that the\npotential becomes a step-like function.\nFig.3presentsananalogoussituation, butnowkeeping \u03b1constant( \u03b1= 2)\nand varying \u03c3. The behavior of the potential is similar to the previous case:\nthe potential becomes a step-like function as \u03c3decreases and the positions\nof the maxima and minima are not appreciably modi\ufb01ed.\nTheaboveconsiderationsexhibit thatforsmallvaluesof \u03c3, say0< \u03c3\u22641,\nthe distribution of maxima and minima along the potential is entirely det er-\nmined by the distribution of charges along the polymer and is independ ent of\nthe particular values acquired by the parameters \u03b1and\u03c3. Therefore, in or-\nder to \ufb01nd out the distribution of maxima and minima along the interact ion\npotential, it is possible to substitute the continuous random potent ial given\nby expressions (2) and (3), by the equivalent step-like potential d e\ufb01ned by\nV(x) =N/summationdisplay\nj=1Vj[H(x\u2212(j\u22121))\u2212H(x\u2212j)] (6)\nwhereH(x) is the Heaviside function1, andVjis a random variable whose\nvalue is directly proportional to the charge qjof the jth-monomer in the\npolymer:\nVj=Kp1qj (7)\nwherep1is the charge of the particle (the only monomer in the chain).\nSince the random charges {qj}are statistically independent, so are the\n{Vj}.

Note that as\n\u03b1increases, the potential becomes a step-like function, but the po sitions of\nthe maxima and minima do not change. Also note that there are 33 pot en-\ntial minima distributed along 100 monomers. Therefore the mean dist ance\nbetween consecutive minima is \u00afd= 100/33 = 3.03.\n9\n0 20 40 60 80 100\n(c) \u221210\u2212505100 20 40 60 80 100\n(b)\u221210\u2212505100 20 40 60 80 100\n(a)\u221210\u221250510\nV  (x)\u03c3\u03b1\nx\nFigure 3: Particle-polymer interaction potential for \u03b1= 2 and di\ufb00erent\nvalues of \u03c3.

As before, the\ndistribution of maxima and minima does not change when \u03c3\u21920. Note that\nin this case there are 34 minima in the interval [0 ,100]. Therefore, the mean\ndistance between neighboring minima is \u00afd= 100/34 = 2.94.\n10\n/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0\n/1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1V(x)\nx\nFigure 4: In a one dimensional potential, the dynamics is determined b y\nthe distribution of maxima and minima. If a molecule is moving along the\npotential and is subject to an external force, it will spend more tim e in the\npotential minima thaninthe maxima. This kind ofmotioncan beconsider ed\nas if the molecule were \u201cjumping\u201d from one minimum to the next.\nbetween consecutive potential minima. This probability function give s im-\nportant information concerning the dynamics of the system. If so me external\nforce is acting on the particle (or the chain), forcing it to move in one di-\nrection (right or left) along the polymer, the particle will spend more time\nin the energy minima than in the maxima. Such a movement may be inter-\npreted by considering the particle as \u201cjumping\u201d from one minimum to t he\nnext (see Fig.4). It is worth noticing that the mean distance betwee n con-\nsecutive minima in the potentials shown in Fig.2 and Fig.3 is nearly three.\nIn Fig.2 there are 33 minima distributed among 100 monomers, and con -\nsequently the mean distance between consecutive minima in this case is\n\u00afd= 100/33\u22433.03. Analogously, the mean distance between neighboring\nminima in Fig.3 is \u00afd= 100/34\u22432.94. Therefore, it is expected that in its\nmotion along the polymer, the velocity of the particle will slow down, on\naverage, every three monomers, being momentarily \u201ctrapped\u201d in e ach of the\npotential minima.\nBy using the step-like limit, in reference [1] we have shown that the me an\ndistance \u00afdbetween consecutive potential minima for a long polymer (the\n11\nd\nd.\n(a)\n(b).\n.\nFigure 5: In the step-like limit, the probability function Pm(d) can be\ncalculated by counting all the possible con\ufb01gurations like the one sho wn in\nthis \ufb01gure. (a) Two minima, one at Vjand the other at Vj+dare separated by\na distance d, with no other minima in between.

The distance dwill be measured between the mid points\nof the two minima.\n12\nlarge N limit) is given by\n\u00afd=6m\n2m\u22121(8)\nwheremis the number of di\ufb00erent monomer types. The above equation\nshows that the mean distance \u00afdis always between 3 and 4, and approaches\n3 asymptotically as m\u2192 \u221e. In particular, for m= 4 (the biological value)\nwe have \u00afd\u22433.43.\nIn order to characterize the \ufb02uctuations around the mean distan ce\u00afd, it\nis useful to compute the probability distribution function Pm(d), which we\nrecall, gives the probability of two consecutive minima being separate d by a\ndistance dwhen there are mdi\ufb00erent types of monomers. In the step-like\nlimit, this computation is carried out by counting all the con\ufb01guration s of\nthe step-like variables {Vj}in which there are two minima, one at Vjand the\nother atVj+d, with no other minima in between. The situation is illustrated\nin Fig.5a. Since in the step-like limit the interaction potential is constan t\nalong every monomer, we will adopt the convention to measure the d istance\ndbetween two adjacent minima from the mid point of the \ufb01rst minimum to\nthe mid point of the second one, as illustrated in Fig.5b. With the above\nconvention, the resulting distances dcan only acquire integer or half-integer\nvalues. For a \ufb01nite number mof di\ufb00erent charges, the explicit calculation of\nthe probability function Pm(d) consists mainly on counting con\ufb01gurations,\nthough conceptually straightforward, it involves a considerable am ount of\nalgebra. Here we present the \ufb01nal expressions:\nPm(d) =6\n2m\u22121d\u22122/summationdisplay\nk=02k+1\nmk+d+2Nm(d\u2212k) (9)\nifdis integer: d= 2,3,4,..., and\nPm(d) =12\n2m\u22121d\u2032\u22122/summationdisplay\nk=02k+1\nmk+d\u2032+3Nm(d\u2032\u2212k) (10)\nifdis half-integer: d= 5/2, d= 7/2, d= 9/2,..., whered\u2032=Int[d]. In\nthe above expressions, Nm(d) is a polynomial whose degree and coe\ufb03cients\ndepend on m. Form= 2,m= 3 and m= 4 the polynomials are given by\nN2(d) = 1\n13\nN3(d) = 1+2 d+2d2(11)\nN4(d) =\u22122+1\n8/bracketleftBig\n30d+73d2+22d3+3d4/bracketrightBig\nFor the case of m=\u221ewe have also derived a closed expression [15],\nwhich has a much simpler form:\nP\u221e(d) = 32d\n(d+3)!/parenleftBig\nd2+d\u22122/parenrightBig\n(12)\nThe preceding distributions are plotted in Fig.6. It can be seen from\nthis \ufb01gure that the most probable distance d\u2217between consecutive potential\nminima is d\u2217= 2, except for the case m= 2 in which d\u2217= 3. Hence,\naccording to the transport mechanism suggested in Fig.4, wheneve r there\nare more than two di\ufb00erent types of monomers, the particle will mov e along\nthe polymer in \u201cjumps\u201d whose mean length is close to three, but whos e most\nprobable length is actually two. The di\ufb00erence between the mean dist ance\n\u00afdand the most probable distance d\u2217is due to the presence of \u201ctails\u201d in the\nprobability function Pm(d). Namely, to the fact that Pm(d) has non zero\nvalues even for large d. Nevertheless, in section 5 we will show that these\n\u201ctails\u201d can be shrunk almost to zero when the chain is made up of more than\none particle ( M >1). This is one of the main results of this paper.\nTo end this section, it is worth mentioning that half-integer distance s be-\ntween two neighboring minima occur when one or both of these minima e x-\ntend over several monomers (see Fig.5b). In these con\ufb01guration s, the charges\nof the adjacent monomers constituting the extended minimum have the same\nvalue. Con\ufb01gurations in which groups of adjacent equally charged m onomers\noccur, are less likely than con\ufb01gurations in which adjacent monomer s have\ndi\ufb00erent charges, andtheformer tendto disappear as mincreases (seeFig.6).\n4 Real genetic sequences: M= 1\nThe charges {qj}along the polymer can be assigned in correspondence with\nthe genetic sequence of an organism, rather than in a random way. The\npurpose of doing so is to \ufb01nd out how the potential minima and maxima\nalong real genetic sequences are distributed, and to compare the resulting\ndistribution with the one corresponding to the random case.

Note that for m >2, the most probable distance d\u2217occurs at\nd\u2217= 2.\n15\nsequences are made out of four di\ufb00erent bases (A, U, C and G) we c onsider\nfour di\ufb00erent possible values \u03be1, \u03be2, \u03be3, \u03be4for the charges {qj}, i.e.m= 4.\nTo proceed further, it is necessary to establish a correspondenc e between the\ncharge values \u03be1,...,\u03be 4and the four bases A, U, C and G. An arbitrary look\nup table is the following:\nbasecharge value\nA \u22122\nU \u22121\nC +1\nG +2(13)\nWiththeabovecorrespondence, ifthejth-baseinagivengenetics equence\nhappens to be A, for example, then the charge of the correspond ing jth-\nmonomer in the polymer will be qj=\u22122.\nFigure Fig.7a shows the probability distribution P4(d) computed numer-\nically by using a Drosophila melanogaster protein-coding sequence, 45500\nbases in length (several genes were concatenated to construct this sequence).\nThe mean distance between consecutive potential minima for this se quence\nis\u00afd\u22433.15 and, as follows from the \ufb01gure, the most probable distance is\nd\u2217= 3. Therefore, in the \u201creal sequence case\u201d not only is the mean dis tance\n\u00afdvery close to 3, but also the most probable distance d\u2217turns out to be 3.\nA comparison of Fig.6c with Fig.7a, shows that for protein-coding gen etic\nsequences, the potential minima along the polymer are more often s eparated\nby three monomers thanin therandom case. When protein-coding s equences\nare used, the value of P4(d) increases at d= 3 and decreases at d= 2.\nThe above behavior does not occur when non-coding sequences of the\ngenome are used for the monomer charge assignment along the poly mer.\nFig.7bshowstheprobabilityfunction P4(d)forthecaseinwhichthemonomer\ncharges areincorrespondence withanintergenic sequence ofthe Drosophila\u2019s\ngenome. The length of the sequence is again 45500 bases. As can be seen\nfrom the \ufb01gure, in this case the probability function P4(d) looks much more\nlike the one obtained in the random case.\nIt is important to remark that the behavior of P4(d) exhibited in Fig.7a\nfor real protein-coding sequences does not depend on the partic ular corre-\nspondence (13) between bases and charge values being used, as lo ng as they\nare of similar order of magnitude and they can allow for an order relat ion.\nThese conditions hold for the four bases A, T, C and G which have cha rges\n16\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n(b)0.00.10.20.3\nP(d)0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n(a)0.00.10.20.3\nP(d)\nd\nd\nFigure 7: Probability function P4(d) computed by assigning the charges\nin the polymer in correspondence with genetic sequences of the Drosophila\nmalanogaster genome.

The order relation is necessary for the interaction potential to\nhave maxima and minima. It is worth asking the e\ufb00ect that changes in t he\norder relation have on the probability function P4(d). There are 24 possi-\nble order relations among the four bases A, T, C, and G (4! permuta tions).\nThe 24 probability functions P4(d) corresponding to these permutations are\nplotted in Fig.8a for Drosophila\u2019s protein-coding sequence. As can be seen\nfrom the \ufb01gure, the probability functions basically overlap, indepen dently\nof the particular order relation between the bases, with a peak at d\u2217= 3.\nThe invariance of P4(d) under base permutations also holds for non-coding\nsequences as is shown in Fig. 8.b., where d\u2217= 2 for intergenic sequences of\nDrosophila Drosophila\u2019s . This valueof d\u2217suggests that non-coding sequences\nbehave as random structures.\nThe \u201cpeaking at d\u2217= 3\u201d of the probability function P4(d) seems to be a\ngeneral characteristic associated with the protein-coding seque nces of living\norganisms, not only with Drosophila . In Fig.9 we show the probability func-\ntions obtained from protein-coding sequences of di\ufb00erent organis ms, and in\nall the cases the probability functions present their highest value a td\u2217= 3\n(the mean distance \u00afdis also very close to 3). The fact that the above charac-\nteristicisabsent innon-codinggeneticsequences maybeinterpret ed inevolu-\ntionary terms. Genetic sequences directly involved in the protein-t ranslation\nprocesses were selected (among other things) as to bring the dist ance be-\ntween consecutive potential minima closer to 3, both in mean and fre quency\nof occurrence. This interpretation raises a question: how likely is it t o obtain\na randomly generated sequence with a structure similar to that of p rotein-\ncoding sequences? In other words, if we generate a random seque nce and\ncompute its probability function Pm(d), how likely is it to come up with a\nprobability function peaking at d\u2217= 3?.\nIn order to answer this question, we de\ufb01ne the parameters p3/2andp3/4\nas\n2The real physical charge values will depend on the system of units, which is contained\nbasically in the constant Kappearing in expression (2)\n18\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n(b)0.000.100.200.30\nP(d)0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n(a)0.000.100.200.30\nP(d)\nd\nd\nFigure 8: Plot of the 24 probability functions P4(d) corresponding to the 24\npermutations of the charge values given in table (13) using: (a) Drosophila \u2019s\nprotein-coding sequence and (b) Drosophila \u2019s non-coding sequence (inter-\ngenic).

It can be seen from the \ufb01gure that only a small fract ion of the\npoints (about 0.224)fall in region I, for which p3/2>1 andp3/4>1. The rest\nof the points fall in region II, in which p3/2<1 andp3/4>1. Therefore, the\nprobability of having a random sequence, 500 bases long, whose con secutive\npotential minima are more often separated by a distance d\u2217= 3, is close to\n0.224.\nOn the other hand, Figs.10b-f show similar graphs, but using protein -\ncoding sequences of real organisms. These graphs were constru cted by an-\nalyzing short coding sequences 500 bases in length. The fraction of points\nfalling in region I ( p3/2>1 andp3/4>1) for the di\ufb00erent organisms of Fig.10\nis summarized in the following table:\nOrganism Frac. region I\nrandom sequence 0.224000\nChlorella vulg. 0.788235\nDrosophila 0.780220\nDeinococcus rad. 0.803525\nMyc. tuberculosis 0.802643\nAeropyrum pernix 0.719973\nThese results show that protein-coding sequences are much more likely\nto have their consecutive potential minima separated by a distance d\u2217= 3.\nTo end thissection, we shouldmake a further comment. The fact th atthe\nmost probabledistance d\u2217between consecutive potential minima is d\u2217= 3for\n22\nprotein-coding sequences, is a consequence of the order in which t he bases or\ncodons appear along the sequence and are not related to the relat ive weight\n(fraction) of their occurrence. For example, Fig.11a shows the pr obability\nfunction P4(d) corresponding to a protein-coding sequence of Escherichia\ncoli, 45000 bases in length. In Fig.11b the codon composition, expresse d as\nfractional occurrence, of this sequence is depicted. To constru ct this last\ngraph, we labelled each codon in an arbitrary way, by assigning an inte ger\nnumber, from 0 for AAA up to 63 for GGG. On the horizontal axis the num-\nber of the codon is plotted, and on the vertical axis its fractional o ccurrence\nontheE. colisequence. Finally, Fig.11cshows theprobabilityfunction P4(d)\ncorresponding to a random sequence, of the same length and codo n compo-\nsition as the one used in Fig.11a. As can be seen, for the \u201crandomized \u201dE.\ncolisequence the most probable distance is no longer d\u2217= 3 as in Fig.11a,\nbutd\u2217= 2.\n5 Extended chain: M >1\nIn this section we consider the case in which the chain is composed of m ore\nthan one single monomer. As mentioned before, this re\ufb02ects the fa ct that\nthe ribosome is not a point particle after all. At each given time, the rib o-\nsome interacts with the mRNA at several points, giving rise to a collec tive\ninteraction. Electron microscopy has revealed that the mRNA thre ad passes\nacross the ribosome throughout a tunnelabout 10nm long and 2nm in di-\nameter [17]. Since nucleotide length is about 0.5nm, around 20 nucleot ides\nmay be in a position to interact simultaneously with the ribosome. Takin g\nthe above into account, we will work with a small chain, assuming M= 10\nas a reasonable length.\nIn the step-like limit, the interaction potential equation can be writt en\nby equation (3) now with the variables {Vj}given by:\nVj=KqjM/summationdisplay\ni=1pi (15)\nThemainmodi\ufb01cationcausedbyusingequation(15)insteadof(7)fo rthe\nrandom variables {Vj}is that they are no longer statistically independent.\nDue to the collective interaction between the chain and the polymer, these\nvariables are strongly correlated.

Note that for this random ized\nsequence, the peak at d= 3 is lost.\n24\nprobability function Pm(d) too di\ufb03cult for analytical treatment. Therefore,\nwe will present only numerical results.\nIn our simulations, Pm(d) presents an erratic behavior. The shape of this\nfunction strongly depends on the particular realization of monomer charges\nin the chain. For example, Fig.12a shows the probability function Pm(d) for\na polymer 500 monomers in length and a particular realization of charg es in\na 10-monomer chain. The charge values we used to generate these graphs\nwere{\u00b11,\u00b12}. Fig.12b shows a similar graph but for a di\ufb00erent realization\nof charges along the chain (the realization of charges in the polymer was the\nsameinbothcases). Ascanbeseen, these twographsdi\ufb00erconsid erably: the\n\ufb01rst presents a very sharp maximum at d\u2217= 2, whereas the second does so\natd\u2217= 3. Wide \ufb02uctuations in the probability function Pm(d) were always\npresent in our numerical simulations.\nThis \ufb02uctuating behavior did not occur in thesingle-monomer-chain c ase.\nIt is apparent from Fig.10a that the \ufb02uctuations of the probability f unction\nPm(d) in that case are rather small: the probability function has its highes t\nvalueatd\u2217= 2forthemajorityoftherealizations(77.6%)inthecase M= 1.\nAlso, the \ufb02uctuations are concentrated in a small region of the ( p3/2,p3/4)\nplane.\nIn order to have an idea of the magnitude of the \ufb02uctuations of the\nprobability function Pm(d) in the extended-chain case, we can make use of\nthe parameters p3/2andp3/4de\ufb01ned in expression (14). The \ufb02uctuations of\nthe probability function in the extenden-chain case are shown in Fig.1 3. To\nconstruct this \ufb01gure, a polymer 500 monomers in length was used alo ng with\na 10-monomer chain. The charge values in thepolymer aswell asinthe chain\nwere again {\u00b11,\u00b12}. The parameters p3/2andp3/4were calculated for 4500\ncharge realizations in the chain (the realization of charges in the poly mer was\nthe same in all the cases). Fig.13 is the plot of p3/2versusp3/4for these 4500\nrealizations. Two remarks are worth mentioning about this \ufb01gure:\n\u2022The points are spread out over a much wider region than in the single-\nmonomer-chain case (Fig.10a).\n\u2022The majority of the points fall in the region in which both p3/2>1 and\np3/4>1.\nThe following table shows the fractions of the points falling in each of t he\nfour regions of the graph:\n25\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n(b)00.20.40.60.8\nP(d)0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n(a)00.20.40.60.8\nP(d)\nd\nd\nFigure 12: Two graphs of the probability function P4(d) corresponding\nto two di\ufb00erent realizations of monomer charges for a 10-monomer chain\ninteracting with a 500 monomer polymer.

Note that\nthe points spread out over a much wider region than in Fig.10a.

In this view, the ribosome is tightly attached to the mRNA th read\nintheabsenceofGTP.Thisissobecausethechannelintheribosome through\nwhich the mRNA passes, is more or less closed. When a GTP molecule is\nsupplied (and transformed into GDP), this channel opens leaving th e mRNA\nthread free to move one codon. Subsequently the mRNA passage in the\nribosome closes again, trapping the mRNA molecule.\nIn this clamping mechanism several physicochemical factors are inv olved,\nwhich if taken into account in detail would lead to complex dynamical eq ua-\ntions hard to handle. In this work our approach is to look into the beh avior\nof oversimpli\ufb01ed molecular models which might capture some of the ess en-\ntial dynamical features of the system and may shed some light on ho w this\nmechanism could have arisen in the origin of life conditions.\nIn our modelling the dynamics of the system is governed by the appli-\ncation of an external force Fexto the chain in the horizontal direction, i.e.\nparallel to the polymer. By this means the chain will be forced to move\nalong the polymer. In principle, the force Fexmay be time dependent, but\nwe will restrict ourselves to a constant term. This force might come from a\nchemical pump (like GDP)or fromany other electromagnetic forcep resent in\nprebiotic conditions. The only purpose of this force in our model is to drive\nthe chain along the polymer (which is assumed to be \ufb01xed, N\u2192 \u221elimit),\navoiding it from getting trapped in some of the minima of the polymer-c hain\n28\ninteraction potential V(x). Therefore, we will also assume that Fexsatis\ufb01es\n|Fex|>max|\u2202V(x)/\u2202x|.\nOur analysis relies on Newton\u2019s equation of motion in a high friction\nregime, where inertial e\ufb00ects can be neglected. This regime actually exists in\nbiological molecular ratchets similar to the one we are considering [19, 20].\nUnder such conditions, the Newton\u2019s equation of motion acquires th e form\n\u03b3dx\ndt=\u2212\u2202V\u03b1\n\u03c3(x)\n\u2202x+Fex (16)\nwhere\u03b3is the friction coe\ufb03cient. In what follows, we will set \u03b3= 1, which is\nequivalent to setting the measure of the time unit. The above, thou gh a de-\nterministic equation, gives rise to a random dynamics due to the rand omness\nof the interaction potential V\u03b1\n\u03c3(x). In order to start analyzing this random\ndynamics, let us consider \ufb01rst the single-monomer-chain case M= 1. In this\ncase, as before, we will refer to the chain simply as \u201cthe particle\u201d.\n6.1 Single-monomer chain: M= 1. Random sequences.\nIn Fig.14a we show a typical realization of the velocity of the particle v(x) as\na function of its position xalong the polymer. This graph was constructed\nby solving numerically the equation of motion (16), using the fourth o rder\nRunge-Kuta method. The parameter values used were \u03b1= 2 and \u03c3= 0.5,\nand the monomer charge values were {\u00b11,\u00b12}(casem= 4). Fig.14b shows\nthe local-transit times of the particle along a short segment of the p olymer\n(40 monomers in length). This transit time is represented in arbitrar y units,\nand was computed by counting how many time steps the particle spen t in\nevery spatial interval \u2206 xthroughout the polymer. In the graph shown, the\nvalue of \u2206 xwas \u2206x= 0.25. It is apparent from this \ufb01gure that, in its way\nalong the polymer, the particle spends more time in certain regions th an in\nothers, the former being more or less regularly spaced along the po lymer.\nIn order to \ufb01nd out the spatial regularities in the dynamics of the sy stem,\nit is convenient to take the Fourier transform of the velocity v(x) of the\nparticle. Let us call \u02c6 v(k) the Fourier transform of v(x),kbeing the Fourier\nvariable conjugate to x.\nFig.15 shows the Fourier power spectrum of the velocity, |\u02c6v(k)|2, for two\ndi\ufb00erent realizations of monomer charges in the polymer. The param eter\nvalues in Fig.15a and Fig.15b are {\u03c3= 0.5, \u03b1= 1}and{\u03c3= 0.5, \u03b1= 4}\n29\n40 50 60 70 80\n(b)02040\nt(x)40 50 60 70 80\n(a)050100150\nv(x)\nx\nx\nFigure 14: (a) Typical realization of the velocity of the particle along the\npolymer as a function of the position x.

These dominant frequencies correspon d to spatial\nregularities \u03bb\u2217= 2\u03c0/k\u2217with values (a) \u03bb\u2217\u22433.29 and (b) \u03bb\u2217\u22433.30.\n31\nrespectively. These graphs were computed for the case m= 4, using the\ncharge values {\u00b11,\u00b12}. From the \ufb01gure, it is evident that there exists a\ndominant frequency k\u2217in the power spectrum of the velocity (the highest\npeak), whose corresponding spatial periodicity is \u03bb\u2217= 2\u03c0/k\u2217\u223c3.3. The\npower spectrum reveals a dynamical regularity in the motion of the p article\nthroughout the polymer. This regularity is inherited from the one pr esent\nin the random potential, in the sense that the particle spends more t ime in\nthe minima than in the maxima. The consequence is a slowing down of the\nvelocity nearly every three monomers, which is re\ufb02ected in the powe r spec-\ntrum. Our interpretation is that the peak occurring in the power sp ectrum\nof the velocity conveys the information on the average distance \u00afdbetween\nconsecutive potential minima, which for the case m= 4 is\u00afd\u223c3.4.\n6.2 Single-monomer chain: M= 1. Real sequences.\nAs in section 4, we can assign the charges along the polymer in corres pon-\ndence with the genetic sequence of real organisms. In order to do that, we\nwill use the same base-charge correspondence as in expression (1 3). The ob-\njective is to \ufb01nd out how the dynamics of the system changes when u sing\nreal genetic sequences instead of random ones. In what follows, t he value of\nthe parameters \u03b1and\u03c3will be\u03b1= 1,\u03c3= 0.5.\nThe power spectrum of the velocity of the particle throughout the poly-\nmer, when using protein-coding sequences of di\ufb00erent organisms, is shown\nin Fig.16. To generate these graphs, short coding sequences of se veral or-\nganisms, each 10000 monomers in length, were used. Two points are worth\nnoticing in this \ufb01gure. First, the peak in the power spectrum is much h igher\nthan in the random case. This indicates that there is a much more well de-\n\ufb01ned periodicity in the dynamics generated by interaction potentials when\nprotein-coding sequences are used. Second, the spatial periodic ity re\ufb02ected\nin the peak of the power spectrum is much closer to 3 than in the rand om\ncase.\nThis dynamical behavior is not present when real but non-coding se -\nquences are used. For example, in Fig.17 we show the power spectru m of\nthe velocity of the particle along the polymer, for two cases in which t he\nmonomer charges in the polymer were assigned in correspondence w ith inter-\ngenic regions of two organisms. As can be seen, the structure of s uch spectra\nis similar to the one obtained in the random case.

In this case the\nspatial periodicity is weaker (or absent) than in Fig.16. It seems tha t the\nnon-coding sequences of real organisms have a random like struct ure.\n34\nregions again seem to have a random structure.\nThe fact that the power spectrum corresponding to protein-cod ing se-\nquences exhibits a very sharp periodicity at \u03bb\u2217\u22433, whereas the one corre-\nsponding to non-coding sequences does not, has already been rep orted in the\nliterature [21]. Nonetheless, in these previous works the power spe ctrum of\nthe \u201cbare\u201d genetic sequences is analyzed, namely, without conside ring any\nkind of interaction potential or dynamical behavior. What we have s hown\nhere, though, is that this \u201cstructural\u201d periodicity around three t ransforms\ninto adynamical periodicity in the motion of the particle along the polymer.\n6.3 Extended chain: M=10\nThe most interesting dynamics occurs when an extended chain is inte racting\nwith the polymer. In such a situation, a collective interaction prevails . At\nevery moment there are several contact points between the cha in and the\npolymer. As we have already pointed out, collective interaction betw een the\nchain and the polymer gives rise to a widely \ufb02uctuating probability func tion\nPm(d). The sameoccurs with thepower spectrum ofthe velocity ofthe c hain\nalong the polymer. However, these \ufb02uctuations, far from being an noying,\nproduce a much richer dynamical behavior than in the single-monome r-chain\ncase.\nIn Fig.18 we show the power spectra of the velocity of the chain along\nthe polymer for two di\ufb00erent random realizations of monomer charg es in\nthe chain. The charges in the polymer were the same in both cases. T hese\ngraphs were constructed with a polymer 500 monomers in length and a 10-\nmonomer chain. The parameter values used were \u03c3= 0.5 and\u03b1= 1. Also,\nthe charge values were, as above {\u00b11,\u00b12}. From the \ufb01gure, it is apparent\nthat thepower spectrum ofthe velocity exhibits a very well de\ufb01ned dominant\nfrequency, even though the charges in both the polymer and the chain were\nassigned at random . The power spectrum in Fig.18a presents a dominant\nfrequency corresponding to a spatial periodicity \u03bb\u2217\u22432, whereas the corre-\nsponding periodicity in the power spectrum shown in Fig.18b is \u03bb\u2217\u22433. We\nshould explain this di\ufb00erence.\nThe power spectrum appearing in Fig.18a was constructed by using a\npolymer and a chain whose associated probability function P4(d) has the\nsame shape as the one of Fig.12a. Namely, for this system the proba bility\nfunction has a very high value at d\u2217= 2.

These two graphs correspond to two\ndi\ufb00erent random realizations of monomer charges in the chain. (a) T he\nspatial periodicity is \u03bb\u2217\u22432.01 and (b) \u03bb\u2217\u22432.88. In (a) the corresponding\nprobability function had a shape like the one in Fig.12a with d\u2217= 2 and\nbard\u22432, whereas in (b) the probability function was as in Fig.12b with\nd\u2217= 3 and \u00afd\u22433. In the extended-chain case, there is a \ufb01nite correlation\nlengt along the potential (equal to the size of the chain), which is re \ufb02ected\nin the little \u201cheaps\u201d appearing in the power spectrum.\n36\nspectrum in Fig.18b corresponds to a system whose probability func tion has\navery sharppeakat d\u2217= 3, astheoneshowninFig.12b. Fromournumerical\nsimulations, we can conclude that whenever the probability function has a\nsharp maximum at a distance d\u2217, the power spectrum of the velocity also\npresents a sharp peak corresponding to a spatial periodicit y\u03bb\u2217=d\u2217.\nAs we have seen, in the collective-interaction case the most probab le con-\n\ufb01gurations are those in which the probability function P4(d) has its highest\nvalue atd\u2217= 3 (see Fig.13). Therefore, if we assign at random the monomer\ncharges in the polymer and in the chain, with high probability we will come\nup with a dynamics possessing a very well de\ufb01ned periodicity: the cha in will\nmove along the polymer in \u201cjumps\u201d whose length is nearly three monom ers.\n7 Summary and discussion\nThe results presented throughout this work suggest a possible sc enario for\nthe origin of the three base codon structure of the genetic code. In this sce-\nnario, primitive one dimensional molecular machines, initially with a rando m\nstructure, exhibited a regular dynamics with a \u201cpreference\u201d for a movement\nin steps of three bases. By \u201csteps\u201d we mean a slowing down of the ve locity\nof the chain along the polymer, nearly every three monomers (see F ig.14b).\nEven in the simplest case in which the chain consists of only one monome r,\nthe above dynamical regularity is apparent. We can think of the dyn amics\nof primitive molecular machines as being \u201cbiased towards three\u201d.\nThe preceding property is quite robust inasmuch as it hardly depend s on\nthe particular kind of interaction between the polymer and the chain . On\none hand, the kind of electrostatic potentials we have used is repre sentative\nof the actual interaction potentials between particles occurring in Nature.\nThese potentials are characterized in our model by the parameter \u03b1. We\nhave also seen that the distribution distances between neighboring maxima\nand minima along the interaction potential, characterized by the pro bability\nfunction Pm(d), does not depend on this parameter (for small values of \u03c3),\ni.e. it will be the same whether the interaction is coulombian or dipolar or\nof any other (electrostatic) type.\nOn the other hand, the spatial distribution of interaction potentia l min-\nima also does not depend on the particular values of the monomer cha rges\n{qj}and{pi}, as long as these values are of the same order of magnitude. An\n37\nimportant feature that the charges must comply with is that they t ake more\nthan two di\ufb00erent values. This allows for an order relation to be esta blished\namong the di\ufb00erent types of monomers, leading to a maxima and minima\nstructure of the interaction potential. The probability function Pm(d), which\ngivestheprobabilityoftwo consecutive minima beingseparatedbyad istance\nd, only depends on m, namely, onthe number of di\ufb00erent types of monomers.\nAsmincreases, the mean distance \u00afdbetween consecutive potential minima\napproaches three. Nevertheless, in the particle (single-monomer -chain) case,\nthe most probable distance is d\u2217= 2 (form >2).\nStillinthisparticlecase, considerablechangestakeplacewhenthec harges\nalongthepolymer areassignedincorrespondence withprotein-cod inggenetic\nsequences of real organisms. In this case, not only is the mean dist ance\u00afd\nbetween neighboring potential minima nearly three, but also the mos t prob-\nable one, d\u2217, happens to be three. This is a remarkable property of protein-\ncoding sequences, perhaps acquired throughout evolution. Furh termore the\nfact that this \u201cre\ufb01nement\u201d is absent in non-coding sequences of r eal organ-\nisms, strongly suggests that it is a consequence of the dynamical p rocesses\ninvolved in the protein synthesis mechanisms.\nThis interpretation is supported by the results obtained when the dynam-\nicsof the particle moving along the polymer is considered. In the random\nsequence case, there are dominant frequencies in the power spec trum of the\nparticle velocity related with the spatial regularities of the interact ion po-\ntential. Moreover in the protein-coding sequence case, the power spectrum\nof the velocity shows a very well de\ufb01ned periodicity corresponding a lmost\nexactly to a spatial distance \u03bb\u2217= 3. Again, this behavior does not occur\nfor non-coding sequences of real organisms, which are not involve d in the\ntranslation processes.\nA richer dynamics emerges when the chain is composed of several mo -\nnomers. In this, more realistic, collective-interaction case, the pr obability\nfunction Pm(d) presents very wide \ufb02uctuations, depending on the particular\nassignmentofmonomerchargesinthechain. Nevertheless, themo stprobable\ncon\ufb01gurations are those for which the probability function has its h ighest\nvalue at d\u2217= 3. For these con\ufb01gurations, the power spectrum of the chain\nvelocity along the polymer exhibits a very well de\ufb01ned spatial periodic ity at\n\u03bb\u2217\u22433.\nOur results suggest an origin of life scenario in which primordial molec-\nular machines of chains moving along polymers in quasi one-dimensiona l\n38\ngeometries, that eventually led to the protein synthesis processe s, were bi-\nased towards a dynamics favoring the motion in \u201csteps\u201d or \u201cjumps\u201d of three\nmonomers. The higher likelyhood of these primitive\u201cribosomes\u201d may h ave\nled to the present ribosomal dynamics where mRNA moves along rRNA in a\nchannel conformed by the ribosome. Dynamics may have acted in th is sense\nas one of the evolutionary \ufb01lter favoring the three base codon com position\nof the genetic code.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank Leo Kadano\ufb00, Sue Coppersmith, Haim Diamant an d\nCristian Huepe for very useful discussions and corrections.

By a complete enu-\nmeration of the total number of sequences obtained by introd ucing up to 4\npoint mutations and up to 7 composition\u2013conserving mutatio ns (swapping\nof amino acids) in a 36mers chain, it is found that there are 108\u2212109se-\nquences which in the folding process target onto the \u201cnative \u201d conformation.\nConsequently, proteins with designed sequences display a r emarkable degree\nof stability and, to a large extent, of designability.\n1\nA number of previous analyses [1\u20136] (reviewed in [7,8]) have provided a rguments and\nsupporting evidence for the deep connection existing between the energetic properties of\nprotein sequences and their ability to fold fast into their native conf ormations. In particular\nit was found [2\u20134] that the presence of a large (compared to the dis persion of interaction\nenergies) energy gap between the native state and the bulk of misf olded conformations that\nare structurally dissimilar to the native state is an important factor that ensures fast folding\ninto the native conformation (foldability requirement). A number of observations support\nthe notion that sequences of natural proteins have been optimize d to satisfy the foldability\nrequirement:\n1) Random sequences undergo non-cooperative folding transition [9,10] while designed\nsequences and proteins fold cooperatively [1,3,4,11,12].\n2) The native state of random sequences is very unstable even to s mall changes in poten-\ntial function [13] while the ones that have larger gaps are much more robust with respect to\nchanges in the energy function [14,15]. The latter behavior is charac teristic of real proteins\nthat exhibit the remarkable ability to maintain their native structure intact in a wide range\nof conditions including variation of temperature, pH, solvent compo sition etc.\n3) It was shown theoretically that ground (native) states of rand om sequences are very\nunstable with respect to point mutations: the probability that a mut ated sequence has the\nsame native state scales as \u03b3\u22128where\u03b3is the number of conformations per one residue in\nthe chain [16]. In contrast, real proteins are able to accomodate n umerous mutations that\nare neutral with respect to structure changes [17] . This fact ha s obvious implication for the\nmolecular evolution ofproteins: it accounts forthe existence of lar gefamilies of proteins that\nmay have diverged from a common root. Proteins belonging to a family have homologous\nsequences and their native states are structurally similar.\nWhile the stability of designed sequences with respect to point mutat ions has been\ndemonstrated [18] in simulations, and the fact that larger energy g aps imply greater ability\nof the designed sequence to accomodate many neutral mutations acknowledged [1\u20134,19\u201321],\nthe actual quantitative analysis of how many mutations exist that p reserve the native state\n2\nwas missing.\nIn what follows we present a quantitative analysis of how many neutr al mutations can\nproteinlike sequences of various degree of gap optimization accomo date. The outcome of\nthis analysis is ba\ufb04ing. In fact, it will be concluded that designed prot eins can accomodate\nbillions of multiple mutations without changing their ability to fold on shor t call into the\nnative conformation.\nFor the analysis we use lattice model of a protein that has been used earlier by us\n[18,23,24] and others [25,26]. The model sequences are composed of aminoacids of 20 types\nand contain 36 monomers. Two aminoacids are considered interactin g if they occupy neigh-\nboring positions on the lattice but are not sequence neighbors. The energy of the interaction\ndepends on the identity of the aminoacids involved, so that there is a 20\u00d720 parameter\nmatrix that describes the energetics in the model. We used the set o f parameters suggested\nby Miyazawa and Jernigan ( table 6 of Ref. [27]). The associated stan dard deviation of the\ninteraction energies between di\ufb00erent aminoacid types is \u03c3= 0.3.\nOur approach to protein simulations is based on the idea of designing s equences having a\nlarge energy gap in the target conformation chosen to serve as a n ative state for simulations\n[4,28].\nA sequence that has su\ufb03ciently low energy in a conformation chosen as native is denoted\nas S36(cf. caption to Fig. 1). This sequence is the same as was studied in pr evious\npublications [18,23,24]. In the units we are considering ( RTroom= 0.6 kcal/mol), the energy\nof S36in its native conformation (cf. Fig. 1(a) ) is Enat=\u221216.5. Starting from a random\ncon\ufb01guration, the sequence S 36always reaches the native con\ufb01guration, and it does it in\na rather short time, of the order of 106MC steps. This is a consequence of the fact that\nthe value of the energy gap \u03b4(=2.5), that is, the energy di\ufb00erence between the native and\nthe lowest dissimilar con\ufb01guration (con\ufb01guration with a similarity para meterq[29] much\nsmaller than one) is large, much larger than the variance of the cont act energies. The goal of\nour present analysis is to characterize quantitatively how many mut ations can S36tolerate\nwithout losing the ability to fold into its native state. In other words, our study aims at\n3\nproviding an estimate of the number of sequences, having a certain degree of homology to\nS36, that fold into its native structure.\nTo characterize quantitatively single or multiple mutations, we ascrib e to them a value\n\u2206E[18], de\ufb01ned as the di\ufb00erence between the energies of the altered s equence (S\u2019 36) and\nof the intact chain (S 36), both calculated in the native con\ufb01guration (Fig. 1(a) ). The\nquantity \u2206 Eis a measure of how the energy gap changes upon a mutation provide d that\nthe distribution of energies of conformations that are dissimilar to t he native state remains\nuna\ufb00ected by the mutation [18]. This was shown to be the case when m utations do not\nchange the aminoacid compositions [3,4,18]. In this study we have analy sed both the kinds\nof mutations which conserve and which do not conserve the compos ition of the protein.\nThis gives a lower and an upper limit for the number of mutations which t he \u201cwild\u2013type\u201d\nsequence can tollerate.\nAcompleteenumerationofallsequences S\u2032\n36hasbeendoneuptosevenmutationskeeping\n\ufb01xed the amino acid composition of the chain (swapping), and up to fo ur without this\nconstraint (pointlike). Simulating the dynamics [4] of \ufb01fty sequence s chosen among the\nmutated sequences, with the same composition of S 36and with \u2206 E < \u03b4, it turned out that\nin 100% of the cases, they can reach the native conformation in a tim e comparable to the\nfolding time of S 36. Repeating the same analysis on \ufb01fty sequences with up to four poin tlike\nmutations, we observed that only in three cases the chain \ufb01nds con formations dissimilar\nfrom the native one, with lower energy, and it is not able to \ufb01nd the na tive conformation\nwithin the simulation time.\nFurtherwestudiedtheimpactofpointlikemutationsonsequences h avingdi\ufb00erentdegree\nof design. To this end we calculated the distributions n2(\u2206E) associated with two pointlike\nmutationsforthecaseofthreesequences designedtofoldintoth estructureshowninFig.1(a)\nwithdi\ufb00erent energygaps. Thedistributionsforallthreesequenc es appeartobevery similar\nto each other (Fig.2). This is also true for composition\u2013conserving m utations and for the\ndi\ufb00erent numbers of mutations we have analyzed (data not shown) . These results suggest\nthat the distribution nm(\u2206E) associated with mmutations has some degree of universality.\n4\nGiven a sequence characterized by an energy gap \u03b4, it is then possible to calculate the\nnumber of sequences which fold to the same native structure (i.e. f or which there is still\nsome energy gap between the native structure and the bulk of dec oys) and which di\ufb00er from\nthe \u201dwild\u2013type\u201d sequence by mmutations. To do this one has to calculate the quantity\nNm(\u03b4) =/integraldisplay\u03b4\n\u2212\u221edE nm(E). (1)\nAs an example we provide the function Nm(\u03b4) form= 4 and for the case of pointlike\nmutations (Fig.3). The corresponding values of Nmfor the sequence S 36(whose gap is\n\u03b4= 2.5) for up to 4 pointlike and 7 swap mutations are shown in Table 1. The c alculation of\nthe total number of sequences N(\u03b4) =/summationtext\nmNm(\u03b4) is beyond our calculational power, and can\nbe established only with approximate methods [30]. The results obtain ed with the \u201csmall\u201d\nnumber of mutations shown in Table 1, and which provide a lower limit to t he total number\nof sequences folding to the same native structure is in any case impr essive, namely 108\u2212109.\nThe same study has been repeated using other two fully compact ta rget structures (Figs.\n1(b) and 1(c) ), generated by the collapse of a 36 monomers homop olymeric chain at low\ntemperature (below the \u03b8\u2013point, see e.g. [31]). The results are virtually identical to the ones\nshown in Fig. 2.\nThe present study further suggests that the normalized gap \u03be=\u03b4/\u03c3(or the closely\nrelated to it z-score [1,29,32]) is a major determinant of the ability of s equences to fold. To\nthis end, the \u201dresilience\u201d of sequences against point mutations is dir ectly related to their\nenergetic impact: if the cumulative e\ufb00ect of mutations on the energ y of the native state\nis weak enough so that the energy gap for the native state remains , the mutations are\nneutral and the mutated sequences will still fold into the native sta te, albeit at a decreased\nstability. Therefore, the whole issue of the estimating the number o f mutations that are\ntolerated by a sequence (and hence the number of homologous seq uences that fold to the\nsameconformation)isreduced toenumerating mutationsthatkee ptheenergygapasde\ufb01ned\nbefore.\nAnotheraspect ofsequence designknownas\u201ddesignability\u201d wasdis cussed byanumber of\n5\nauthors [19,33,34]. The concept of \u201ddesignability\u201d focuses on the en tropy in sequence space\nstating that structures that can accomodate more sequences t hat have them as the non\u2013\ndegenerate ground state are more \u201ddesignable\u201d, and represent the structures of naturally\nexisting proteins. Our study is not entirely unrelated to the issue of designability since it\nshowsthatthegreaterthegapis, themoresequenceshomologou stothe\u201cwildtype\u201dsequence\nexist that target on the \u201cnative\u201d conformation in the folding proce ss and, as a consequence,\nhas this conformation as its non\u2013degenerate ground state. Howe ver, it addresses in fact\na di\ufb00erent question, namely: how many sequences homologous to th e \u201dwild-type\u201d exist\nthat fold into the same conformation, being this number a lower limit fo r the degree of\ndesignability of a structure. In order to fully address this question within our approach one\nhas to consider two further issues: a) that there exist many non- homologous sequences that\ncan still fold to the same conformation [20,35,36], and b) that the des ignability principle\nemphasizes the strong dependence of the number of sequences o n the properties of the target\nstructure. In any case, we have provided circumstantial evidenc e concerning the fact that\ndesignability of a given structure may be closely related to the maxima l gap with which\nsequences can be \ufb01t into it. (A similar point was also made earlier by sev eral authors\n[19\u201321,33]). In this case the issue of designability reduces to the que stion of what structures\nallow sequences with greater gaps. We are planning to address this is sue in the near future.\nSumming up, in thispaper we provided a quantitative estimate ofthe n umber ofmutated\nsequences that are still able to fold to the same conformation and f ound it to be \u201dastro-\nnomically\u201d large. The actual number of these sequences, and thus the designability of the\ncorresponding conformation, is controlled by the dimensionless par ameter\u03be=\u03b4/\u03c3, which\nin turn also controls the folding ability of the notional protein.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis work was partially supported by NIH grant RO1 GM52126 (to ES) .
