Some authors have suggested that selection o f some of the rarer tRNA species may be the rate-limiting step in protein synthesis (Varenne et al., 1984): they hy- pothesize that the rate of polypeptide elongation could act as a reg ulatory mechanism in gene expression when clusters of rare codons undergo translatio n, i.e. We rewrite the formula (1) for the time jrequired to duplicate a bacterium belonging to group jas j=/parenleftbiggj a1+l Inserting the Ansatz mj=M0exp( t j) (M0is the total mass at time t= 0) in the equation (4), and using the relations (2), we get for the asymptotic state (1 ) j +l j l j+1x+j l j 11 x= 0, (7) wherex= exp( r).

While the stability of designed sequences with respect to point mutat ions has been demonstrated [18] in simulations, and the fact that larger energy g aps imply greater ability of the designed sequence to accomodate many neutral mutations acknowledged [1\u20134,19\u201321], the actual quantitative analysis of how many mutations exist that p reserve the native state 2 was missing. This is a consequence of the fact that the value of the energy gap (=2.5), that is, the energy difference between the native and the lowest dissimilar configuration (configuration with a similarity para meterq[29] much smaller than one) is large, much larger than the variance of the cont act energies. In order to fully address this question within our approach one has to consider two further issues: a) that there exist many non- homologous sequences that can still fold to the same conformation [20,35,36], and b) that the des ignability principle emphasizes the strong dependence of the number of sequences o n the properties of the target structure.
