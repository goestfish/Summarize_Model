INTRODUCTION\nMany physical ideas are \ufb01nding applications in complex biological syste ms these days\n[1,2]. Recently, we presented a theoretical scheme in which one can in vestigate the ratios\nbetween the fractional population of blood groups [3]. This method h as some analogy with\nthe physical concept of renormalization and\ufb01xed points. Inthis pa per, we extend the theory\nto investigate the problem of sex-linked inheritance.\nIn sex-linked inheritance, there are \ufb01ve population groups, XX,X\u2032X,X\u2032X\u2032,XY, and\nX\u2032Y, whereX,X\u2032andYrepresent the normal female, the defective female, and the male\nchromosome, respectively. The group of so called carrier female is c haracterized by X\u2032X.\nThegeneticruleisthatsonsreceive Yanddaughtersdo XorX\u2032fromtheirfathers. Similarly,\ntheir mothers deliver XorX\u2032to sons and daughters. It is also known that there exist\nmutations between XandX\u2032. Another important factor in the present problem is that the\ndefective groups, X\u2032X\u2032andX\u2032Y, have disadvantages in surviving and inheriting unlike in\nthe case of the blood groups [3]. This selection process should be tak en into account for any\nreasonable discussions. Therefore, we consider the inheritance o f sex-linked disease in the\npresence of mutation and selection and obtain the governing equat ions, which determine the\nnext fractional populations from the previous ones. The governin g equations will be used\nto investigate the problems of genetic propagations of chromosom e-linked diseases such as\ncolor blindness and hemophilia.\nII. FRACTIONAL POPULATION EQUATIONS\nWe consider the \ufb01ve fractional populations with the following constr aints:\nXX(n)+X\u2032X(n)+X\u2032X\u2032(n) = 1 (1)\nXY(n)+X\u2032Y(n) = 1,\nfor then-th generation. The ratios of gene frequencies without mutation c an be determined\nas\n/tildewidestXf(n) =XX(n)+1\n2X\u2032X(n),\n/tildewidestX\u2032\nf(n) =X\u2032X\u2032(n)+1\n2X\u2032X(n), (2)\n/tildewidestXm(n) =XY(n),\n/tildewidestX\u2032m(n) =X\u2032Y(n).\nAlthough the mutation between the normal chromosome Xand the defective one X\u2032\nwould be rare, still it plays an important role in the following discussion. In order to\nconsider the mutation, we introduce two probability factors, \u03b1and\u03b2for the following\nmutation processes;\nX\u03b1\u2212\u2192X\u2032andX\u03b2\u2190\u2212X\u2032. (3)\nThrough the above mutation processes, the gene frequencies ar e modi\ufb01ed as\n2\nXf(n) = (1\u2212\u03b1)/tildewiderXf(n)+\u03b2/tildewiderX\u2032\nf(n),\nX\u2032\nf(n) = (1\u2212\u03b2)/tildewiderX\u2032\nf(n)+\u03b1/tildewiderXf(n), (4)\nXm(n) = (1\u2212\u03b1)/tildewiderXm(n)+\u03b2/tildewiderX\u2032\nm(n),\nX\u2032\nm(n) = (1\u2212\u03b2)/tildewiderX\u2032\nm(n)+\u03b1/tildewiderXm(n).\nThefractionalpopulationequations, whichgovernthepopulations ofthenextgeneration,\nare now written as\n/tildewidestXX(n+1) =Xf(n)\u00d7Xm(n),\n/tildewidestX\u2032X(n+1) =X\u2032\nf(n)\u00d7Xm(n)+Xf(n)\u00d7X\u2032\nm(n),\n/tildewidestX\u2032X\u2032(n+1) =X\u2032\nf(n)\u00d7X\u2032\nm(n), (5)\n/tildewidestXY(n+1) =Xf(n),\n/tildewidestX\u2032Y(n+1) =X\u2032\nf(n).\nSince the defective chromosome causes a disease, the populations of/tildewidestX\u2032X\u2032and/tildewidestX\u2032Ywill\nhave less chances of surviving and inheriting their genes. In order t o re\ufb02ect this disad-\nvantages, we introduce disadvantage factors \u03b4ffor the female and \u03b4mfor the male groups,\nrespectively. Then, the populations of/tildewidestX\u2032X\u2032and/tildewidestX\u2032Ywill be modi\ufb01ed as\nPop[/tildewidestX\u2032X\u2032(n+1)]\u2212\u2192(1\u2212\u03b4f)Pop[/tildewidestX\u2032X\u2032(n+1)], (6)\nPop[/tildewidestX\u2032Y(n+1)]\u2212\u2192(1\u2212\u03b4m)Pop[/tildewidestX\u2032Y(n+1)].\nWith normalization, the fractional population equations are given by\nXX(n+1) =Xf(n)\u00b7Xm(n)\n1\u2212\u03b4fX\u2032\nf(n)\u00b7X\u2032\nm(n),\nX\u2032X(n+1) =X\u2032\nf(n)\u00b7Xm(n)+Xf(n)\u00b7X\u2032\nm(n)\n1\u2212\u03b4fX\u2032\nf(n)\u00b7X\u2032m(n),\nX\u2032X\u2032(n+1) =(1\u2212\u03b4f)X\u2032\nf(n)\u00b7X\u2032\nm(n)\n1\u2212\u03b4fX\u2032\nf(n)\u00b7X\u2032m(n), (7)\nXY(n+1) =Xf(n)\n1\u2212\u03b4mX\u2032\nf(n),\nX\u2032Y(n+1) =(1\u2212\u03b4m)X\u2032\nf(n)\n1\u2212\u03b4mX\u2032\nf(n).\nThe above governing equations (1) \u223c(7) yield the following constraint relations for any gen-\nerationn,\nXf(n)+X\u2032\nf(n) = 1 and Xm(n)+X\u2032\nm(n) = 1. (8)\nIn order to understand the change of populations along generatio ns, it is convenient to\nconsider the automata equations for X\u2032\nfandX\u2032\nmonly, which are given by\n3\nX\u2032\nm(n+1) =\u03b1+(1\u2212\u03b1\u2212\u03b2\u2212\u03b4m(1\u2212\u03b2))X\u2032\nf(n)\n1\u2212\u03b4mX\u2032\nf(n), (9)\n2X\u2032\nf(n+1) =2\u03b1+(1\u2212\u03b1\u2212\u03b2)/parenleftBig\nX\u2032\nf(n)+X\u2032\nm(n)/parenrightBig\n\u22122\u03b4f(1\u2212\u03b2)X\u2032\nf(n)\u00b7X\u2032\nm(n)\n1\u2212\u03b4fX\u2032\nf(n)\u00b7X\u2032m(n).\nThe above coupled recursion relations can now be used to study the \ufb01xed points of X\u2032\nm\nandX\u2032\nf, which correspond to the equilibrium values where X\u2032\nm(n+ 1) =X\u2032\nm(n) =X\u2032\nm\u2217\nandX\u2032\nf(n+ 1) =X\u2032\nf(n) =X\u2032\nf\u2217. The \ufb01xed points of X\u2032\nf\u2217are given by the solutions of the\nalgebraic equation,\na0+a1X\u2032\nf\u2217+a2(X\u2032\nf\u2217)2+a3(X\u2032\nf\u2217)3= 0, (10)\nwhere the coe\ufb03cients aiare given by\na0=\u03b1(3\u2212\u03b1\u2212\u03b2),\na1= (\u03b1+\u03b2)(\u03b1+\u03b2\u22123)+\u03b4m(2\u03b2\u2212\u03b1\u2212\u03b22\u2212\u03b1\u03b2\u22121)+2\u03b4f\u03b1(\u03b2\u22121), (11)\na2=\u03b4m(1+\u03b1+\u03b2)+2\u03b4f(2\u03b1+2\u03b2\u2212\u03b22\u2212\u03b1\u03b2\u22121)+2\u03b4m\u03b4f(\u03b2\u22121)2,\na3= 2\u03b4f(1\u2212\u03b1\u2212\u03b2)+2\u03b4m\u03b4f(\u03b2\u22121).\nSolving this equation for stable \ufb01xed points, we can readily determine the equilibrium pop-\nulation ratios.\nWe study the \ufb01xed points in several cases. First of all, in the case of no mutation;\n\u03b1= 0 and \u03b2= 0, the meaningful \ufb01xed point, X\u2032\nf\u2217, is given by 0. It correctly predicts\nthat without mutations, the defective genes will disappear eventu ally. Secondly, when only\nmutations are considered in the theory assuming \u03b4m= 0 and\u03b4f= 0, the \ufb01xed point is given\nbyX\u2032\nf\u2217=\u03b1/(\u03b1+\u03b2). This result will be used in the discussion for color blindness. In othe r\ngeneral cases, the exact solution cannot be expressed in a closed form. However, since the\nmutation rates are known to be very small( \u223c10\u22125\u223c10\u22127), the \ufb01xed point X\u2032\nf\u2217can be\nexpressed in terms of \u03b1and\u03b2in an approximate fashion and will be discussed in the next\nsection.\nIII. COLOR BLINDNESS AND HEMOPHILIA\nThe disadvantage, that a color blindness man or woman has, is not se vere enough to\nreduce the chance of survival signi\ufb01cantly. Hence, we let the disad vantage factors be simply\nzero in this case. Then, we easily notice from Eq. (9) that the \ufb01xed p oint is given by\nX\u2032\nm\u2217=X\u2032\nf\u2217=\u03b1\n\u03b1+\u03b2. (12)\nThis result is identical to that obtained in the conventional genetics [4].\nUsing the fractional population equations of Eq. (7) and the above \ufb01xed point, we obtain\nthe population ratios as\nXY:X\u2032Y=X\u2217\nf:X\u2032\nf\u2217= 1\u2212X\u2032\nf\u2217:X\u2032\nf\u2217=\u03b2:\u03b1, (13)\n4\nand furthermore\nXX:X\u2032X:X\u2032X\u2032=\u03b22: 2\u03b2\u03b1:\u03b12. (14)\nThe above result is the well known the Hardy-Weinberg law [5].\nThe demographic data for color blindness in England show that XY:X\u2032Y= 12 : 1 [6].\nHence we conclude that \u03b2:\u03b1= 12 : 1. We notice that X\u2032chromosome is more unstable\nthanXchromosome since \u03b2is much larger than \u03b1. The abundance of carrier female is easily\nnoticed by the fact that XX:X\u2032X:X\u2032X\u2032= 144 : 24 : 1.\nHemophilia is a dreadful disease which a\ufb00ects the chance of survival and mating signi\ufb01-\ncantly. All of the female group X\u2032X\u2032perish completely upon birth. Hence, the disadvantage\nfactor\u03b4fis equal to 1. Then the \ufb01xed point X\u2032\nf\u2217can be expressed up to the second order of\n\u03b1and\u03b2as follows using Eq. (10) and (11),\nX\u2032\nf\u2217=3\n\u03b4m\u03b1+/parenleftBigg\n\u22124\n\u03b4m+12\n\u03b42\nm\u221218\n\u03b43\nm/parenrightBigg\n\u03b12+/parenleftBigg5\n\u03b4m\u22129\n\u03b42\nm/parenrightBigg\n\u03b1\u03b2+O(\u03b13,\u03b12\u03b2,\u03b1\u03b22,\u03b23), (15)\nX\u2032\nm\u2217= (\u22122+3\n\u03b4m)\u03b1+/parenleftBigg\n\u22122\u221210\n\u03b4m+30\n\u03b42\nm\u221218\n\u03b43\nm/parenrightBigg\n\u03b12+/parenleftBigg\n\u22122+11\n\u03b4m\u22129\n\u03b42\nm/parenrightBigg\n\u03b1\u03b2+O(\u03b13,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7).(16)\nA numerical calculation of the stable \ufb01xed point, X\u2032\nf\u2217using Eq. (10) is shown in Fig. 1. We\n\ufb01nd thatthe dominant contributions comefrom \u03b1and\u03b4masEq. (15)indicates. We also \ufb01nd\nthat the values of the \ufb01xed point X\u2032\nf\u2217are independent of initial values. The approximate\nexpressions, Eqs. (15) and (16) are found in good agreement with the exact expression Eq.\n(10) except when \u03b4mis near zero.\nIt is useful to consider the male hemophilia population before selectio n in order to relate\nthe above formulation with the statistical data. Here, the relevan t demographic data is the\nratio,r, between the mutation cases and the all hemophilia cases;/tildewidestX\u2032Y\u2217\nmut=r\u00b7/tildewidestX\u2032Y\u2217. Using\nEqs. (2)\u223c(7), the population of male infants with hemophilia before selection ca n be written\nas\n/tildewidestX\u2032Y\u2217=1\n2(1+\u03b1\u2212\u03b2)X\u2032X\u2217+\u03b1XX\u2217\u2261/tildewidestX\u2032Y\u2217\ninh+/tildewidestX\u2032Y\u2217\nmut. (17)\nHere, the second term represents the male population having hemo philia caused by the\nspontaneous gene mutation. Actually, the \ufb01rst term also contains the gene mutation contri-\nbution of1\n2(\u03b1\u2212\u03b2)X\u2032X\u2217. However, when the demographic data rare collected, there is no\nway to distinguish the inheritance from the mutation in this case, bec ause data collectors\nsimply check whether there were hemophiliac occurrences in the fam ily line or not. It is\nstraightforward to show that ris related to the disadvantage factor \u03b4mand the mutation\nrates\u03b1and\u03b2. From Eqs. (2)\u223c(7), we \ufb01nd\n\u03b4m= 3r+(10\u221210r\u22122\nr)\u03b1+(\u22123+5r)\u03b2+O(\u03b12,\u03b1\u03b2). (18)\nThe early statistical data for the infant male population having hemo philia [7] show that\n/tildewidestXY:/tildewidestX\u2032Y\u2243104: 1. Assuming that the current fractional population distribution h as\nreached a \ufb01xed point, we \ufb01nd X\u2032\nf\u2217\u224310\u22124from Eq. (5). Furthermore, a recent statistics\nshows that the rate ris given by r\u22431\n3[8]. This data and Eq. (18) yield \u03b4m= 1\u2212O(\u03b1,\u03b2).\n5\nThis result is in a reasonable agreement with the fact that various th erapies treating male\nhemophilia have beeninvented onlyrecently and, thus, theprobabilit yofsuccessful marriage\nandreproductionwasalmostzeroformalepatient inthepast. With \u03b4m\u22431andX\u2032\nf\u2217\u224310\u22124,\nwe \ufb01nd from Eq. (15) that the value of \u03b1is about 3 .3\u00d710\u22125, which is in a reasonable range\nas the probability of mutation. Also, we can obtain the population rat io of the carrier female\ngroup using Eq. (7); XX:X\u2032X:X\u2032X\u2032\u223c104: 1.33 : 0.\nSince thelevel of therapies treating malehemophilia hasnow reached thestage that most\nof male patient can marry and reproduce, it is interesting to study t he case\u03b4m= 0 and make\npredictionshowthemutationrateandthefractionalpopulationwill changeaccordingly. The\n\ufb01xed point of Eq. (15) and (16) will be modi\ufb01ed as\nX\u2032\nf\u2217=/radicalBigg\n3\n2\u03b11\n2+O(\u03b1,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7), (19)\nX\u2032\nm\u2217=\u03b1+(1\u2212\u03b1+\u03b2)X\u2032\nf\u2217. (20)\nUsing the above results, we \ufb01nd the modi\ufb01ed rate\nr=/radicalBigg\n2\n3\u03b11\n2+O(\u03b1,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7). (21)\nAssuming the mutation rate \u03b1does not change and remain \u03b1\u22433.3\u00d710\u22125as we \ufb01nd in the\nabove, we can determine X\u2032\nf\u2217= 0.00707. Also, we readily obtain the fractional populations:\nXX:X\u2032X:X\u2032X\u2032= 98.6 : 1.41 : 0, and XY:X\u2032Y= 993 : 7. The result clearly\nshows that the majority of hemophilia would results frominheritance and that the fractional\npopulation of carrier female increases drastically, when male hemoph iliac patients survive\nand mate without any disadvantages. Therefore, nongenetic tre atment of hemophiliac male\nmay cause increase of hemophiliac population and infant deaths of fe male patients, unless\nsome concurrent measures are taken. However, we note that th e present calculation can not\nproduce the dynamic properties of the transition period between \u03b4m\u22431 and\u03b4m\u22430, since\n\u03b4mis assumed static in the calculation.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nWe have considered the population ratios of the genetic groups rela ted with chromosome\ninherited diseases. The governing equations, which determine the r atios, are found in the\npresence of mutation and selection. The selection is taken into acco unt in the formulation\nby using the disadvantage factors. It is found that there exist ph ysical \ufb01xed points in the\nautomata equations, which correspond to equilibrium population rat es. These fractional\npopulation equations are used to discuss the cases of color blindnes s and hemophilia.\nIn the case of color blindness, there is no signi\ufb01cant disadvantage in selection so that the\ndisadvantage factors can be assumed zero. From the governing e quations, we readily obtain\nthe Hardy-Weinberg relation XX:X\u2032X:X\u2032X\u2032=\u03b22: 2\u03b1\u03b2:\u03b12. Using the statistical data\nXY:X\u2032Y= 12 : 1, we \ufb01nd that the ratio of mutation rates \u03b1:\u03b2= 1 : 12.\nHemophilia seriously hampers chances of survival, mating and reprod uction. Especially\nfor female patients, chance of survival is almost zero, thus, makin g\u03b4f= 1. Using the\n6\ndemographic data that one out of ten thousand male infants have h emophilia, and that one\nthird of all hemophiliac cases are thought to be caused by gene muta tion, we obtain the\nfollowing results; i) the disadvantage factor \u03b4mfor male is almost 1, ii) the mutation rate\n\u03b1\u22433.3\u00d710\u22125, and iii) XX:X\u2032X\u2243104: 1.33.\nWe have also studied the case when the hemophiliac male su\ufb00ers no disa dvantage in the\nselection process; \u03b4m= 0. It is found that the population of hemophiliac females and males\nwould increase drastically and inheritary hemophilia would be dominant o ver gene mutated\ncases.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work has been partly supported by the Korea Ministry of Educa tion (Grant No.\nBSRI-97-2425) and the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation through Project No.\n95-0701-04-01-3 and also through the SRC program of SNU-CTP.\n7\nFIGURES\n01e-42e-43e-4\n2e-64e-66e-68e-61e-5\n0.20.40.60.8X'f*\n\u03b1\n\u03b4mFigure 1\nFIG. 1.

To accompli sh this, we introduce\na model which explicitly incorporates both solvation e\ufb00ect s and the angular\ndependence (on the protein backbone) of hydrogen bond forma tion. The ther-\nmodynamics of this model is studied by exploring the density of states for the\nentire system and the local couplings in a partially folded s tructure. Our results\nsuggest that solvation dynamics together with the H-bond an gular dependence\ngives rise to a generic cooperativity in this class of system s; this result ex-\nplains why pathological aggregates involving \u03b2-sheet cores can form from many\ndi\ufb00erent proteins.

On the other hand, the precursors of amyloidogenesis are c ommonly found to have\na\u03b2-sheet organization1; moreover, a conformational rearrangement can switch a funct ional\n\u03b2-sheet into an aggregation unit2,3. As they play the role of stabilizing highly organized\n2\narchitectures (eitherpathologicalorfunctional), \u03b2-sheetsmustbestronglycooperativeunits,\nresponsible for lowering the free energy of these folded structur es as compared to entropy-\ndominated more irregular patterns.\nIt is often assumed that hydrophobic interactions are the major f orces contributing to\n\u03b2-sheet cooperativity and their interacting pattern (i.e., the seque nce design) can de\ufb01ne a\nunique fold4. But, one cannot ignore the fact that many neurodegenerative d iseases are\ncaused by the aggregation of mutant proteins with long hydrophilic sequences (e.g., poly-\nglutamine in Huntington disease5); the\u03b2-sheet at the core of these aggregates are certainly\nnot being stabilized by hydrophobic forces. Indeed, recent exper iments have shown that\npeptides with purely hydrophilic sequences can fold \u03b2-sheets cooperatively6. Also, growing\nevidence suggests that proteins are capable of forming \u03b2-sheet aggregates, regardless of their\nnative folds7. Together with the fact that most amyloidogenetic precursors do not share\nany homologous sequence1, it is therefore very likely that throughout the 2-dimensional \u03b2-\nsheet architecture, formation of an H-bond network can genera te long-range ordering, hence\ncompensating the mismatch of side-chain interactions and stabilizing the system.\nWhat are the basic di\ufb00erences between backbone H-bond and side- chain hydrophobic\ninteractions? Besides the di\ufb00erence in sequence speci\ufb01city discuss ed above, they also di\ufb00er\nin the maximal number of contacts for each interaction unit. Along t he peptide chain,\none amino acid can form at most two backbone H-bonds with adjacen t\u03b2-strands in the\n2-dimensional \u03b2-sheet structure. In contrast, for each hydrophobic residue in a compact\nprotein, thenumber offavorable(sequence speci\ufb01c)contactsc anbemorethantwo; thisleads\nto many-body e\ufb00ects that can de\ufb01ne and stabilize a unique fold4,8,9. In most protein folding\nliterature, thehydrophobic many-body e\ufb00ect ismimicked bytheuse ofG\u00af o-typeinteraction10\nand sequence-speci\ufb01c restrictions on the backbone energy11to favor the native state. This\napproach, however, is not generally applicable to the case of seque nce-independent \u03b2-sheet\nformation.\nMoreover, from a statistical mechanics prospective, it is well know n that having coop-\nerative behavior in a 2-dimensional, pairwise-interacting system req uires more than two\ncouplings (in average) for each interaction unit12. In protein folding, this corresponds to the\ncase that folding of a speci\ufb01c part of the overall structure will aid it s contiguous contact\nformation without redundant entropy loss, as brie\ufb02y discussed by Berrizet al13. At the \ufb01rst\nglance, this principle does not apply to the case of H-bond network f ormation in an obvious\n3\nway. Thus, elucidating how the networking of individual H-bond can g ive rise to a stable\nfolded structure is the major goal of present work.\nFor this purpose, we study a model system without speci\ufb01c side-ch ain interaction. It\nhas already been shown that for \u03b2-structured proteins with randomly assigned sequences,\na pure Lennard-Jones potential might not be su\ufb03cient to provide s ystemic cooperativity,14\nand angular dependence in contact formation must be taken into ac count13. Also, there is\ngrowing evidence that solvent e\ufb00ects play a signi\ufb01cant role in protein folding and conforma-\ntional changes15,16,17,18,19. Thus, we introduce a new approach to integrate these two e\ufb00ect s\nin modeling H-bond formation. The ingredients of our approach are a \u201cco-plane\u201d parame-\nterization of the backbone degrees of freedom with explicit coupling s of solvation dynamics\nand the angular dependence of hydrogen-bond formation. The sy stemic cooperativity is\ninvestigated by exploring the density of states for \u03b2-sheets of di\ufb00erent size and structure.\nTo facilitate the sampling, we have used replica-exchange20and multi-canonical rescaling21\ntechniques. The originof thisglobal cooperativity isfurther studie d bycomparing energetics\nand thermodynamic stability of local sub-structures of model sys tems with di\ufb00erent types\nof interaction potentials.\nOur results indicate that it is the de-solvation cavity formation (i.e., t he granularity\nof the water molecule) and the hydrogen-bond angular dependenc e that provide \u03b2-sheets\nwith a systemic cooperativity. Since this property is sequence-inde pendent, our results\nsuggest why \u03b2-sheets can generically serve as the building blocks for constructin g functional\nmacromolecules, and why most functional proteins have the tende ncy to form aggregates at\nsu\ufb03ciently high concentration.\nII. METHOD\nA. The model system\nThe system proposed here is based on the \u201cball-and-stick\u201d model in troduced in Ref. 22.\nIn this approach, all NH, C \u03b1, CO (represented as C\u2032), and C \u03b2side-chains are treated as\nlumped balls. The local backbone energy consists of a sum of terms:\n1. bond bending: V \u03b8=1\n2/summationtextk\u03b8(\u03b8i\u2212\u03b80)2\n4\n2. dihedral rotations: V \u03c9=1\n2/summationtext\u01eb\u03c9(1+cos\u03c9i), V\u03c6=1\n2/summationtext\u01eb\u03c6(1+cos3\u03c6i), V\u03c8=1\n2/summationtext\u01eb\u03c8(1+\ncos3\u03c8i),\n3. side-chain chirality: V chiral=/summationtext\u01ebchiral\u0398/parenleftbig/braceleftbig\n[\u02c6rNC\u03b1\u00d7\u02c6rC\u03b2C\u03b1]\u00b7\u02c6rC\u2032C\u03b1/bracerightbig\ni/parenrightbig\nwith the sum taken over all components (labeled by i), and \u0398(s) = (s+|s|)/2. Here, since\nwe are interested in sequence-independent e\ufb00ects, all side-chain s are treated as polar or\nweakly charged groups that favor \u03b2-sheet formation, with interaction strengths4,26that are\nfar less than the magnitude of the H-bond energy and can be gener ally ignored. Also, we\ntake the parameters k\u03b8= 200kcal/mol\u00b7rad2,\u01eb\u03c9= 40kcal/mol,\u01eb\u03c6=\u01eb\u03c8= 0.45kcal/mol, and\n\u01ebchiral= 10kcal/mol from Ref. 22.\nB. The solvation force \ufb01eld\nNext, we construct expressions for the non-local interactions. We incorporate the sol-\nvation e\ufb00ect into the force law by designing a double-well potential t hat can account for\ncontact formation and single-H 2O hydration (between the contact pair); the barrier between\nthe wells corresponds to the free energy cost involved in the trans fer of a water molecule out\nof the hydration shell15,23. Multiple shells could be accommodated via a multiple-well po-\ntential, but this is not attempted here. The approximation of using a n e\ufb00ective free-energy\nis justi\ufb01ed via the observation that transfer of water from within t he vicinity of the contact\npair is faster than the contact formation15,16,17,18.\nThere is no standard way to construct a continuous de/solvation p otential24which can\nbe used for Langevin simulations; we note that a previous curve \ufb01tt ing e\ufb00ort25and a recent\nMonte Carlo study23utilized a discrete version of such a potential. We therefore propos e an\nempirical pro\ufb01le based on estimated experimental parameters. Sp eci\ufb01cally, we will take for\nH-bond formation\nUHb(r) =A\nrk/bracketleftBigg\n1\n4r3k\u2212/parenleftbigg1\n(rc\nHb)k+1\n(r\u2217\nHb)k+1\n(rsol\nHb)k/parenrightbigg1\n3r2k\n+/bracketleftbigg/parenleftbigg1\n(rc\nHb)k+1\n(r\u2217\nHb)k/parenrightbigg1\n(rsol\nHb)k+1\n(rc\nHbr\u2217\nHb)k/bracketrightbigg1\n2rk\u22121\n(rc\nHbr\u2217\nHbrsol\nHb)k/bracketrightBigg\n(1)\nHereris the distance between NH and CO, and the integer k\u2208N(k= 6, e.g.) is chosen\nto give speci\ufb01c long-range behavior. The values r=rc\nHb,r=r\u2217\nHb, andr=rsol\nHbrepresent the\n5\nseparation distance at the contact bond position, at the the peak of the desolvation barrier,\nand in the presence of a single intervening solvent molecule separatio n, respectively. rsol\nHb\nis obtained by adding the known value of rc\nHbto the size of a single H 2O.Aandr\u2217\nHbcan\nbe determined by the strengths of the H-bond22and the desolvation barrier; the latter is\napproximated by the surface energy involved in forming a desolvatio n cavity, estimated to\nequal\u22480.103kcal/(mol\u25e6\nA2)18. Here we have rc\nHb\u22483.43\u25e6\nAandr\u2217\nHb\u22483.92\u25e6\nA; these yield a\nsingle H 2O hydration energy of \u2248 \u22120.5 kcal/mol.\nClearly, the design principle behind this type of formula is to have thre e roots for\ndUHb(r)/dr= 0 accounting for the desolvation barrier and for the two local minim a; one can\nadd more roots to address multiple solvation shell e\ufb00ects. Note tha t one might wish to \ufb01ne-\ntune the potential pro\ufb01le more precisely (for instance, by being ab le to independently vary\nthe width of the contact well). This can be accomplished by a more com plicated expression\n(see appendix A). Also, the strength of de/solvation might depend on the hydrophobicity of\nlocal environment (i.e., de-wetting behavior) and one can certainly t ake this into account.\nAs discussed in22,26, hydrogen bond formation has a strong angular dependence on its\nsurrounding backbone; thus, one can not fully describe the intera ction using the radial\ndistance alone. From Fig. 1(d), we note that such an angular depen dence is merely the\nrequirement that all atoms near to the interacting NH, CO (i.e. the s hadowed area) are\naligned \u201cnatively\u201d. In Ref. 22, this \u201calignment\u201d e\ufb00ect is accomplished by introducing\narti\ufb01cial repulsive forces between H-bondneighbors. Here, we pr oposeinstead a \u201cfunctional-\nblock\u201d (co-plane) scheme.\nC. The co-plane approach\nFrom Fig. 1(a), we notice that the peptide backbone between two c ontiguous C \u03b1atoms\nhas a co-planar structure because of the N-C-O bond resonance . This allows us to model the\nmotion of a \u201cco-plane\u201d as a whole (i.e., with one dihedral angle \u03c9\ufb01xed to\u2248180\u25e6). Overall,\neach interacting unit in our system is just one block of C \u03b1co-plane. The ithco-plane is\nde\ufb01ned by three points {X(i)\n1,X(i)\n2,X(i)\n3}where X(i)\n1,X(i)\n3are simply the two C \u03b1in the plane\nand X(i)\n2is a virtual point satisfying\u2212 \u2212\u2212\u2212 \u2192\nX(i)\n1X(i)\n2\u22a5\u2212 \u2212\u2212\u2212 \u2192\nX(i)\n2X(i)\n3, \ufb01g.1(b). Once the degree of freedom\ncorresponding to this point is speci\ufb01ed, all the atomic locations of th e amide and carbonyl\ngroups are \ufb01xed. Note that a convenient way to de\ufb01ne the arbitra ry point X 2is such that\n6\nthe vector\u2212 \u2212\u2212\u2212 \u2192\nX(i)\n2X(i)\n3points directly at the C \u03b1of the neighboring strand if the system is in\nthe native\u03b2-sheet structure; see \ufb01g.1(c). Once X(i)\n2is chosen, this determines the in-plane\nangles\u03b81and\u03b82as well as the virtual plane projection angle \u03b83. We computed all these\nobjects by using the native value of bond angles22and dihedral angles observed in regular\n\u03b2-sheets (\u03c6\u223c \u2212138\u00b11\u25e6,\u03c8\u223c135\u00b11\u25e6)26. This leads to all geometrical properties of the\nvirtual plane, including \u03b81= 64.7\u25e6,\u03b82= 62.2\u25e6,\u03b83= 22.4\u25e6,X1X2= 3.75\u25e6\nA,X2X3= 0.57\u25e6\nA.\nGiven the native plane, we de\ufb01ne the range of possible non-native st ructures via allowing\nthe orientation of the planes to vary. This yields three degrees of f reedom per residue; two\nre\ufb02ect the angles needed to de\ufb01ne the direction of the \ufb01xed length vector going from one C\u03b1\nto the next while the third refers to a rolling of the plane around this v ector. One can then\nwork out the geometrical problem of expressing, in terms of these degrees of freedom, the\nresidual terms in the backbone energy arising from the dihedral te rms involving \u03c6and\u03c8, the\nbendingofthebondangle \u2220C\u2032C\u03b1N, andtheside-chainchiralitiesbetweenconsecutiveblocks.\nOur approach fully maintains the overall translation and rotational degrees of freedom of\nthe protein molecule. This co-plane parameterization greatly reduc es our computation e\ufb00ort\nas compared to all atom backbones, yet maintains the roll degree o f freedom not present in\nthe simpli\ufb01ed C \u03b1model. As will be shown later, this degree of freedom is important for the\nstudy of\u03b2-sheet cooperativity.\nD. The structural factor\nNow we use the co-plane approach to model the H-bond angular dep endence. From\n\ufb01g.1(e), we note that having a H-bond between blocks i,jrequires \ufb01xing two rotational and\ntwo translational degrees of freedom. More precisely, we need\u2212 \u2212\u2212\u2212 \u2192\nX(i)\n1X(i)\n2antiparallel to\u2212 \u2212\u2212\u2212 \u2192\nX(j)\n1X(j)\n2,\nand\u2212 \u2212\u2212\u2212 \u2192\nX(i)\n2X(i)\n3parallel to\u2212 \u2212\u2212\u2212 \u2192\nX(j)\n2X(j)\n3, whereas for translational alignment, the two sets of points\n{X(i)\n1,X(j)\n2,X(j)\n3}and{X(j)\n1,X(i)\n3,X(i)\n2}must be collinear. This leads us to de\ufb01ne a structural\nfactor that monitors the angular nativeness in the H-bond\nx(i,j)\nHb= =1\n16/bracketleftbigg\n1\u2212/hatwidestX(i)\n12\u00b7/hatwidestX(j)\n12/bracketrightbigg/bracketleftbigg\n1+/hatwidestX(i)\n23\u00b7/hatwidestX(j)\n23/bracketrightbigg\n\u00d7/bracketleftBig\n1+cos\u2220X(j)\n2X(i)\n1X(j)\n3/bracketrightBig/bracketleftBig\n1+cos\u2220X(i)\n2X(j)\n1X(i)\n3/bracketrightBig\n(2)\nwhere/hatwidestX(k)\nabis the unit vector connecting X(k)\na,X(k)\nb. Note that x(i,j)\nHbhas maximum of 1 only\nwhen all the alignment criteria are satis\ufb01ed.\n7\nWe now wish to incorporate this structural factor into the Hamilton ian in such a manner\nas to ensure that at small xHb, the two interacting blocks are unlikely to form H-bond. A\nsimple phenomenological way to proceed is to introduce a potential p ro\ufb01le which has two\nparameters dynamically modulated by xHbwith a \ufb01xed solvation energy Esol\nUHb(r,xHb) =A(xHb)\nrk/bracketleftBigg\n1\n4r3k\u2212/parenleftbigg1\nrx\nHbk+1\n(r\u2217\nHb)k+1\n(rsol\nHb)k/parenrightbigg1\n3r2k\n+/bracketleftbigg/parenleftbigg1\nrx\nHbk+1\n(r\u2217\nHb)k/parenrightbigg1\n(rsol\nHb)k+1\n(rx\nHbr\u2217\nHb)k/bracketrightbigg1\n2rk\u22121\n(rx\nHbr\u2217\nHbrsol\nHb)k/bracketrightBigg\n(3)\nHere the \ufb01rst dynamical parameter A(xHb) is determined by \ufb01xing U Hb(rsol\nHb,xHb) =Esoland\nfor another parameter, we have used a linear relation rx\nHb=xHbrc\nHb+(1\u2212xHb)r\u2217\nHb. Examples\nof this modulated double-well pro\ufb01le areshown in \ufb01g.2(a). Note that even incorporated with\nthis structural factor, the H-bond potential still remains pairwis e between two interacting\nblocks.\nAside from the NH \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7OC hydrogen bond, we include in our model the bonding between\nC\u03b1-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O=C27. This interaction has a strong chirality22and an angular dependence that\ninvolves at least two contiguous blocks. From \ufb01g.1(d), we note that the native con\ufb01guration\nfor interacting, consecutive blocks i,i+ 1 andj,j+ 1 (herei(j) + 1 is the block next to\ni(j) along the same strand) requires/hatwidestX(i)\n23(/hatwidestX(j)\n23) antiparallel to/hatwiderX(i+1)\n23(/hatwiderX(j+1)\n23). Therefore, in\nanalogy to the aforementioned H-bond ,we propose a structural f actor for this additional\ninteraction\nx(i,j)\nchiral=1\n4xHb(i,j)xHb(i+1,j+1)/bracketleftbigg\n1\u2212/hatwidestX(i)\n23\u00b7/hatwiderX(i+1)\n23/bracketrightbigg/bracketleftbigg\n1\u2212/hatwidestX(j)\n23\u00b7/hatwiderX(j+1)\n23/bracketrightbigg\n(4)\nwith an interaction potential U C\u03b1H\u2212OC(r,xchiral) taken to be similar to U Hb(r,xHb). We use\na C\u03b1-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O=C interaction strength half that of a single H-bond27.\nE. The role of the force \ufb01eld\nTo characterize the roles of structural factors and solvation e\ufb00 ects in\u03b2-sheet formation,\nwe have studied four di\ufb00erent forms of the H-bond potential. Thes e are:\n\u2022(A) LJfix:Ufix\nLJ(r) =|EHb|(rc\nHb)6\nr6/bracketleftBig\n(rc\nHb)6\nr6\u22122/bracketrightBig\n, a L-J potential without angular depen-\ndence.\n8\n\u2022(B) Solfix:Ufix\nSol(r)\u21d2eqn.(1), a double-well solvation potential without angular\ndependence.\n\u2022(C) LJang:Uang\nLJ(r) =ALJ(xHb)[rLJ(xHb)]6\nr6/bracketleftBig\n[rLJ(xHb)]6\nr6\u22122/bracketrightBig\n, a 2-dynamical-parameter L-\nJ potential with our proposed angular dependence. This pro\ufb01le is de signed to help\ndistinguish the e\ufb00ects of solvation and structural factors. Thus , except for the ab-\nsence of a desolvation barrier, this potential is quite similar to the so lvation one,\neqn.(3). Explicitly, we let a non-native alignment factor xHb<1 give rise to a\nlinear shift |Uang\nLJ(rLJ(xHb))|=ALJ(xHb) =xHb|EHb|+ (1\u2212xHb)|Esol|for the \ufb01rst\nparameter. Also, to achieve a repulsive e\ufb00ect similar to that in eqn.(3 ), we set\nUang\nLJ(rx\nHb) = UHb(rx\nHb,xHb), i.e.,rLJ(xHb) =rx\nHb(1+/radicalbig\n1+UHb(rx\nHb,xHb)/ALJ(xHb))1/6\nfor the second parameter.

The local melting approach\nAside from examining the global cooperativity, we have also explored the thermody-\nnamics of local binding events in the model system. The idea is that in t he absence of\n10\nhydrophobic clustering, the system cooperativity (if any) must ar ise from a scaling up of\nsmall scale bound structures. In other words, folding of a speci\ufb01c part of the overall struc-\nture will be aided by any contiguous folded regions28; this can be investigated by exploring\nthe conditional probabilities of residues of being folded (i.e., in their na tive position and\norientation) or unfolded depending on whether their neighbors are folded or unfolded (i.e.,\nthe contact correlations). Speci\ufb01cally, we investigated two cases ; the ensemble that has all\nblocks retained in their folded con\ufb01gurations aside from either a) a f ew blocks at the end of\none\u03b2-strand or b) a few blocks buried inside the sheet.\nTo study these local sub-structures, we have assumed here tha t their thermodynamics\nwill not be a\ufb00ected signi\ufb01cantly by the dynamics of very distant block s. This allows us to\ncompute a \u201cconditional\u201d partition function in which, except for thos e speci\ufb01ed blocks, the\nrest can be treated as frozen in their native positions. Doing this, t he number of degrees\nof freedom is signi\ufb01cantly reduced and the conditional partition fun ction can be obtained\nby explicit numerical integration. For instance, in the single-block \u03b2-tail case, the partition\nfunction reads/integraltext\ndX2dX3\u03b4(X1X2\u2212X1X2N)\u03b4(X2X3\u2212X2X3N)e\u2212H/kBTwhereX1X2N= 3.75\u25e6\nA,\nX2X3N= 0.57\u25e6\nAare native constants, and X 2, X3are the virtual points of the movable\nterminal block (note that its X 1is \ufb01xed). Then, because of the \u03b4functions, the partition\nfunction is reduced to an integral over three angles de\ufb01ning the or ientation of the terminal\nplane.\nIII. RESULTS\nA. Global Cooperativity\nThe \ufb01rst system we studied is a 3-strand \u03b2-sheet with a total of 6 H-bonds equally\ndistributed between adjacent strands. Since there is no sequenc e speci\ufb01city, we arti\ufb01cially\ntethered the H-bonds at the 2 expected turns to maintain the \u03b2-sheet propensity. In Fig. 3,\nwe show the computed speci\ufb01c heat for the four di\ufb00erent model fo rces. Basically, we found\nthat there is no sharp transition for the three models LJfix, LJang, Solfixif non-speci\ufb01c\nH-bonds are allowed to develop on the peptide backbone; this is beca use their dominant low-\nenergy states are ensembles with non-speci\ufb01c, randomly collapsed structures rather than a\nuniquely de\ufb01ned \u03b2-sheet (similar to the results observed by Guo & Brooks14). The complete\n11\nmodel Solang, however, can de\ufb01ne a unique native state and give rise to a sharp t ransition,\nas seen in Fig. 3(a).\nNext, we added a G\u00af o-like restriction to the models LJfix, LJang, Solfix, i.e., allowing\nH-bond formation only between those residues that have such an in teraction in the native\n\u03b2-sheet structure10. Of course, the entire justi\ufb01cation of this approach is absent in sy stems\nwith homogeneous interaction as the one of primary concern here, but it is still worthwhile\ncomparing the results of our proposed complete model with these a lternatives. Note how-\never that our G\u00af o-like restriction does not include any additional re strictions on backbone\ncon\ufb01gurations to favor a particular structure (i.e., native state) ; this is very di\ufb00erent from\nthe energetic restrictions commonly used in the o\ufb00-lattice protein f olding literature11. In\nFig. 3(b), we show that even with G\u00af o-like restrictions to reduce th e non-speci\ufb01c collapsed\nensemble, the LJfixmodel can not give rise to a sharp transition compared with models\nincorporating either the de/solvation e\ufb00ect or angular dependenc y. This is consistent with\nresults from other group13and also the aforementioned reasoning that with only two contact\ncouplings foreach interacting unit, a simple force\ufb01eld forH-bondfo rmationcannot produce\nsystemic cooperativity.\nThe di\ufb00erence between the various force models becomes much clea rer in larger systems.\nFig. 3(c) shows the speci\ufb01c heat diagrams for a 4-strand \u03b2-sheet with a total of 15 H-bonds\nequally distributed between adjacent strands. Now, without a sign i\ufb01cant increase in the\ntransition temperature, the peak magnitude of the speci\ufb01c heat f or model Solangis 100 fold\nlarger than that of the previous small system, whereas there is st ill no signi\ufb01cant transition\nfor the L-J G\u00af o-like potential. This di\ufb00erence is further realized by e xamining the density of\nstates. In Fig. 4(a), we note that there is only one dominant ensem ble for model LJfixin\nthe low-energy region; this ensemble mixes the native and partially fo lded states. In model\nLJang, on the other hand, the unfolded ensemble ( E\u223c0) is slightly separated from the\nfolded one; however, the folded phase has a larger entropy than t hat of the unfolded state,\nand thus there is no transition. In the solvation model, as shown in Fig . 4(b), there is a\nclear separation between the folded and unfolded ensemble, with th e unfolded states having\nthe largest entropy, as is crucial for having a sharp transition.\nApparently, boththe angular dependence andsolvation e\ufb00ect sligh tly enhance the system\ncooperativity, but only a combination of both can yield the desired re sults in the system of\nprimary concern here. This point has not been adequately address ed in previous works13,14.\n12\nAlso, we notice a high energy population appearing in model LJang, Solfix, and Solang. Ana-\nlyzing the contact pro\ufb01le in this additional phase, we found that its d ominant con\ufb01gurations\nare those with signi\ufb01cant intervening of folding and unfolding in the en tire structure, i.e.,\n\u201cdroplet\u201d-like structures28,29. As will be elucidated in next section, this intervening can lead\nto an interfacial energetic penalty resulting from backbone twistin g (enhanced by the an-\ngular dependence) and (re)-desolvation barrier crossing at the in terface between contiguous\nfolded and unfolded regions; thus the partially unfolded ensemble is s hifted from low energy\n(as in model LJfix) to the high energy region. Consequently, the completely folded an d\nunfolded ensemble are well separated, leading to a sharp transition .\nOf course, whether these partially folded droplet con\ufb01gurations c an be shifted to high\nenergy depends not only on the choice of the H-bond potential (to create the interfacial\npenalty), but also the topology of the \u03b2-sheet. When the H-bond energy inside the folded\ndroplet can compensate the interfacial penalty, the structure w ill no longer stay at high-\nenergy phase. To show this explicitly, we studied a system that is less symmetric on the\n\u03b2-sheet plane; we chose a 3-strand \u03b2-sheet with long strands, looking at the e\ufb00ect of in-\ncreasing the strand length. We started with a 3-strand \u03b2-sheet with a total of 30 H-bonds\nequally distributed between adjacent strands. Fig. 5(a,b) shows it sn(E) and speci\ufb01c heat,\nwhich are very similar to those of the 4-strand, 15 H-bond system, in that they both have\nwell-separated unfolded/native states, and partially unfolded high -energy populations. An-\nalyzing the states in the low and high energy partially folded ensembles , we found that their\ndominant con\ufb01gurations are droplets with one (in the low energy pha se) or multiple (in the\nhigh energy phase) interfaces between contiguous un/folded reg ions, i.e., a partially folded\n\u03b2-sheet (or hairpin) buried in unfolded coils (illustrated by examples in F ig. 5(a)).\nWhenthesystem size increases toatotalof40H-bonds, however , (see Fig.6(a,b)), we\ufb01nd\nan increased weight for the partially folded ensemble in the low energy phase ranging from\n0>E >E NwhereENis the native state energy. Unlike the smaller, or symmetric system,\nhere the interfacial energy penalty between contiguous un/folde d regions, can not compete\nwith the large H-bond energy at the bulky folded portion; this allows t he partially folded\nensemble tohavealowenergy. Moreover, inasystem withsuch anelo ngatedasymmetry, the\npartiallyfoldedportioncanfreelymove alongthe \u03b2-sheet, orfreely slidealongthechain with\nmany \u201cmis-pairing\u201d H-bonds (i.e., inconsistent with native pairing). Bo th e\ufb00ects can then\nincrease the entropy of the partially folded (or even misfolded) ens emble and hence smears\n13\nout the separation between completely un/folded ensemble and par tially folded ensemble,\nFig. 6(a). The smearing becomes more signi\ufb01cant in a larger 3-stran d\u03b2-sheet with a\ntotal of 50 H-bonds, Fig. 6(c). As a consequence, the system be comes less cooperative\nand an additional continuous transition occurs between these par tially un/folded ensemble,\n\ufb01g.6(b,c). Developing a phenomenological model based on these res ults to study how the\nsystem cooperativity depends on the \u03b2-sheet topology, therefore, is one of our future goals.\nB. Local Bonding E\ufb00ects\nIn this section, we examine how the model system acquires \u201cglobal\u201d c ooperativity (in\nthe absence of hydrophobic clustering) by exploring the thermody namic e\ufb00ects of local\nun/bonding. Here, since we are dealing with only a small number of deg rees of freedom, we\ncouldcalculateallthermodynamicpropertiesbyexplicitintegrationo fthepartitionfunction.\nAs an illustration, we \ufb01rst present the results of the single-block \u03b2-tail case, Fig. 7, where\nwe plotted the probability distribution function (pdf) P(r) of the interacting distance rin\nthe native NH \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7OC pair between the terminal block (the one allowed to \ufb02uctuate) an d its\nnative partner (taken to be frozen in space).\nIn this case, the maximum possible NH \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7OC distance as determined by the range of\nintegration, is smaller than that necessary to \ufb01t a water molecule in b etween and thus there\ncannot be any true secondary solvated minimum. We do see however the fact that having\nthe solvation barrier and (to a lesser extent) the angular factors make a big di\ufb00erence in\nthe structure of P(r). Speci\ufb01cally, there is no hint of well-separated 2-state behavior f or\nmodel LJfix. However, a small barrier appears if the potential has an angular d ependence\n(modelLJang), andbecomessigni\ufb01cant ifsolvatione\ufb00ectsareincluded(modelSo lfix, Solang).\nHere, we note that because of the bond angle \u2220C\u2032C\u03b1N potential, P(r) is concentrated on\nthe \u201cring\u201d that satis\ufb01es \u2220C\u2032C\u03b1N =\u2220C\u2032C\u03b1Nnative. On this ring, only a few \u201cpoints\u201d will\ngive minimal dihedral angle ( \u03c8,\u03c6) energies. These points correspond to the sharp peaks in\n\ufb01g.7 that have free energy di\ufb00erence \u2248\u01eb\u03c8+\u01eb\u03c6\u22481kcal/mol from their surrounding; if we\nreduce the bond angle sti\ufb00ness k\u03b8, these sharp peaks become broadened (data not shown).\nApparently, this e\ufb00ect comes from the backbone energy and is inde pendent of the choice of\nH-bond potential.\nNext, we studied the\u201cburied\u201d cases with nblocks allowed to \ufb02uctuate. In this situation,\n14\nthe con\ufb01gurations of \ufb02uctuating blocks are clearly constrained to a great extent by their\n\ufb01xed neighbors. Thus, we found that for n= 1, there is neither 2-state behavior nor any\nqualitative di\ufb00erence among the results of di\ufb00erent force \ufb01elds (da ta not shown); all signi\ufb01-\ncant probability is con\ufb01ned in the H-bond well, indicating a strong topo logical con\ufb01nement\ntoforcethefoldingofasingleunfoldedblockburiedamidst foldedone s. Whenn= 2, westill\ndo not have enough freedom of backbone motion to allow for a solvat ed second minimum for\nthe main H-bond; the maximum separation is slightly above 4.1\u25e6\nA, Fig. 8(a). Nonetheless,\nwe see clear di\ufb00erences among di\ufb00erent models. For the simplest LJfixmodel, there is no\ncon\ufb01nement to a narrow contact well. Adding the angular factor ba ck in, we create a barrier\nas the NH \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7OC distance is increased. This barrier is due to the modulation of the L J po-\ntential by the angular factor, making it repulsive if the orientation is not properly matched.\nAlternatively, adding the solvation e\ufb00ect as in model Solfixalso introduces a barrier; this is\nbecause rolling of the co-plane allows for a wide separation (and henc e going up and down\nthe solvation barrier) in the C \u03b1H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7OC interactions. Finally, putting both e\ufb00ects in leads\nto a very large degree of con\ufb01nement in the H-bond well, suggesting that local coupling is\nenhanced by both structural and solvation e\ufb00ects such that an u nfolded block is strongly\nbiased to fold if contiguous to folded ones.\nTo further characterize the di\ufb00erence between the varying choic es of force models, we\nexplored the un/folding correlation in the 2-block buried case. Spec i\ufb01cally, we computed\nthe conditional probability function P(r) for one block with respect to the un/folding state\nof another (de\ufb01ned as folded/unfolded if its native H-bond separa tionr2\u2277r\u2217\nHb),P(r1|r2>\nr\u2217\nHb),P(r1|r2<r\u2217\nHb), wherer1,r2are their native H-bond separations, respectively. In other\nwords, if the system has a good local coupling, un/folding of one bloc k should force the\nun/folding of another, implying a well-separated P(r1|r2\u2277r\u2217\nHb). In Fig. 8(b), however,\nwe found that P(r1|r2\u2277r\u2217\nHb) are well separated only in model Solang. Here, the separated\nprobability distributions have been individually normalized; the actual probability for being\nat the larger ris extremely small as is evident from Fig. 8(a). Also, note that it is not r\nin the \ufb01gure which is important - this H-bond separation is quite small. I nstead, the two\npeakscorrespond toeither having thefullH-bondenergy(bysat isfyingboththedistance and\nangular conditions) or not having that energy; the distribution at la rgerrdoes not have the\ncorrect angular con\ufb01guration. To clarify this point, we plotted the conditional probability\nfunction on the variation of H-bond energy Einstead of distance r, i.e.,P(E1(r1)|r2>\n15\nr\u2217\nHb),P(E1(r1)|r2<r\u2217\nHb), Fig. 8(b). Now, we see clearly that only the full model Solanghas\na signi\ufb01cant separation e\ufb00ect.\nC. Collective Re-solvation Kinetics\nThe conclusion from the local coupling studies is that the full model b eing proposed here\nleads to strong correlations between the behaviors of neighboring blocks. For the system as\na whole, this should mean that complicated con\ufb01gurations with repea ted interfaces between\nunfolded and folded residues would cause additional energetic pena lties and thus can be\nstrongly suppressed in favor of simpler con\ufb01gurations with large pa tches of residues being\neither all in contact or all not in contact. Of course, whether the s ystem can therefore\nacquire an global cooperativity would depend on its topology as well, a s revealed in earlier\nsection.\nNow, the interesting part of this conclusion, as will be illustrated late r, is that during\nunfolding (folding), the solvation (desolvation) process must occu r in a collective way. To\nsee this explicitly, we show the pdf and re-solvation kinetics of a 10-b lock buried case in Fig.\n9(a,b). Because of the large barrier needed to melt the blocks, her e we set the simulation\ntemperature far beyond the physiological range.\nFrom Fig. 9(a) (using Solang), we note that the pdf of native H-bond distances are well\nseparated by a free energy (- kBTlnP(r)) barrier, resulting in an ordered (H-bond formed)\nand disordered (H-bond not formed) phases. Interestingly, eve n governed by the same force\nlaw, the un/folding barriers for the various molten blocks are not qu ite the same. For blocks\nclose to the con\ufb01ned ones (those frozen in the space), the barrie r progressively increases, and\nthe disordered phase becomes less signi\ufb01cant. This reduction of dis ordered phase manifests\na stronger folding bias for any unfolded residues near those folded ones. Thus it is not\ne\ufb00ective to unbind the blocks one by one, since the unbound block will rebind long before\nits neighbor has unbound. This can be seen in the high-temperature unfolding simulation,\nFig. 9(b), in which we note that the resolvation (i.e., in\ufb01ltration of wat er molecules) process\ninvolved many residues simultaneously. In Fig. 9(c), we show that th is collective water\nin\ufb01ltration indeed occurs in unfolding of the entire \u03b2-sheet.\n16\nIV. DISCUSSION\nWehave explored themechanism of \u03b2-sheet cooperativitywithout side-chain interactions,\nwith di\ufb00erent choices of the H-bond potential. Our results suggest that in the absence of\nhydrophobic clustering, the \u03b2-sheet cooperativity arises from a coupling of structural factor\n(contact angular dependence), protein de/solvation e\ufb00ects, an d the system topology. Since\nthis phenomenon is sequence-independent, the results can be con sidered to apply in general\nto\u03b2-sheet structures.\nGiven the coupling number for each H-bond interacting unit, our res ults di\ufb00er from most\n2-dimensional pairwise-interacting system, in that there the minima l number of coupling\nrequired for global cooperativity is larger than the one present he re. Thus, the coupling\nbetween backbone energy (the angular dependence) and pairwise H-bond interaction (in-\ncorporated with solvation dynamics) must yield a strong many-body e\ufb00ect, which has been\nargued to be crucial to produce systemic cooperativity in homogen eous system such as are\nthe primary concern here28. Apparently, our model system has a default many-body e\ufb00ect,\nthe dihedral con\ufb01nement via the corresponding terms in the backb one energy.\nAs illustrated in our study, when the system is close to the fully folded state, the dihedral\ncon\ufb01nement is strong enough to complete the folding (the n= 1-block case). However, it\nis too weak to con\ufb01ne the backbone collectively if there is a larger unf olded portion in the\n\u03b2-sheet, as illustrated in the pure Lennard-Jones potential case. Instead, it is the angular\ndependence which incorporates the contact strength into the ba ckbone Hamiltonian and\nthus ampli\ufb01es the con\ufb01nement. This leads to a competition with solvat ion dynamics; in\nother words, while the solvent tries to pull the interacting blocks ap art, the con\ufb01ning force\nampli\ufb01ed by folded neighbors can hold them back. As this behavior occ urs mainly between\ncontiguous un/folded regions, it creates an \u201cinterfacial\u201d energet ic penalty and the \u201cdroplet\u201d\npicture proposed in previous works28,29(now allowing a measurement the droplet surface\ntension). Consequently, in a partially folded structure, any small r egions of unfolded blocks\ncontiguous to folded ones are thermodynamically unfavorable and w ill be forced to fold\nor will unfold the folded ones28. Thus, while there has been a concentration of e\ufb00ort on\nunderstanding the role the sequence heterogeneity for protein f olding and design, we would\nlike to point out that this generic cooperativity buried in the \u03b2-sheet architecture can also\nserve as a building block to construct macromolecular structure. However, this same build ing\n17\nblock can also provides the mechanism for pathological aggregation .\nWhat then would be the physiological role and evolutionary principle of having sequence\nheterogeneity, in the presence of possible \u03b2-architectures? Certainly, with the fast time scale\n(of order of 0 .1 ns, estimated from our Langevin simulations) for a single C \u03b1block folding,\nany pre-folded \u03b2-architecture with ordered, exposed amide and carbonyl oxygen could lead\nto a seeding process and non-speci\ufb01cally precipitate surrounding u nfolded peptides; this\nhas been observed in the elongation process of amyloidogenesis3. The physiological role of\nheterogeneity, therefore, would be to either distort the orienta tion of exposed amide and\ncarbonyl groups into a non-aggregation competent form, or pro vide \u201chot\u201d nuclei to bias\nthe system into the native fold. Indeed, this idea has been veri\ufb01ed in a recent tryptophan\nzipper model30. Exploring the competition between native folding due to speci\ufb01c seq uence\nheterogeneity and pathological aggregation due to generic coope rativity is perhaps the most\nimportant direction for future study.\nAs a side point, to elucidate the e\ufb00ect of local un/binding, we have int roduced a local\nmelting method. This method can be further used to explore local nu cleation or de-solvation\nevents in any system lacking long-ranged spatial couplings. Also, ins tead of simulating\nall backbone atoms or a simpli\ufb01ed C \u03b1model, a functional block (co-plane) approach was\nproposed. This approach greatly reduces our computational e\ufb00o rt; however, it still keeps\nthe right angular degrees of freedom (missing in C \u03b1model) and gives rise to a structural\nfactor (i.e., backbone alignment) that helps account for \u03b2-sheet cooperativity.\nAlso, we have introduced an approach to de/solvation which can be u sed directly for\nLangevin simulations. It has been noticed that the (de)-solvation e \ufb00ects are important in\nprotein folding and functioning, but no standard model has been pr oposed15,16,17,18,19,23,24,25.\nAlso, we note that solvent dynamics can be regulated by system hyd rostatic pressure15.\nInterestingly, many adhesion and hemostasis-related proteins ar e very sensitive to shear\nstress and pressure change; perhaps a local de/re-solvation ev ent might trigger a cooperative\nconformational change which ultimately has large scale consequenc es19. Thus, microscopic\ncooperativity can be ampli\ufb01ed into a macroscopic response; this also needs to be explored\nin future work.\n18\nV. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nCG wishes to acknowledge Peter G.

Note the growth of\npartially folded ensemble (inset in (a)is a typical example of their con\ufb01gurations) at low-\nenergy phase and smears out the separation between unfolded an d the native states. This\ncan lead to an abrupt transition (with the native state) at low tempe rature phase (pointed\nby double arrows in (b)) and a continuous transition (with other high-energy unfolded\nstates) at high temperature phase (pointed by a single arrow in (b)). When the system size\nincreases to totally 50 H-bonds (c), the smearing becomes more signi\ufb01cant (arrow in (c))\nand the system eventually loses its cooperativity.\nFig.7The numerical results for the probability distribution function (pdf )P(r) of\nNH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7OC separation rof the \u201cmolten\u201d block respective to its native partner in the \u03b2-\ntail single-block case (indicated in the inserted diagram; black: froz en, gray: mobile).

Here, the interacting distance for\nformation of contact, desolvation barrier, and single-solvent sep aration are r=r0,r=r1,\nr=r2, with free energy amplitude D0,D1,D2, respectively, and the width of the contact\nwell is controlled by the span between r=rx0andr=rx1. Normally, r2is separated from\nr0by the size of a single water molecule. The integer m >2, on the other hand, is chosen\nfor the long-distance behavior, and the six unknowns B,h1,h2,A,b,scan be determined by\nD0,D1,D2,r0,r2and one continuity requirement (dU HB/dr atr=rx1).

This description is consistent w ith the so-called\nrotary binding-change mechanism, a milestone of functioni ng ATP synthase,\nand uses a stepping (driving) function associated with two s equences of time\ninstants, at which hydrolysis and synthesis reactions occu r. It is useful to\nanalyse experimental data and numerical simulations indee d predict corre-\nsponding dynamic behavior.\nPACS numbers: 05.60.-k, 05.40.-a, 87.10.+e\nRecently, the modeling of molecular motors - enzymes which transdu ce chemical energy\ninto directed mechanical motion - based on the idea of gaining useful work by recti\ufb01cation\nof zero-mean noise \ufb02uctuations has attracted considerable atte ntion [1] and several models\nexploiting the so-called ratchetmechanism have been elaborated (see, e.g., Refs. [2\u20139], to\n1\nmention a few). In this context, ATP (adenosinetriphosphate) sy nthase shown schematically\nin Fiq. 1, being a realistic molecular engine of great interest nowadays [10], should also be\nstudied from the point of view of biological physics [11]. This machinery is composed of\ntwo rotary motors: a membrane-embedded unit F 0and water-surrounded F 1-ATPase (also\ncalled F 1) connected by a coiled-coil \u03b3subunit. ATP synthase works as a reversible motor-\npump machine: the proton \ufb02ow through F 0is believed to create a clockwise (when F 1is\nviewed from the F 0side) torque that turns \u03b3, whereupon ATP molecules are sequentially\nsynthesized at three catalytic sites, one on each \u03b2subunit. Vice versa, ATP hydrolysis,\nwhich also occurs sequentially on \u03b2\u2019s, but in the opposite direction, has been demonstrated\nto make \u03b3rotate backwards, converting F 0into a proton pump. In this case, \u03b3is driven\nby sequential hinge-bending motions of \u03b2\u2019s, like a crankshaft by the pistons in a car engine\n(for more details see Ref. [12]). In this paper, we focus on F 1-ATPase and consider its\noperation in both hydrolysis (as a motor) and synthesis (as a synth esizer) directions, using\nin parallel two simple mechanistic analogs: a plane rotator and a partic le subjected to a\nperiodic potential. Our description is consistent with Boyer\u2019s binding- change mechanism\n[13,14], the recent \ufb01ndings of Cherepanov et al.and Junge et al.[15] on elasticity properties\nof the\u03b3subunit, as well as with the experimental results of Yasuda et al.[16].\nThe structure of F 1-ATPase and the mechanics of motions within it are too complex to\nallow a detailed description of all interactions and motions of its di\ufb00ere nt parts, i.e., the\nthree\u03b2and one\u03b3subunits [10,12\u201314,17\u201319]. Therefore, it would be useful to describ e this\nvery sophisticated three-dimensional system, using simple mechan ical equivalents (springs,\nparticles, etc.) and keeping the main features of rotary dynamics f ound in previous studies,\nsuch as the modeling of Oster and Wang [12] and others [10,15\u201319]. Th is approach, \u201cfrom\ncomplexity to simplicity\u201d, is often used in biological physics. The typica l example of such\na modeling is the propagation of a nerve impulse on the giant axon of th e squid, where\ninsight in the dynamics of the original Hodgkin-Huxley equations [20] h as been obtained by\nreduction to the minimal FitzHugh-Nagumo system [21].\nHere the three-dimensional andfour-bodyinteraction inthe \u03b23\u03b3subcomplex is suggested\n2\ntobee\ufb00ectivelydescribedasacouplingofaplanarrotatoroflength R0centeredinthemiddle\nof an equilateral triangle (see left panels of Figs. 2 and 3) with three equivalent catalytic\nsites (denote them by numbers 1, 2, and 3) at the vertices of the t riangle. Obviously, this\nrotor-statorinteraction, resulting inacrankshaft-likerotation of\u03b3(andcooperativecatalysis\non\u03b2\u2019s), is a periodic function: U(\u03b8+2\u03c0) =U(\u03b8), where \u03b8denotes the angular position of\nthe rotator (positive if counter-clockwise). The mechanical equiv alent of a driving torque\non\u03b3can be chosen as a stretched spring or an e\ufb00ective particle displace d from equilibrium\nin the periodic potential U(\u03b8) as illustrated in the left and the right panels of Figs. 2 and\n3, respectively. At each site i= 1,2,3, a spring Kiis attached connecting this site with the\nrotator. All the three springs are supposed to be identical, but on ly one spring is allowed to\nbe switched on, while the other two are switched o\ufb00, at a time. Then s equential switching\nthe springs will result in a power stroke on \u03b3. Without loss of generality, the rotor-stator\npotential (given in units of the hydrolysis energy W\u224380 pN\u00b7nm) can be written as\nU(\u03b8) = [r(\u03b8)\u2212a]2/(l\u2212a)2, (1)\nwherea=d/R0is the length of each spring Kibeing undistorted, r(\u03b8) =\n/radicalBig\n1+(1+ a)2\u22122(1+a)cos\u03b8the instantaneous spring length, and l=r(\u00b12\u03c0/3).\nLet us now describe how our spring system operates in both the hyd rolysis and synthesis\ndirections and how it can be coordinated with ATP hydrolysis/synthe sis reactions at the\ncatalytic sites of the \u03b2subunits. According to Boyer\u2019s hypothesis [13] supported by the\nstructural studies by Walker and coworkers [14], and recently by d irect observation of Noji\net al. [18], each site 1, 2, or 3 can be found at least in one of the three sta tes: T (ATP\nbinding), E (empty), and D (ADP binding), at a time. Structurally, th ey are arranged as\nT, E, and D counter-clockwise (see Figs. 1-3) and can be put on the \u03b8axis at the lattice\n(\u201ccatalytic\u201d) sites with spacing 2 \u03c0/3, as shown in the right panels of Figs. 2 and 3. The\ndimensionless periodic (with period 2 \u03c0) potential U(\u03b8) [not necessary of the form (1)] is\nsupposed to be \u201crigidly tied\u201d to this lattice, so that its minima are alway s found at sites\nwith state T. We assume this potential to satisfy the normalization c onditions: U(T)= 0\n3\nandU(D)= 1. The last constarint means that the potential energy of th e e\ufb00ective particle\nin state D is equal to the free hydrolysis energy W.\nConsider \ufb01rst the hydrolysis direction when F 1operates as a motor (see Fig. 2). Let\ninitiallythe \u03b3subunit(rotor)befoundatequilibrium, performingtherethermal \ufb02uctuations.\nThis state is represented by spring K1being undistorted and switched on state T, while\nthe springs at the other sites ( K2andK3) are switched o\ufb00. In the particle equivalent, this\nsituation is represented in the right panel of Fig. 2(a) by a particle \ufb02 uctuating in the vicinity\nofoneoftheminimaofthepotential U(\u03b8), i.e., instateT.WhenanATPmoleculesettlesinto\nsite2whichisfoundatthistimeinstateE,itappearsboundthere, re sultinginATPbinding:\nE\u2192T. According to the rotary binding-change mechanism [13,14], this tr ansition implies\nthe two conformational changes at the next two sites: release of the inorganic phosphate\n(P) and the ADP (adenosinediphosphate) molecule from site 2 (D \u2192E), and hydrolysis of\nthe ATP molecule located at site 3 (T \u2192D). After these state transitions have occured,\nspringK1is switched o\ufb00, while spring K2is switched on, causing the power stroke on the\nrotor as demonstrated by Fig. 2(b). Therefore the rotor is drive n forward before it reaches\na new equilibrium state, stepping forward by 2 \u03c0/3. Correspondingly, as shown in the right\npanel, the potential U(\u03b8) steps forward (to the right) by 2 \u03c0/3, so that the particle appears\nto be lifted uphill at the level U= 1, thereafter sliding down and \ufb01nally dwelling in the\nnext potential minimum before the next sequence of conformation al changes takes place.\nHowever, if occasionally two sequential conformational transition s occur very close in time\nresulting in two almost simultaneous potential steps forward, the p article appears on the\npositive slope of the potential U(\u03b8), sliding thereafter down backwards. When the time\nbetween two sequential transitions is still short, but long enough f or the particle to make\na descent close to equilibrium, the double potential step forward will result in the double\nsliding down on the negative slope. Indeed, both such occasional st eps of\u03b3loaded by an\nactin \ufb01lament were observed in experiments [16,18,19]. We denote the sequence of time\ninstants when hydrolysis events occur by {t+\ni}\u221e\ni=1and call it a \u201chydrolysis sequence\u201d.\nConsider now the case, when an external torque (e.g., from the sid e of F 0) is applied to\n4\nthe\u03b3subunit clockwise, as shown in the left panel of Fig. 3(a). According to Cherepanov et\nal.and Junge et al.[15], the external energy of torsion is stored as an elastic strain en ergy of\n\u03b3. When the rotator turns clockwise totally by 2 \u03c0/3, the torsional energy is liberated for the\nsynthesis of one ATP molecule at the site being in state D. Then spring K1is switched o\ufb00,\nwhile spring K3ison, bringing thesystem tothezero-energy level ( U= 0). Equivalently, the\nparticle \u201cdrops down\u201d to equilibrium state T [see Fig. 3(b)]. These mec hanical equivalents\nare again in accordance with Boyer [13] for ATP synthesis, when the conformational change\nD\u2192T implies the transitions at the other two sites: T \u2192E and E \u2192D. We denote the\nsequence of time instants when synthesis events occur by {t\u2212\nj}\u221e\nj=1and call it a \u201csynthesis\nsequence\u201d.\nSummarizing, one can present the diagram shown in Fig. 4, which desc ribes the elastic\nstrain energy of the torsional rotor-stator interaction as a fun ction of\u03b8, combining both the\nhydrolysis and synthesis directions. Arrows show the rotational d irection under hydrolysis\n(\u03b8 >0,motorregime) and synthesis ( \u03b8 <0,synthesizer regime).\nIn experiments [16,18,19], the \u03b3subunit was loaded by an actin\ufb01lament rotating in a vis-\ncous solution. Therefore, we approach the overdamped limit and th e equation of motion for\nthe rotator driven by a periodic potential U(\u03b8) \ufb02uctuating stepwise forward and backwards\nby 2\u03c0/3 (due to hydrolysis power strokes and an external load torque Tl) reads\n\u0393\u02d9\u03b8=\u2212W\u2202\u03b8U[\u03b8\u22122\u03c0S(t)/3]\u2212Tl(\u03b8,t)+\u03be(t), (2)\nwhere \u0393 is a viscous friction coe\ufb03cient, U(\u03b8) is normalized by U(2\u03c0n) = 0 and U[2\u03c0(n\u00b1\n1/3)] = 1,n= 0,\u00b11,..., and\u03be(t) is the Brownian torque with the auto-correlation function\n/an}bracketle{t\u03be(t)\u03be(t\u2032)/an}bracketri}ht= 2\u0393kBT\u03b4(t\u2212t\u2032), where kBdenotes Boltzmann\u2019s constant and Tis the absolute\ntemperature. The stepping (driving) function\nS(t) =\u221e/summationdisplay\ni=1\u0398(t\u2212t+\ni)\u2212\u221e/summationdisplay\nj=1\u0398(t\u2212t\u2212\nj), (3)\nwhere \u0398( t) = 0 for t <0 and \u0398( t) = 1 for t\u22650, is de\ufb01ned through the two time sequences\n{t+\ni}\u221e\ni=1and{t\u2212\nj}\u221e\nj=1indicating the time instants when hydrolysis and synthesis reactions\noccur, respectively.\n5\nThe hydrolysis sequence {t+\ni}is a random process determined by ATP concentration\n([ATP]). We de\ufb01ne it through two characteristic duration times \u2206 tDand \u2206tTby the recur-\nrence relation\nt+\ni+1=t+\ni+\u2206tD+2\u03b6i+1\u2206tT, i= 1,2,..., (4)\nwhere each \u03b6i\u2208[0,1] is a random value with uniform distribution (since ATP concentratio n\nis supposed to be constant in the solution). The interval \u2206 tTis large for low [ATP], but\ntends to zero as [ATP] is su\ufb03ciently high. Therefore one can assume that \u2206tT=AT/[ATP]\nwith some constant AT>0. The interval \u2206 tDtriggers the hydrolysis reactions by release of\nP and ADP on the next site of the stator. In the limit of low concentra tion of nucleotides\n(ATP and ADP), this interval is short, whereas for high concentra tion, the release of the\nhydrolysis products is impeded and therefore some saturation for \u2206tDtakes place. As a\nresult, one can assume that \u2206 tD= \u2206tst[ATP]/(CD+ [ATP]) with some constant CD>0\nand \u2206tstbeing the duration time of one step. At zero temperature, it follows from the over-\ndamped dynamics governed by Eq. (2) that \u2206 tst\u2192 \u221e(an overdamped particle approaches\na potential minimum after an in\ufb01nitely long time). However, at nonzer o temperature, the\ntime for one step becomes \ufb01nite, because in the vicinity of equilibrium, the particle is \u201ccap-\ntured\u201d by thermal \ufb02uctuations. Thus, in the limit a\u21920, the potential (1) is reduced to\nthe simple form U= 2(1\u2212cos\u03b8)/3, admitting an explicit solution of Eq. (2) for each step\nif\u03be(t)\u22610. Since the average amplitude of thermal \ufb02uctuations is/radicalBig\n3D/2, one \ufb01nds that\n\u2206tst\u2243(3t0/2)ln/parenleftBig\u221a\n3cot/radicalBig\n3D/8/parenrightBig\n, wheret0= \u0393/Wis the time unit and D=kBT/Wthe\ndimensionless strength of white noise in Eq. (2). Since, at room temp eraturekBT\u22434\npN\u00b7nm, we thus have D \u22430.05, so that \u2206 tstcan be estimated for each viscous load \u0393.\nAveraging Eq. (4), one \ufb01nds that /an}bracketle{tt+\nj+1\u2212t+\nj/an}bracketri}ht= \u2206tD+\u2206tTand therefore the rotational\nrate of\u03b3(number of revolutions per second) is V= [3(\u2206tD+\u2206tT)]\u22121. Inserting here the\ndependences of \u2206 tD,Ton [ATP] given above, one \ufb01nds\nV=Vmax[ATP]\nKM+[ATP]2/(CD+[ATP]), (5)\n6\nwhereVmax= (3\u2206tst)\u22121= (\u2206tD)\u22121is a maximal average velocity (as [ATP] \u2192 \u221e) and\nthe constant KM=AT/\u2206tstcan be identi\ufb01ed as the Michaelis constant, because Eq. (5)\nis reduced to the Michaelis-Menten law in the limit CD\u21920. According to Yasuda et al.\n[16],KM= 0.8\u00b5M andVmax= 4 s\u22121, and for these values the dependence (5) is shown in\nFig. 5 (including the experimental data), with monotonic behavior fo rCD\u2264KM. Similarly\n[16], one can assume that the one-step duration depends on the len gth of the \ufb01lament Las\n\u2206tst\u2243g0+g1L3, and substituting this expression into Eq. (5), one \ufb01nds for small CDthe\ndependence V(L)\u22431\n3(AT/[ATP]+ g0+g1L3)\u22121plotted in Fig. 6, where the constants AT\nandg0,1are \ufb01tted to the experiments [16].\nAs described above, for a given random hydrolysis sequence (4), e ach synthesis instant\nt\u2212\njis de\ufb01ned as the time when the rotor, being at some time in state T, ro tates backwards\nby 2\u03c0/3. Direct simulations of the dimensionless ( \u03c4=t/t0) equation (2) with the potential\n(1) are presented in Fig. 7. Here the intervals \u2206 \u03c4D,T= \u2206tD,T/t0in the sequence (4) are given\nthrough the constants CDandKM, as well as the parameter \u2206 \u03c4st= \u2206tst/t0=W/3\u0393Vmaxto\nbe evaluated from experiments. Thus, using that \u0393( L= 1\u00b5m)\u22431 pN\u00b7nm\u00b7s andVmax= 4\ns\u22121[16], one \ufb01nds \u2206 \u03c4st\u22436.75.In the case without load (curves 1 and 2), the average\nvelocity/an}bracketle{t\u03b8/an}bracketri}ht/2\u03c0\u03c4= \u0393V/Wis in good agreement with the direct observations (see Fig. 3 of\nRef. [16]) and the law plotted in Fig. 5 at CD=KM, where the two velocities shown with\ndotted lines 1 and 2 correspond to curves 1 and 2 in Fig. 7, respectiv ely. Note that the\nconstant CDin Eq. (5) implicitly describes the main feature of trajectories at low [A TP] (see\ncurve 2): on average the number of multi-steps exceeds that of s teps backwards, as observed\nexperimentally [18,16]. Next, when a load torque Tl>0 is applied, the rotational rate\ndecreases with increase of this torque, as illustrated by curve 3 in F ig. 7. Moreover, when\nthe load exceeds some threshold value, the motor operates in inver se, as shown by curves 4\nand 5. Similarly to Lattanzi and Maritan [8], the law (5) can be modi\ufb01ed b y subtracting a\npositive constant that controls the direction of rotation if Tl>0.\nThus, we have developed two (rotator and one-particle) physical models of archetypal\n7\nsimplicity, which are consistent with the rotary binding-change mech anism [13,14] and the\nelasticity properties of the \u03b3subunit [15]. The cooperative rotational catalysis at the three\n\u03b2subunits is described through two time sequences, each for switch ing hydrolysis and syn-\nthesis reactions, by adjusting the statistics of switching to satisf y the recent experimental\nresults [18,16]. The models described in this paper are generic and simp le; they do not\ndepend on details of the periodic potential U(\u03b8). In the hydrolysis (motor) direction, the \u03b3\nsubunit works in a \u201cpassive\u201d regime; only all the \u03b2subunits are coordinated in the cooper-\native rotational catalysis. In the reversible (synthesis) direction ,\u03b3is \u201cactive\u201d, causing the\ncorresponding (again cooperative, but in the inverse sequence) c onformational changes after\nits strain energy of torsion reaches the free ATP hydrolysis energ y. These important fea-\ntures are consistent with both Boyer\u2019s binding-change mechanism [1 3,14] and the \ufb01ndings of\nCherepanov et al.and Junge et al.[15]. The dependences of the model parameters on ATP\nconcentration are general and physically motivated. In the frame work of our description,\nthe load torque Tl(\u03b8,t) generated by the F 0part can further be involved explicitly resulting\nin a general motor/pump model of ATP synthase.\nWe also conclude that the puzzle, how does the binding-change mech anism work, may\nbe essential not only for understanding the chemistry (dissipative catalysis) of creation of\nATP, one of the most important processes in life, but also constitut e a key physical problem\nbehind the function of molecular motors, such as design of man-mad e molecular devices.\nWe acknowledge partial \ufb01nancial support from the European Union under the IN-\nTAS Grant No. 97-0368 and the LOCNET Project No. HPRN-CT-199 9-00163.

The model is based on the postu-\nlates of a minimum reproduction age and a maximal genetic lif espan. It allows\nfor self-organization of a typical age of \ufb01rst reproduction and a typical age of\ndeath. Our Monte Carlo simulations of the population dynami cs show that\nthe model leads to catastrophic senescence for semelparous reproduction as it\noccurs in the case of salmon, but to a more gradually increase of senescence\nfor iteroparous reproduction.\nKeywords : population dynamics, aging, Stau\ufb00er model, Monte Carlo\n1 Introduction\nAccording to the evolutionary theory of aging senescence is ultimately caused by a\ndeclining pressure of natural selection as one gets older an d older [1]. One mani-\nfestation of senescence (which can be most easily handled on the computer) is an\nincrease of mortality with age or, more precisely, a decreas e of survivors at age a,\nfrom an initial population of newly born o\ufb00spring at time 0. S enescence is attributed\nto several factors like environment, metabolism, and, most important, by several ge-\nnetic mechanisms. Two major genetic mechanisms, which are u nder discussion and\nneed not necessarily exclude each other, are antagonistic p leitropy and mutation-\naccumulation. Based on the latter mechanism, i.e. on the hyp othesis of an increase\nof deleterious mutations with age, Penna et al. (1995) propo sed a bit-string model\n[2] , which nowadays is widely used for Monte Carlo simulatio ns of aging, because\nit predicts many experimentally observed features of senes cence (for a recent review\n1\nsee [3]). One of the successful predicitions is the catastro phic senescence for the\nPaci\ufb01c salmon.\nPaci\ufb01c salmon show the most dramatic manifestation of aging . As semelparous\nindividuals they breed only once in their life, all at the sam e age, with plenty of\no\ufb00spring, and die a few weeks later . In contrast to salmon, it eroparous individuals\nbreed repeatedly and age more gradually.\n2 The model\nRecently Stau\ufb00er has proposed a model which is based on the po stulate of a mini-\nmum reproduction age and a maximal genetic lifespan [4]. Onl y these two numbers\nare transmitted from generation to generation, with certai n mutations, by asexual\nreproduction. The population consists of Nindividuals i(i\u22081, ..., N ) initially. Each\nindividual is characterized by three integers: its age a(i), its minimum reproduction\nageam(i) and its maximal genetic lifespan ad(i) with 0 \u2264am(i)< ad(i)\u226432. The\nmaximal lifetime is restricted to 32 time units (called year s), the minimum repro-\nduction age may be chosen between zero and ad(i)\u22121. Within these constraints the\nvalues of am(i) and ad(i) are randomly mutated for an o\ufb00spring by \u00b11, away from\nthe maternal values, and for each child separately. These mu tations realize some\nkind of antagonistic pleiotropy in the sense that a shorter l ifespan or a later repro-\nduction age increase the birth rate. (\u201cParents die to make pl ace for their children\u201d.)\nAfter an individual has reached its minimum reproduction ag e, it gives birth to one\no\ufb00spring with probability b, chosen as (1 + \u01eb)/(ad(i)\u2212am(i) +\u01eb) with \u01eb= 0.08\nfor convenience. Independently of the genetic death, which happens automatically\nand unavoidably if a(i) =ad(i), at each time interval an individual can also die\n\u201caccidentally\u201d, with the Verhulst probalility N/N max.Nmaxis called the carrying\ncapacity to account for the fact that any given environment c an only support pop-\nulations up to some maximal size Nmax. Otherwise the individuals die because of\nfood and space limitations. Stau\ufb00er\u2019s model shows the basic features required for\nsenescence. The age distribution shows an increase of morta lity with age. Moreover,\na self-organization of a typical age of \ufb01rst reproduction an d of death is observed,\nsimilarly to Ito\u2019s self-organization of a minimum reproduc tion age in the framework\nof the Penna model [5].\nIn this paper we apply Stau\ufb00er\u2019s model to the population dyna mics of Paci\ufb01c\nsalmon and check whether the model is able to reproduce the qu alitative features of\ncatastrophic senescence. For a given value of Nmaxand an initial population of N\nindividuals we specify am(i) = 1 and ad(i) = 16 for all i= 1, ..., N as initial values.\nOne Monte Carlo iteration then consists of the following thr ee steps that we call\n\u201cdeaths\u201d, \u201cbirths\u201d and \u201caging\u201d.\n\u2022In the \ufb01rst loop of \u201cdeaths\u201d over all individuals, each indiv idual dies either with\nthe Verhulst probability N/N max, or, if it survives space and food limitations,\n2\nbecause it has reached its maximal genetically allowed age ad(i). Otherwise it\nsurvives. The initial population of size Ngets reduced this way.\n\u2022In the second loop of \u201cbirths\u201d over all individuals, each ind ividual gives birth\ntonb\u22651 o\ufb00spring with probability b= 1.08/(ad(i)\u2212am(i) + 0.08), provided\nthe maternal age is not below the minimum reproduction age an d equals a\n\ufb01xed given integer a0with 0 \u2264am(i)\u2264a0< a d(i)\u226432 and a0(i) =a0is\nchosen the same for all individuals. The latter condition ob viously accounts\nfor the speci\ufb01c features of salmon which breed only once and a ll at the same\nage. It turns out that the choice of the number of o\ufb00spring nbis not arbitrary,\nbecause the second condition is so restrictive that the popu lation only survives\nfor su\ufb03ciently large nb. Now the values of amandadfor the o\ufb00spring are\nmutated away from the maternal values, again at each time int erval by \u00b11\nfor each child separately as in Stau\ufb00er\u2019s model, but with pro bability ps<1.\nThis way the mutations become suppressed with probability 1 \u2212ps, to account\nfor the experimental fact that the time interval for reprodu ction of salmon is\nrather narrow for anygeneration. Unless mutations are suppressed, they have\nthe tendency of spreading the \ufb01rst reproduction age within a broader time\ninterval. On the histograms of aging this has a similar e\ufb00ect as iteroparous\nreproduction. The question is whether the minimum reproduc tion age adjusts\nitself to a value which is self-consistent with the prescrib ed \ufb01xed reproduction\nagea0. The remaining mutations should drive the initial values fo ram(i)\ntowards a0.\n\u2022In the third step of a single iteration, the population which remains from the\n\ufb01rst two steps ages by one time unit, ( a(i)\u2192a(i) + 1). The population size\nand averages over the individual minimum reproduction ages and the maximal\nlifespans are stored. From a certain number of iterations on also the individual\nagesa(i),am(i) and ad(i) are stored in histograms as a function of the time\ninterval j,j\u2208(1, ...,32).\nNow the iterations are repeated a number of ttimes until the population dy-\nnamics has stabilized and the \ufb02uctuations in average values are negligibly small.\n3 Results\nFigs.1 and 2 show various histograms of ages adfor genetic death which were ob-\ntained for the following choice of parameters. In Fig.1 the c arrying capacity Nmax\nis chosen as 2 \u00b7105,Ninitially as Nmax/2. The number of iterations tis 2\u00b7104.\nThe actual reproduction age a0is \ufb01xed to 6, and the number of births nbwhich an\nindividual can give to o\ufb00spring at the age of 6 is 12. Mutation s of the minimum\nreproduction age of o\ufb00spring are suppressed by 80%(+), 95%( x) and 99%( \u22c6), re-\nspectively. The histograms show a clear self-organized max imum of genetic death\nat an age of 7. In discrete time units this means that death occ urs most likely\n3\ndirectly after reproduction. The peaks are the sharper the s tronger the suppres-\nsion of mutations. The qualitative shape of the histograms s tays the same when\nNmaxis varied over several orders of magnitude. Already after \u2248100 iterations\nthe population dynamics stabilizes in the sense that the pop ulation size oscillates\nregularly between stable minimum and maximum values. These regular oscillations\nbuild up randomly during the \ufb01rst 100 iterations and then are reproduced with the\nperiod a0= 6. The value of nb= 12 is the minimal integer so that the population\nwith 95% suppression of mutations survives as a whole. For sm allernbit dies out\nafter a few iterations. This feature is in qualitative agree ment with nature. Paci\ufb01c\nsalmon produce plenty o\ufb00spring once they breed to compensat e for the restrictive\nconditions on amanda0independent of i. The maximum of the histogram of ages\nfor the minimal reproduction age lies at an age of 6, consiste nt with the prescribed\nvalue a0.\nIn Fig.2 we compare histograms of ages for genetic death betw een iteroparous\n(full line) and semelparous (dashed line) reproduction. Th e dashed curve was ob-\ntained for Nmax= 2\u00b7105,t= 2\u00b7104,a0= 6,nb= 12, 1 \u2212ps= 99%. Again it\nshows a sharp peak at the age of 7. The histogram for iteroparo us reproduction was\nobtained for Nmax= 2\u00b7107,t= 2\u00b7104, reproduction can happen at any age between\nam(i) and ad(i), (i.e. i-dependent and possibly several times in one life) ,nb= 1\nand no suppression of mutations of am(i) and ad(i) for the o\ufb00spring. The hundred\ntimes larger value for Nmaxwas chosen for convenience to get comparable numbers\nforadin spite of the di\ufb00erent reproduction conditions. The maxim a of both curves\nare self-organized, but in the iteroparous case the maximum is much broader, going\nalong with a gradual increase of senescence with time or a les s rapid aging than in\nthe case of salmon, compatible with the Penna model [2].\n4 Summary\nStau\ufb00er\u2019s model based on the two postulates of a minimum repr oduction age and a\nmaximal genetic lifespan predicts the catastrophic senesc ence for the Paci\ufb01c salmon\nin a qualitative way. The larger the suppression of mutation s, the faster die the\nindividuals after reproduction, and the larger is the numbe r of births in one repro-\nduction step which is necessary to sustain the species. The s elf-organized maximum\nof the histogram of ages amis self-consistent with the only allowed age a0for repro-\nduction, a restriction that is used as an input. Stau\ufb00er\u2019s ex planation works without\nmutation-accumulation, whereas mutation-accumulation w as an essential ingredient\nin the Penna model. Therefore, di\ufb00erently from what the succ ess of the Penna\nmodel might have suggested, mutation-accumulation does no t seem to be essential\nfor explaining gross qualitative features of senescence.\n4\n5 Acknowlegdment\nI would like to thank Dietrich Stau\ufb00er for stimulating discu ssions.\nReferences\n[1] M.

Un-\nderstanding the detailed mechanisms of the folding of membr ane proteins is a\nlargely unsolved, key problem in structural biology. Here, we introduce a gen-\neral model and use computer simulations to study the equilib rium properties\nand the folding kinetics of a C\u03b1-based two helix bundle fragment (comprised\nof 66 amino-acids) of Bacteriorhodopsin. Various intermed iates are identi\ufb01ed\nand their free energy are calculated toghether with the free energy barrier\nbetween them. In 40% of folding trajectories, the folding ra te is considerably\nincreased by the presence of non-obligatory intermediates acting as traps. In\nall cases, a substantial portion of the helices is rapidly fo rmed. This initial\nstage is followed by a long period of consolidation of the hel ices accompa-\nnied by their correct packing within the membrane. Our resul ts provide the\n1\nframework for understanding the variety of folding pathway s of helical trans-\nmembrane proteins.\n2\nConsiderable e\ufb00ort has been expended to understand the dynamic s of the folding and\nbiological functionality of proteins. Whereas the behavior of small w ater soluble globular\nproteins is reasonably well understood both experimentally and the oretically2,3, much less\nis known about membrane proteins (MP)4\u20137that cross biological membranes. Transmem-\nbrane proteins (TMP) are the most important and best studied clas s of MP4,5,8. They are\ncharacterized by the presence in their primary structure of long s egments (20 \u221230) of amino\nacids with a high degree of hydrophobicity. In the native structure , these correspond to the\ntransmembrane segments which are inserted in the lipidic interior of t he membrane9. These\nsegments are predominantly made up of \u03b1-helices and \u03b2-sheets. The stability of \u03b1-helices\nand\u03b2-sheets inside the membrane follow from the formation of hydrogen bonds between the\nbackbone atoms \u2013 other possibilities are excluded within the apolar en viroment4,10.\nPhenomenological models have proved to be powerful for interpre ting experimental data.\nThe most common of these is the Two-Stage model based on experimental evidence that\nthe folding of TMP occurs in two stages. In the \ufb01rst stage, \u03b1-helices and \u03b2-sheets are\nformed with the full native state structure being formed in a distinc t second stage10. A\nmore re\ufb01ned model4takes into account four main steps: partitioning, folding, insertion and\nassociation. Recently, Pappu et al.11have used a potential smoothing algorithm to predict\ntransmembrane helix packing in good accord with experimental data .\nMilik and Skolnick12,13have carried out careful Monte Carlo studies of the insertion\nof peptide chains into lipid membranes and have proposed a new hydro pathy scale based\non experimental data obtained by studying the interactions of trip eptides with phospho-\nlipid membranes14and the self-solvation e\ufb00ect in protein systems15. Recently Wimley and\nWhite16havedesignedtransmembranepeptidesthatspontaneouslyinser tacrossbilayersbut\nyet have measurable monomeric water stability, opening the way for the determination of\nthe thermodynamic cost of partitioning hydrogen bonded peptide b onds into the membrane\nhydrocarbon core.\nThe Monte-Carlo results ofMilikandSkolnick12,13areingoodaccordwithEngelmanand\nSteitz\u2019shelicalhairpinhypothesis17furtherextendedbyJacobsandWhite18,19. Theunfolded\n3\nchain is \ufb01rst adsorbed onto the membrane interface, driven mostly by the hydrophobic\ne\ufb00ect and electrostatic lipid-protein interactions20\u201322. A polypeptide chain has a greater\npossibility, while anchored to the interface, of saturating its intern al hydrogen bonds and\nforming helices. Such helical fragments have a greater propensity to subsequently di\ufb00use\ninto the lipid phase.\nAdetailedstudyofTMPhasnotyetbeenpossiblebecauselittleisknow nabouttheinter-\nactions between amino acids inside the membrane or between them an d the lipid molecules.\nHere, we adopt a simple, yet powerful, strategy for attacking the folding properties of TMP\nthat circumvents this shortcoming. Our novel approach is based o n extensive studies of\nthe folding of globular proteins which have underscored the importa nt role played by the\ntopology of the native state in controlling both the functionality and the main features of\nthe folding process. Nature uses a rich repertory of twenty kinds of amino acids with some-\ntimes major and at other times subtle di\ufb00erences in their interaction s with the solvent and\nwith each other in order to design sequences that \ufb01t the putative n ative state with minimal\nfrustration32. Thus a fruitful and general strategy for the study of protein f olding would be\nto extract information on the folding process directly from the top ology of the native state.\nOur study here focuses on the folding process by using a tractable approach (described\nin the Methods Section) that by-passes the details of the complex in teractions of the protein\nin the lipid enviroment by introducing e\ufb00ective potentials, induced by t he presence of the\nmembrane and the associated interface region, that stabilize the n ative state structure. The\nvalidity of the approach based on the native state topology, in the c ase of globular pro-\nteins, has been con\ufb01rmed a posteriori from the agreement betwe en theory and experimental\n\ufb01ndings2,23\u201331. The approach proposed here is similar in spirit and ought to be a tool and a\nguide for the di\ufb03cult experimental situation of TMP16. Our model allows a complete char-\nacterization of the thermodynamics and the dynamics of the full fo lding process. Due to the\nsmall number of degrees of freedom involved, the dynamics of the s ystem can be simulated\nfor the full folding process. Moreover, the free energies of the m ost relevant intermediate\nstates and free energy pro\ufb01les along the reaction paths connect ing them can be explicitly\n4\ncalculated by thermodynamic integration (see Methods). Thus the model is able to quanti-\ntatively discriminate between the possible reaction paths envisaged for the insertion process\nof TMP across the membrane4, a feature that is not an obvious consequence of the structure\nof the model. Where there is overlap, our model captures the qualit ative features of the\nearlier simulations of Milik and Skolnick12,13.\nThe TMP we considered is made up of the \ufb01rst 66 amino acids of bacter iorhodopsin\nconsisting of two \u03b1-helices (Fig. 1 a). It has been shown that the \ufb01rst two helices of bacteri-\norhodopsin can be considered as independent folding domains33. Furthermore, the side-by-\nside interactions between transmembrane helices play a key role in th e stabilization of the\nprotein structure34.\nOurstudieswerecarriedoutusingaMonteCarloalgorithmthathasb eenproventobeex-\ntremely e\ufb03cient for interacting hetero-polymers (Methods). The behaviour of the structural\nsimilarity between the system equilibrated at temperature T(measured in dimensionless\nunits) and the native state is shown in Figure 1 bin terms of the average fraction of native\nstate contacts as a function of Tand partitioned depending on their positions with respect\nto the membrane. The three curves correspond respectively to t he average fraction of native\ncontacts inside ( qm) , outside ( qb) and across ( qs) the membrane (see Methods). All these\ncurves, well separated at high T, collapse for Tbelow the transition temperature TC\u223c0.6,\nindicating a cooperative e\ufb00ect in the folding. On monitoring the free e nergy as a function\nof the energy around TC, one observes additional local minima (besides those correspondin g\nto the unfolded and folded states) suggesting the presence of an intermediate.\nThe intermediate is characterized by having the two helices almost co mpletely formed\nbut not yet correctly inserted across the membrane. A metastab le state in which the protein\nexists at the membrane interface ought to be expected on genera l grounds. Indeed a generic\nheteropolymer withhydrophobic andhydrophilic aminoacids, ofwhich aTMPisaparticular\ncase, has a favorable conformation which is localized near surfaces between two selective\nmedia (the outside and the inside part of the membrane in the presen t case)35,36. At not too\nhigh temperatures, the gain in energy to place hydrophobic/hydro philic protein segments in\n5\ntheir preferred enviroment compensates the entropy loss for be ing localized at the interface\nwith respect to remain in the bulk phase. Thus, even though our mod el does not explicitly\ncontain information on the character of the amino acids, it is able to p redict this feature.\nThe presence of these extra minima suggests that non-constitut ive membrane proteins\nwouldfoldwithmulti-statekineticscorrespondingtoon-pathwayint ermediates. Toestablish\ntheir nature of and their in\ufb02uence on the dominant folding pathways , we have performed\na detailed analysis of the folding kinetics. Each independent kinetic fo lding simulation was\nstarted with the equilibrated denaturated state at T\u2217= 2.5 . The protein is placed initially\noutside the membrane in the interface region4, at a distance comparable to the average\nsize of the denatured protein and then suddenly quenched to a tem perature ( T= 0.4) well\nbelowthetransitiontemperature. Thiscasesimulatesthefoldingkin eticsofnon-constitutive\nmembrane proteins, i.e. proteins that do not need a translocon pro viding a \u2019tunnel\u2019 through\nwhich the protein is injected into the lipid bilayer. Folding to the native s tate occurs mainly\nthrough the states depicted in Figure 2 awith the dominant pathways shown in Figure 2 b.\nIn all the pathways, thesystem goes fromtheunfolded state, Uto stateHIin which 80%\nof the secondary structure is formed (see qin Figure 3 c) and disposed horizontally along the\ninterface. The free energy of this state (measured with respect to the free energy of the fully\nfolded state) is \u223c2.4 TC. This state corresponds to the formation of around 70 % of the\nmembrane contacts. The average time \u03c4HIto reach state HIis of the order of 500 Monte\nCarlo steps (see Figures 3 and 4; each Monte-Carlo step correspo nds to 50000 attempted\nlocal deformations.). State HI turns out to be an obligatory on-pa thway intermediate of the\nfolding kinetics for non-constitutive MP in agreement with the gener al argument mentioned\nabove. Once the protein reaches state HI, it undergoes a relatively slow process of self-\narrangement in order to insert and assemble the secondary struc tures across the membrane.\nThisprocessistherate-limitingstepofthefoldingprocess, sinceitin volvesthetranslocation,\nthroughthelipidiclayer, ofasubstantialnumberofhydrophilicresid ues. Amongthepossible\npathways, starting from HI, the most frequent (60% of the cases) and the fastest turn out\nto beU\u2192HI\u2192HV\u2192N. A quantitative characterization of this dominant pathway\n6\nis presented in Figures 3 (for a single folding process) and 4 (as an av erage over 40 folding\nprocesses). The intermediate HVis characterized by having one \u03b1helix inserted across the\nmembrane and is reached in an average period corresponding to a sig ni\ufb01cant fraction of the\ntotal folding time (see Figure 3). The free energy in this state is \u223c0.98TC.The free energy\nbarrier between HIandHVis at\u223c4.31TC(hence, the rate constant of the transition\nHI\u2192HVis proportional to kHI\u2192HV= exp(\u2212(4.31\u22122.4)TC/T)). The full free energy\npro\ufb01le versus a reaction coordinate is shown in Fig. 5. The last part o f the folding process\ncorresponds to the insertion of the second helix and the assembly o f the two secondary\nstructures into the native state structure. This process lasts a pproximately one third of the\nfolding time along the pathway U\u2192HI\u2192HV\u2192N. The quasistatic free energy barrier\nbetweenHVand the folded state is \u223c1.66TC. The rate costant of the transition HV\u2192N\nis, therefore, proportional to exp( \u2212(1.66\u22120.98)TC/T). These results are consistent with\nthe time scales observed in the unconstrained folding dynamics. At t he end, the protein\nis completely packed, ( qmsaturates to 1 (Figures 3 aand 4a)) and the helices are correctly\npositioned across the membrane (note the second jump in the zcoordinate of the center of\nmass in Figures 3 band 4b).\nMuch slower dynamics can occur when non-obligatory intermediates are visited by the\nsystem. These long lived states ( {I}in Figure 2 a) involve a distribution of misfolded regions\nthat trap the system and are characterized by having most of the inter-helical contacts\nformed (assembly of the secondary structures) but with the two \u03b1-helices still incorrectly\npositioned. Note, for example, that in states {I}, only transmembrane contacts and some\ncontacts outside the membrane are misplaced and they account fo r only a small fraction\nof the native state energy. For this reason, in the states {I}, the free energy is \u223c1.44\nTC, only slightly higher than the free energy of HV. The folding can proceed from {I}\neither by disentangling the two helices and passing through the obliga tory intermediate\nHV, or by the simultaneous translocation through the membrane of th e two helices. These\nprocesses, however, entail the crossing of a big free energy bar rier (\u223c5.18TCfor the \ufb01rst\nprocess and 6 .1 for the second) and happen with low probability. Indeed, at su\ufb03cie ntly\n7\nlow temperatures, the loss in energy of the interhelical contacts is not compensated by the\ngain in the con\ufb01gurational entropy due to the uncoupling of the \u03b1\u2212helices. Thus below the\nfolding temperature, I-states act as trapping regions for the sy stem and when trapped, the\nprotein spends most of the time during folding in this state.\nIn summary, we have presented detailed calculations of helical tran smembrane proteins\nleading to a vivid picture of the folding process. Our strategy relies o n the dominant role\nplayed by the topology of the native state structure and by the e\ufb00 ective geometry imposed\nby the membrane and provides a picture which would be expected to b e quite accurate for\nwell-designed sequences that are a good \ufb01t to the target native st ate conformation. It is\ninteresting to note that , with our choice of the parameters, the p athway in which the helices\nassemble outside the membrane and are inserted later is unlikely to oc cur.\nModels based on the topology of the native state structure have b een remarkably\nsuccessful25\u201328in correctly describing the main features of the folding process det ermined\nin experiments2,23,24,29\u201331for various globular proteins. A similar approach has been gen-\neralized here to the almost virgin \ufb01eld of transmembrane proteins wh ere experiments are\nrather di\ufb03cult16,4,7. Our \ufb01ndings do not depend on the precise values of the \u01ebparameters\nintroduced in the model underscoring the robustness of the resu lts. Our approach predicts a\nfolding process involving multiple pathways with a dominant folding chan nel. The simpliciy\nof our model allows for a quantitative description of all the pathway s since we can monitor\nthe correct/uncorrect formation of native contacts andcompu te free energy pro\ufb01les. Further\ndetails not captured by the present approach arising from amino-a cid speci\ufb01c interactions\namong themselves, with the solvent and in particular with the interior of the membrane\nmay of course change the quantitative nature of the results. How ever, our model, which\ncaptures the bare essentials of a membrane protein, ought to pro vide a zeroth order picture\nof the folding process. Also, as experimental data becomes availab le, the results could be\nbenchmarked with models of this type to glean the other factors th at matter.\n8\nI. METHODS\nWe represent the residues of the membrane protein as single beads centered in their\nC\u03b1positions. Adjacent beads are tethered together into a polymer c hain by a harmonic\npotential with the average C\u03b1\u2212C\u03b1distance along the chain equal to 3 .8\u02daA. The membrane\nis described simply by a slab of width w=zmax\u2212zmin= 26\u02daA. Two non-bonded residues\n(i,j) form a contact if their distance is less then 6 .5\u02daA. In the study of globular proteins,\nthe topology of the native state is encoded in the contact map giving the pairs ( i,j) of\nnon-bonded residues that are in contact. Here, in addition, the loc ations of such pairs\nwith respect to the membrane becomes crucial. The contacts are d ivided into three classes:\nmembrane contacts where both iandjresidues are inside the membrane, interface contacts\nwithiandjin the interface region4outside the membrane and surface contacts with one\nresidue inside the membrane and the other outside. Thus a given pro tein conformation can\nhave anative contact but improperlyplaced withrespect tothemem brane (misplaced native\ncontact). The crucial interaction potential between non-bonded residue s (i,j) is taken to be\na modi\ufb01ed Lennard-Jones 12-10 potential:\n\u0393(i,j)\uf8ee\n\uf8f05/parenleftBiggdij\nrij/parenrightBigg12\n\u22126/parenleftBiggdij\nrij/parenrightBigg10\uf8f9\n\uf8fb+5 \u03931(i,j)/parenleftBiggdij\nrij/parenrightBigg12\n. (1)\nThe matrices \u0393( i,j) and \u0393 1(i,j) encode the topology of the TMP in the following way: if\n(i,j) is not a contact in the native state \u0393( i,j) = 0,\u03931(i,j) = 1; if ( i,j) is a contact in the\nnativestatebutnotattheproperlocation(i.e. amisplacedcontact )\u0393(i,j) =\u01eb1,\u03931(i,j) = 0;\nif (i,j) is a native state contact in the proper region \u0393( i,j) =\u01eb,\u03931(i,j) = 0. This model\nis intended to describe the folding process in the interface and in the membrane region.\nOur interaction potential (similar in spirit to a well known model37for globular proteins\n(see also other approaches that model helix formation38,39)) assigns two values to the energy\nassociated with the formation of a native contact, \u01eband\u01eb1.\nThe model captures the tendency to form native contacts. In ad dition, in order to\naccount for the e\ufb00ective interactions between the membrane and the protein, the model\n9\nassigns a lower energy, \u2212\u01eb, to the contact which occurs in the same region as in the native\nstate structure compared to \u2212\u01eb1when the contact is formed but in the wrong region of\nspace. This feature proves to be crucial in determining the mechan ism of insertion of the\nprotein across the membrane in order to place all native contacts in the same regions as in\nthe native state. Even though the interaction potential is simple an d intuitively appealing,\nit is not possible to simply guess (without detailed calculations) the fold ing mechanism and\nquantitatively determine the probability of occurrence of the vario us folding pathways4.\nWhen\u01eb=\u01eb1, the protein does not recognize the presence of the interface-m embrane\nregion and the full rotational symmetry is restored (the system b ehaves like a globular\nprotein). The di\ufb00erence in the parameters ( \u01eb\u2212\u01eb1) controls the amount of tertiary structure\nformationoutside the membrane. When the di\ufb00erence is small, the pr otein assembles almost\ncompletely outside the membrane and the insertion process would be di\ufb00usion limited. Our\nresults are independent of the precise values of the energy param eters\u01eband\u01eb1(\u01eb > \u01eb1) as\nlong as they are not too close to each other.\nWe report here the results of simulations with \u01eb1= 0.1 and\u01eb= 1.rijanddijare\nthe distance between the two residues ( i,j) and their distance in the native con\ufb01guration,\nrespectively. In order to account for the chirality of the TMP, a po tential for the pseudodi-\nhedral angle \u03b1ibetween the C\u03b1atoms in a helix corresponding to four successive locations\nis added which biases the helices to be in their native state structure .\nThe thermodynamics and the kinetics of the model were studied by a Monte Carlo\nmethod for polymer chains allowing for local deformations. The e\ufb03cie ncy of the program\n(usually low for continuum calculations) has been increased by full us e of the link cell\ntechnique40and by the multiple Markov chain method, a new sampling scheme, which has\nbeen proven to be particulary e\ufb03cient in exploring the low temperatu re phase diagram for\npolymers41. In our simulation 20 di\ufb00erent temperatures ranging from T= 2 toT= 0.17\nhave been studied. The free energy is calculated by reweighting the di\ufb00erent temperatures\nwith the Ferrenberg-Swendsen42algorithm.\nThe free energy di\ufb00erence FB\u2212FAbetween two states A and B has been estimated as\n10\nthe reversible work that has to be done in order to go from A to B.

This value is in accord\nwith the temperature of the heat capacity maxima.\nFigure 2: Schematic representation of states encountered by non-const itutive proteins\nduring the folding process.\nIna)the red cylinders denote \u03b1-helices that reside within the membrane in the native\nstate. The region inside the membrane is in turquoise whereas the re st represents the\ninterface region4in which the folding process starts. State Udenotes the denatured state\nof the protein, HOis a state in which the helices have been formed but are not yet inside\nthe membrane whereas HIcorresponds to a similar state but with the helices completely\nembedded in the membrane without any inter-helical contacts. Usu ally the helices form and\nenter into the membrane separately. HVdenotes an obligatory intermediate and Ndepicts\nthe native state. The state {I}represents an ensemble of long lived conformations in which\nhelices are formed inside the membrane with several inter-helical co ntacts, but with the two\n\u03b1-helices still incorrectly positioned. This conformations di\ufb00er in term of packing e\ufb03ciency\nof the helices. The state {I}is not obligatory for the folding kinetics. In b)the schematic\npathways to the native state are shown. In the most directed pat h, the entropy decreases\non going from UtoN. FromHItoHVthe entropy loss of one helix is not compensated by\na corresponding energy gain until both helices become vertical. This is the principal origin\n15\nof the high free energy barrier between the state HIand the native state.\nFigure 3: Typical time dependence of di\ufb00erent parameters as a function of t he Monte-\nCarlo steps for the pathway U\u2192HI\u2192HV\u2192N.

The HV\u2192Ntransition is reached by a progressive zippering\nof the horizontal and vertical helices.

Althoug h this phase separation feature\nis well understood, biologists can neither accurately pred ict the folded protein shape\nfor a given primary sequence, nor which sequences will fold a nd be stable, rather than\naggregate.\nIn this paper we present a method to study the folding propert ies of a model of\nproteins containing only two kinds of amino acids; hydropho bic and hydrophilic. This\nmodel is referred to as the AB-model. The idea is to try to \ufb01nd t he distribution of disorder\nfor copolymer sequences that give rise to a compact globule e xpressed as hydrophobic\ncore and hydrophilic exterior.\nThe study rests on two complementary methods, the painting m ethod and arti\ufb01cial\nneural networks (ANN) method. The painting method is applie d to quite short sequences\nand the ANN method to long sequences. The \ufb01rst is necessary to train the ANN. In other\nwords the ANN needs the training process (which can be done by the painting method)\nto study longer sequences which cannot be characterized by t he painting method. At\n\ufb01rst we only consider short sequences to prove the validity o f the painting method and\nthe applicability of windowing technique of ANN to the probl em of polymer collapse.\nThe paper is organized as follows: The next section describe s the model to study\nthe goodness of a sequence for the purposes of folding. The de scription of the method of\nsimulations used to collapse a homopolymer is given in secti on 3. The painting method\napplied to a collapsed homopolymer globule is presented is s ection 4. Section 5 describes\na study of the distribution of disorder in sequences of a gene ric model of protein expressed\nin terms of hydrophobic and hydrophilic units. This is done b y calculating the correlation\nfunction of monomers along the chain. The choice of using the ANN method is also\ndiscussed in the same section. We conclude in section 6.\n2. \u2013 The Model\nThe model presented here rests mainly on the principle that w hen a protein folds it\nturns into a globule, so that predominantly the hydrophobic units constitute the core of\nthe globule and the hydrophilic units the surface. We theref ore wish to create an ensemble\nof condensed chains all of which possess a hydrophobic core a nd hydrophilic exterior with\n\ufb01xed sizes. Each chain sequence of this ensemble is then know n to possess at least one\nacceptable folded state. To produce the painting structure of hydrophobic-hydrophilic\nmonomers we proceed in the following manner:\n1. Consider an open sequence of a homopolymer of a \ufb01xed size,\n2. We perform numerical simulations based on the method desc ribed in the following\nsection to bring the system to its folded state.\n3. The globule shape depends on the position of each monomer i n the sequence and\nthe interactions between them. This globule is not always co mpact. Testing the\ncompactness of the globule becomes necessary as only the sph erical globules are\nconsidered.\n4. The core of the globule is painted. The volume of the colore d core is de\ufb01ned by\nthe hydrophobicity ratio along the chain. The painting tech nique is described in\nsection 4.\n5. We can now ask if all the sequences, each of which has, a good folded state, can\nbe refolded from an open conformation to that state.

The Monte Carlo simulation method is again used for cop olymer sequences\nto discriminate the good sequences from the bad ones. A seque nce is considered to\nbe good if it refolds e\ufb03ciently and bad otherwise. The colore d sequences are also\nused to train the ANN.\nThe primary concern in this paper is to identify any implied h ydrophilic-hydrophobic\ncorrelations created by having a hydrophobic core structur e. Thus, we study the distri-\nbution of the AB-model. A sequence of monomers of length N can be described by\nthe binary variables \u03bb1,\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, \u03bbN. Without loss of generality we consider \u03bbi= +1 for hy-\ndrophilic and \u22121 for hydrophobic. \u039b is a random variable and its probability distribution\nfunction can be deduced from the averages Mkde\ufb01ned over the set {\u03bbm1,\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, \u03bbmk}.

One can proceed by straightforward numerical integra tion of, for example, the\nLangevin equation [4], or Newton\u2019s equation in the molecula r dynamics method. Alter-\nnatively, one can apply the method of Monte Carlo simulation [1, 2, 3]. The complete\ndescription of the model and simulation methods is given in [ 5] based on the package\nmanycopdeveloped by Yu.A. Kuznetsov.\nThere are two obvious restrictions on the set of all possible updates or moves of\nthe system. Namely, we must ensure polymer connectivity, an d excluded volume. In a\ncontinuous\u2013space model one requires a calculation of all fo rces to ensure that excluded\nvolume is preserved, and there is an inner \u201cspace\u201d loop in the Monte Carlo code. This\ncan be avoided in a model with a \ufb01nite\u2013size discrete space, si nce a look\u2013up table is used\nto manage this procedure. The dynamics can be performed by pe rmutations of monomer\nand solvent beads on the lattice. We call such a permutation a n elementary move.\n4 M-T. KECHADI, R.G. REILLY, K.A. DAWSON, YU.A. KUZNETSOV, andE.G. TIMOSHENKO\nWe consider a model of a copolymer consisting of only two di\ufb00e rent monomer types\ndistributed in a certain way along the chain. The total numbe r of each monomer type is\nheld \ufb01xed for every con\ufb01guration in the ensemble. The chain s tructure does not change\nunder time evolution.\nWe work on a three-dimensional lattice with unit spacing. We restrict our model\nby making the following particular choices of elementary mo ves. The maximum distance\nbetween the nearest neighbors along the chain (NNC) is equal tormax=\u221a\n3. Thus,\nfor every bead the NNC are located in the nearest lattice site s along the vertices of the\nlattice, or on second or third lattice neighbors. This condi tion provides for connectivity\nof the chain. Furthermore, excluded volume is incorporated by ensuring that only NNC\nare permitted in the nearest neighbor lattice sites, i. e. th e minimum distance between\nbeads is rmin= 1 for NNC beads (NNC cannot overlap), and rmin=\u221a\n2 otherwise.\nThe model discussed above is described by the Hamiltonian,\nH=1\n2/summationdisplay\ni/negationslash=jw(rij)Isisj, (2)\nwhere i,jenumerate lattice sites; silabels the state of site i,Isisjis a 3x3 symmetric\nmatrix and the matrix indices sitake three di\ufb00erent values, solvent sand monomer\ntypes denoted as aandb. Here we denote rij=|ri\u2212rj|. For short\u2013range interactions\nwe take the weight function w(r) = 0, for r > R max, where Rmaxis some range of\ninteraction. As in Ref. [5] we choose w(1) = 1, w(\u221a\n2) = 1, w(\u221a\n3) = 0 .7,w(2) = 1 /2\nandw(r) = 0 for r >2. Thus, the range of interaction includes the nearest and se cond\u2013\nnearest neighbors. We have used the Metropolis algorithm [1 , 2, 3] for calculation of the\ntransition probability in a system at temperature T.\nCopolymers can be described by three independent Flory para meters:\n\u03c7aa=2Isa\u2212 Iaa\u2212 Iss\nkBT,\n\u03c7bb=2Isb\u2212 Ibb\u2212 Iss\nkBT, (3)\n\u03c7ab=Isa+Isb\u2212 Iab\u2212 Iss\nkBT.\nIn fact, we shall consider only a special cut of parameter spa ce with the condition,\nIaa+Ibb= 2Iab. We can therefore reduce the number of parameters to two via t he\nrelation, \u03c7ab= (\u03c7aa+\u03c7bb)/2. We further restrict our model by assuming that the\na\u2013monomers are hydrophilic, \u03c7aa= 0.\n4. \u2013 Method of Painting\nThe painting method was used to identify the two types of mono mer - hydrophobic\nand hydrophilic. For a given hydrophobicity percentage the method consists in coloring\nthe interior of the globule with a radius corresponding to th e hydrophobicity ratio \u03c4b.\nFor this we consider that the globule is spherical with radiu s (Rg\u00b1\u03b4r) with \u03b4r< \u01ebr,\nwhere \u01ebris the maximum value, and is called parameter of compactness .\nThere are di\ufb00erent ways to implement the painting procedure , depending on the\nconstraints to be satis\ufb01ed. For example, if the globule is co nsidered a sphere, the easiest\nway is to mark hydrophobic all the monomers in a \ufb01xed radius Rbwhich corresponds\nA STUDY OF SEQUENCE DISTRIBUTION ETC. 5\n-0.1-0.0500.050.10.150.20.250.30.35\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120\nm\u2732\u03b3m\u273b\nFig. 2. \u2013 Correlation function \u03b3m=1\nN\u2212m/summationtext\nn\u03b3n,n+mfor\u03c4b= 10% and sequence length N=\n120 (circles).

Rbis called the hydrophobic radius and the\ndi\ufb00erence ( Rg\u2212Rb) is the depth of painting.\nAnother method consists in bringing the centre of mass of the globule to the origin\nof a 3-D Cartesian grid. Calculate the coordinates of the hyd rophobic radius along the 3\naxes (x, y, z). This method is quicker than the \ufb01rst; marking p rocess consists of a simple\ncoordinate test for each unit compared to those in the radius of hydrophobicity.\nThe advantage of these two methods is their simple implement ation. However the\nconstraint imposed on the form of the globule is very restric tive, especially for short\nsequences, since: 1) a collapsed globule is never a perfect s phere and 2) the coordinates\nof monomers in the lattice are integers. These approximatio ns cause anomalies in the\n\ufb01nal form of the globule.\nThe method of painting we have chosen involves the regular hull . It consists of\nde\ufb01ning an internal volume of the same form as that of the glob ule. The method proceeds\nin two phases: 1) determining the units which constitute the surface of the globule\n\u0393g={u0, u1,\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, un}. 2) For each ui\u2208\u0393gits distance is calculated from the centre of\nmass of the globule Rui.

The simulations were run on workst ations (DEC Alpha 3100\nand SGI R10000). The method has two important steps which are very time consuming -\nMonte Carlo simulations and neural network windowing metho d. For each Monte Carlo\nsimulation run more than N2sweeps were carried out, which requires approximately N2\nseconds on the underlined machines. For N= 120, 4 hours CPU time required to bring\nthe initial sequence to folding state. Due to the enormous am ount of time needed to\nsimulate sequences of di\ufb00erent size, we only ran simulation s forN= 120 ,250,and 400.\nFor each \ufb01gure, we plotted both the simulation results and a t heoretical function\nthat approximates these results. This function is given by\ng(m) =A\u00d7exp(\u2212m\n\u03be)sin(2\u03c0m\nd+\u03c6) (4)\nwhere A, \u03be, d , and\u03c6are \ufb01tting parameters.

The\nonly di\ufb00erence between these 4 experiments is the hydrophob icity ratio. We distinguish\nthree di\ufb00erent regions in each graph. 1) initial region: the results are a\ufb00ected by two\nphenomena - the discretisation of the simulation space onto a lattice and the e\ufb00ect of\npainting which will be considered later. 2) the central regi on: results are stable and\ncoincide with equation 4. 3) Final region: this is character ized by a lack of correlations.\nSince the chains are open the ends tend to be more hydrophilic , clearly shown in \ufb01gure\n5.\n5.1.The E\ufb00ect of Painting . \u2013 The oscillations and their amplitudes are controlled by\nthe parameters \u03beandArespectively, and dcontrols the period. These three parameters\ndepend on the hydrophobicity ratio \u03c4b, and the sequence length N. We have determined\nthe function corresponding to each parameter, as well as the ir physical relation to the\npainting method applied to folded sequences. In what follow s we analyze the results of\nthe painting method and demonstrate its limitations.\nIn a statistically signi\ufb01cant way, it was shown that the amin o acid sequences in\nproteins di\ufb00er from what is expected from random sequences. The results of this study\nbased upon real protein sequences in the SWISS-PROT data bas e can be found in [7, 8].\nOur study con\ufb01rm the non-random distribution of hydrophobi c-hydrophilic monomers\nalong the chain, and indicate that part of that correlation m ay be due to an implied\ngeometry of the condensed globule.\nIt is well known that the folding process brings residues geo metrically close together\nwhich are also close along the chain. These residues are clas si\ufb01ed as domains. The\ncurrent painting method does not take domains into account. Quite interesting results\nfor the monomer structure of folded sequences are obtained a pplying the method to\nshort sequences with an appropriate hydrophobicity ratio ( Figure 3). In the case shown\nin \ufb01gure 3 the domain structure does not get overwhelmed by th e large globule volumes.\nWhen the domain structure is very small with respect to the gl obule volume only\nthose monomers at the border of the two volumes (global and hy drophobic) are considered\n(see Figure 6). This border is negligible compared to the res t of the globule. It is vital\nto take the domain structure into account to extend the paint ing method beyond the\nglobule core.\n5.2.Improvement . \u2013 To overcome the limitations of the preceding method we mus t\ntherefore take the domain structure into account. We procee d as follows:\n1. let \u03c4andNbe the hydrophobicity ratio and the sequence length respect ively.\n2. choose a point P0belonging to the globule such that the distance from P0to the\nsurface of the globule is bigger than \u03c4.\n3. mark the monomers belonging to the volume of radius \u03c4and centre P0, and derive\nthe characteristics of the folding structure of the monomer s (using the correlation\nfunction).\n4. repeat steps 2 and 3 with a new point until all possible poin ts have been chosen.\n5. calculate the total correlation function from the preced ing ones.\n8 M-T.

However it is very tim e consuming, since all\npoints which satisfy the hydrophobicity radius \u03c4must be examined. The method uses\nthe same exploration procedure as the neural network window ing method.\n5.3.Neural Network . \u2013 Arti\ufb01cial neural networks are usually used to \ufb01nd an ap-\nproximate solution to a precisely (or an imprecisely) formu lated problem. ANNs are\ncharacterized by the network topology, the connection weig ht between pairs of nodes,\nnode properties, and the de\ufb01nition of updating rules. Usual ly, an objective function is\nde\ufb01ned that represents the complete state of the network, an d its set of minima corre-\nspond to di\ufb00erent stable states of the network. Learning in a n ANN, whether supervised\nor unsupervised, is accomplished by adjusting the weights b etween connections in re-\nsponse to new inputs or training patterns.\nThe advantage of the neural network approach is that it allow s us to generalize our\npredictions about the compactness of folded proteins beyon d the sequences used to train\nthe network. The results of the neural network method are ful ly described in [6].\n10 M-T. KECHADI, R.G. REILLY, K.A. DAWSON, YU.A. KUZNETSOV, andE.G.

This techniqu e used two complementary\nmethods - painting method and neural network windowing meth od. The \ufb01rst one is\nsuitable to the short sequences. As opposed to the painting m ethod the ANN windowing\nmethod has non-local e\ufb00ect in the folding process (length of sequences, etc.). However,\na learning process is needed in order to predict the goodness of folded structure for any\nsequence length.\nWe deduce that there are implied chain sequence correlation s indicating a sort of\nblock-like structure to the hydrophobic-hydrophilic stru cture. We see from the \ufb01tting\nof the experimental function \u03b3mby the theoretical one g(m) that increasing the depth\nof painting increases the correlation length \u03be, while it has practically no e\ufb00ect on the\nperiodicity dor phase \u03c6. The periodicity dis believed to be related to the size of the\nglobule while the phase \u03c6to the actual procedure involved and thus both are independe nt\nof the painting depth.\nThe method presented here is very time consuming especially the Monte Carlo sim-\nulation and neural network steps. The performance of these m ethods can be improved\nby using high performance and e\ufb03cient parallelization tech niques.\n\u2217 \u2217 \u2217\nThe authors acknowledge interesting discussions with Dr A.

Here we study the\nfunctionally independent clusters in which the relevant el ements, introduced and stud-\nied in our \ufb01rstpaper [3], are subdivided. We show that the pha se transition in Random\nBoolean Networks can also be described as a percolation tran sition. The statistical\nproperties of the clusters of relevant elements (that we cal lmodules) give an insight\non the scaling behavior of the attractors of the critical net works that, according to\nKau\ufb00man, have a biological analogy as a model of genetic regul atory systems.\n1 Introduction\nKau\ufb00man networks are networks of randomly interconnected bina ry elements under recip-\nrocal regulation. Every node is controlled by Kelements extracted at random in the set of\nthe nodes. The boolean control rules, which associate a binary valu e to every con\ufb01guration\nof the controlling elements, are also extracted at random at the be ginning and kept \ufb01xed\nduring the evolution of the system.\nThe relevant parameter of the distribution of the control rules is \u03c1, the probability that\ntwo di\ufb00erent con\ufb01gurations of the controlling elements produce a d i\ufb00erent output. For every\nvalue of the bare connectivity Kthere is a critical value of \u03c1,\u03c1c= 1/K, which separates a\nfrozen phase (small \u03c1) from a chaotic one (large \u03c1). According to Kau\ufb00man [1], this model\nreproduces on its critical line some features of the genetic regulat ory systems acting in the\ncells.\nIn the preceding paper [3] we de\ufb01ned the relevant elements of Kau\ufb00 man networks, which\nare the only elements that in\ufb02uence the asymptotic dynamics, and w e measured their dis-\ntribution. We refer to that paper for the description of the prope rties of the model, of\nthe distribution of the relevant elements and of the relations betwe en the number of rele-\nvant elements and the properties of the limit cycles of the dynamics. In the present paper\n1\nwe are going to describe how such elements are spontaneously orga nized into dynamically\ndisconnected clusters that we will call modules.\nIt is known [7] that some of the elements in the network evolve to a co nstant state\nindependent of the initial con\ufb01guration and don\u2019t take part to the a symptotic dynamics.\nThe relevant elements are the elements whose state is not constan t and that control at least\nonerelevant element. Thus every relevant element must becontro lledby atleast onerelevant\nelement (eventually itself) and must control at least one of them (e ventually itself). It is\nthen clear that loops of relevant elements must exist.\nThe set of relevant elements can thus be partitioned into di\ufb00erent c lusters, that we call\nmodules, de\ufb01ned by the following equivalence relation: two relevant e lements belong to the\nsame module if one of them controls the other one. It is clear from th is de\ufb01nition that\nelements in di\ufb00erent modules cannot communicate among each other after a transient time:\nthus the dynamics induce spontaneously upon the network a cluste rization of the relevant\nelements. The number of the limit cycles and their lengths depend only on this modular\norganization.\nAs expected, the statistical properties of the modules are very d i\ufb00erent in the two dy-\nnamical regimes of the model.\n\u2022In the frozen phase the number of relevant elements remains \ufb01nite in the in\ufb01nite size\nlimit [4, 3]. In this case, on the ground of the argument presented in [3 ], we expect that\nthe modules are, in the in\ufb01nite size limit, loops of e\ufb00ective connectivity exactly equal\nto 1 (i.e., every relevant element is under the control of only one relevant e lement),\nand that the distribution of modules and, consequently, the numbe r and the length of\nthe attractors depend in this phase only on the parameter c=K\u03c1 <1.\n\u2022In the chaotic phase the number of relevant elements is proportion al toN, and the\nnumber of irrelevant elements tends to zero very fast as the bare connectivity increases\n(already for K= 3 and\u03c1= 1/2 the fraction of irrelevant elements is about 0 .01 for an\nin\ufb01nite system). The set of the relevant elements is fully connected in the in\ufb01nite size\nlimit, where the number of modules tends to 1 also for K= 3 and\u03c1= 1/2, as we shall\nsee below. Nevertheless, in chaotic systems with low connectivity so me signatures of\na modular organization are present as a \ufb01nite size e\ufb00ect.\n\u2022At the border between the two phases, the critical line shows an int eresting behav-\nior. Here the number of relevant elements scales as\u221a\nN,i.e.the number of relevant\nelements increases with system size but they become more and more sparse. In this\nsituation we expect that also the number of modules grows with syst em size, and that\nis actually what we observe in our simulations. The increase of the ave rage number\nof modules is slow, apparently logarithmic in N, but it is responsible of important\ne\ufb00ects, such as the fact that the average weights of attraction basins tends to zero in\nthe in\ufb01nite size limit, or that the distributions of the length and the nu mber of the\nlimit cycles become broader and broader as Nincreases.\nThus the phase transition in Kau\ufb00man model is reminiscent of a perco lation transition.\nBelow the threshold, the set of relevant elements is divided into a \ufb01nit e number of \ufb01nite\nclusters. Above, it is completely connected. In critical systems, a n in\ufb01nite number of\n2\nclusters is present. In this case it is an open problem whether the pr obability that all the\nrelevant elements are connected tends to zero or to a \ufb01nite limit in th e in\ufb01nite size limit.\nDerrida and Stau\ufb00er were the \ufb01rst ones to notice the analogy with p ercolation theory\nfor a lattice version of Kau\ufb00man model [5]. The study of the modular o rganization shows\nthat the analogy with percolation theory remains pertinent also in th e model with random\nneighbors.\nWe start presenting our numerical results from the statistical an alysis of the divisors of\ncycle lengths (section 2), which allows the simplest numerical investig ation of the modular\norganization. Section 3 isabout thedirect measure ofthe distribut ion ofthe number andsize\nof modules, both in the chaotic phase and on the critical line. In sect ion 4 we show how the\nnumber ofmodules andthee\ufb00ective connectivity dependonthenum ber ofrelevant elements.\nA simple argument predicts the qualitative behavior of these quantit ies in agreement with\nnumerical results. Section 5 concerns the relation between the nu mber of modules and the\nlength and number of the limit cycles, and section 6 deals with the distr ibution of attraction\nbasins weights, interpreting results that we presented in [8]. An ove rall discussion concludes\nthe paper.\n2 Divisors of cycle length\n2.1 Analytic considerations in the frozen phase\nThe distributions of the length of the cycles in critical networks ( K= 2,\u03c1= 1/2) and\nsupercritical networks close to the phase transition ( K= 3,\u03c1= 1/2) show an oscillatory\nbehavior: the cycles of even length are more frequent than the od d ones (in other words, the\nclosing probability is larger when a cycle of even length is reached) [6]. F igure 1 shows the\nperiod distribution for a network on the critical line, with K= 4 and \u03c1= 1/4.\nThis is what should be expected if the relevant elements are subdivide d into independent\nmodules. In this case an attractor is the composition of the local cy cles of the di\ufb00erent\nmodules, and its length is the least common multiple of the lengths of th e local cycles, so\nthat if at least one of the modules has a local cycle of even length also the global cycle\nwill be even. Studying in more detail the statistical properties of th e numbers that are\ninteger divisors of cycle length it is thus possible to test this hypothe sis and to obtain\nqualitative informations about the distribution of the modules, while t he direct inspection\nof the modules is numerically more cumbersome (with this method it is en ough to simulate\none or two trajectories in every network, while for the direct stud y of the relevant elements\nand of the modules several hundreds of trajectories must be simu lated).\nWe simulated two large systems in the chaotic phase and on the critica l line, generating\nthousands of sample networks and two trajectories on each of th em. For any small integer l\nup tolmaxwe measured the probability to \ufb01nd an attractor with length multiple o fl,Pd(l),\nand, only for those networks where the two trajectories had rea ched di\ufb00erent attractors, we\nmeasured the conditional probability that the length of the second cycle is multiple of lgiven\nthat the length of the \ufb01rst one is multiple of l(we call this quantity Pd(l|l)). We measured\nsuch quantities for di\ufb00erent sets of networks, de\ufb01ned by the con dition that both cycles are\nshorter than a threshold length L0, and studied how the results vary as a function of L0.\n3\nP\nt1 5 10 50 10010\u00f9-410\u00f9-310\u00f9-210\u00f9-1\nFigure 1: Probability to \ufb01nd a cycle with period tin a random network with K= 2,\u03c1= 1/2\nandN= 120. The dotted line is the probability that the transient time i s equal to t.\n4\nAs discussed in [3], there is a positive correlation between the length o f the cycles and the\nnumber of relevant elements in a network, so that we expect that t he condition imposed on\nthe length of the cycles selects networks with less and less relevant elements as L0decreases.\n2.2 Critical system\nWediscuss separately theresults obtainedfor thecritical andfor the chaotic system, starting\nfrom the former one, which is a system with 2160 elements and param etersK= 4 and\n\u03c1=\u03c1c= 1/4.\nInthis case themodular organizationisvery evident. In thecase of a RandomMap, Pd(l)\nis proportional to 1 /l. In the present case, instead, we have to distinguish between valu es of\nlwhich are prime numbers and values which are not prime. For lprime the probability Pd(l)\nhas initially a value larger than 1 /l(for instance, Pd(2) = 0.87 when cycles shorter than 512\nare selected), but then decreases faster than l\u22121. The decrease become faster when shorter\ncycles are selected. This fact is consistent with the hypothesis of t he modular organization,\nand, within this interpretation, shows that the probability to \ufb01nd a m odule with local cycle\nlarger than ldecays faster than 1 /l, and even faster if the number of relevant elements is\nsmall.\nIflis not prime, on the other hand, Pd(l) is larger than for the prime numbers nearby,\nand it is usually close to the product of the probability of its prime fact ors (see \ufb01gure 2).\nThis is a strong hint to interpret these prime factors as the length o f the local cycles of\nindividual modules\nThe e\ufb00ect of changing the threshold on cycle length, L0, is shown in \ufb01gure 3. For a \ufb01xed\nl, the probability to \ufb01nd a cycle whose length is a multiple of lincreases, reach a maximum\nvalue and then decreases. Since the abscissa can be related to an in creasing number of\nrelevant elements, a possible interpretation of this behavior is that the number of modules\n\ufb01rst increases with the number of relevant elements, then reache s a maximum value and\nultimately decreases. We will see in section 4 that this is just what hap pens.\nAt last, the condition that we already found in the same network a cy cle multiple of\nllargely improves the probability to \ufb01nd another cycle multiple of l, consistently with the\nmodular interpretation. This probability decreases when we select n etworks characterized by\nlonger attractors (this can be interpreted as another indication o f the fact that the number\nof modules may decrease as the number of relevant elements increa ses).\n2.3 Chaotic system\nThe network that we examined is close to the critical phase: K= 3,\u03c1= 1/2,N= 100. This\nis a very large size concerning the duration of the simulation, since in t he chaotic phase the\nlength of the cycles increases exponentially with system size, but it s till shows important\n\ufb01nite size e\ufb00ects. We think that the signs of the modular organizatio n that we observed\ncan disappear in an in\ufb01nite system, since this signs decrease when we select networks with\nlonger attractors, i.e.with more relevant elements, and in an in\ufb01nite system the fraction of\nrelevant elements tends to 0 .99. A direct study of the modules for smaller systems shows in\nfact that the average number of modules tends to 1 in this limit (see n ext section).\n5\nlPd(l)\n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 20 300.010.050.100.501.00\nFigure 2: Probability to \ufb01nd a cycle of length multiple of l, wherelis a prime number, in\ncritical networks with K= 4,\u03c1= 1/4andN= 2160.

Also this probability is larger when lmay be decomposed\ninto prime factors. However this features tend to disappear when larger cycles are selected,\nandPd(l) approaches 1 /lwhen the threshold L0increases, thus indicating that the modular\norganization tends to disappear when the number of relevant eleme nts increases.\nCorrelations between the divisors of di\ufb00erent cycles on the same ne twork seem to be\npresent (the conditional probability Pd(l|l) is larger than Pd(l)), but they are of little signif-\nicance (the di\ufb00erence between the two probabilities is, at most, of t he order of two or three\nstandard deviations) and our simulations can not even prove that s uch correlations exist.\nIn any case the correlations, if any, are much smaller than in the crit ical system, and they\nappear to decrease when networks with longer attractors are se lected.\n3 Distribution of modules\nIn this section we deal with a direct study of the number of modules. Before presenting the\nresults that we obtained, however, we shall describe brie\ufb02y our alg orithm, also in order to\ngive an operative de\ufb01nition of the modules.\nThe \ufb01rst step, as it is discussed in [3], consists in identifying the stable elements. To\nthis aim we simulate 300 trajectories for each of the networks that we generate. The stable\nelements are those ones that reach the same stable state in all the di\ufb00erent runs. The set of\nthe unstable elements is then reduced to the relevant elements alon e (the ones that control\nat least one relevant element), and in this process the irrelevant co nnections are eliminated\n(the connection between aandbis irrelevant if the response function does not depend on the\nstate ofawhen all the stable values of the stable elements have been substitu ted in it, i.e.\nif the function reduced to the unstable arguments alone is a consta nt function of the state\nofa). Now every relevant element receives a di\ufb00erent label, and the follo wing procedure is\niterated: if either acontrolsborbcontrolsa, and their labels are di\ufb00erent, their labels are\nset equal to the smaller one, and all the labels equal to the one that is changed are set to\nthe same value. We check that no label is changed more than once in a n iteration. When no\nlabel changes anymore the iterations are interrupted. At this poin t to every di\ufb00erent label\ncorresponds a di\ufb00erent module, and we count their number and the ir size.\n3.1 Chaotic systems\nWe start to present results relative to the chaotic phase, where t he existence of a modular\norganization appears only as a \ufb01nite size e\ufb00ect. We investigated num erically systems not\nfar from the critical line, with K= 3,\u03c1= 1/2 andNcomprised between 20 and 75. For\nsuch systems, the probability to generate a network with more tha n one module tends to\nzero roughly as 1 /N.\nComparing this result with the analysis of the divisors of cycle length ( section 2) we see\nthat the modular organization is not the only explanation for the high frequency of even\nperiods, which would be smaller if it were due only to the presence of di\ufb00 erent modules. It is\n8\npossible however that some other structures generalizing the not ion of module can give the\nsame e\ufb00ect and are present with larger probability. For example, we can de\ufb01ne in-going and\noutgoing submodules as sets of relevant elements that do not, res pectively, receive from or\nsend to the outside any relevant signals. The length of a local cycle is then multiple of the\nperiod of all the in-going submodules, and the situation described in t he previous section\nmay occur because of the submodules. Another structure that c ould play a role is that of\ncycle-depending modules. Globally stable elements are de\ufb01ned as the elements that reach\nthe same \ufb01xed state independently on the initial con\ufb01guration. The elements stable on a\ncycle are a subset of those, and are de\ufb01ned as the elements whose value does not change\nalong the cycle. Thus the network can be decomposed into cycle-de pending modules that\ndo not communicate between each other when the system is on the a ttractor. Once again,\nthe period of the attractor is the least common multiple of the period s of all cycles of the\npartial modules that compose it. Or it may be that the statistical pr operties of the divisors\nof cycle length do not depend on the presence of modules.\nHowever, it is clear that the modular organization tends to disappea r in the in\ufb01nite size\nlimit.\n3.2 Critical systems\nThe distributions of the number of modules in critical systems with K= 4 and \u03c1= 1/4\nhave a maximum corresponding to a single module and then decrease r oughly exponentially,\nbut with a rate that becomes slower and slower as system size increa ses (\ufb01gure 4). The\nprobability to \ufb01nd a single module, or no module at all (this means that a ll the elements\nare stable) decreases with system size, while the probabilities to \ufb01nd 2 or more modules\nincreases. It is not clear whether the probability of networks with o nly one module tends to\nzero or to a \ufb01nite limit. The average number of modules increases with system size. T, and\nthe best \ufb01t is logarithmic:\n\u221dangbracketleftNmod\u221dangbracketright \u22480.40+0.39logN. (1)\nWe prefer the logarithmic \ufb01t to a power law with a small exponent, also compatible with\nour data, for two reasons: \ufb01rst, because the inclusion of the larg estNvalue modi\ufb01es the \ufb01t\nparameters by 5 percent in the \ufb01rst case and by 10 percent in the s econd one, and second\nbecause at the \u201ccritical point\u201d K= 1,\u03c1= 1 the analogy between the modules and the cycles\nof a Random Map shows that the average number of modules grows lo garithmically with\nsystem size in this case [4]. This point is not a real critical point since it is not at the border\nbetween two phases (with K= 1 only the frozen phase is possible), but still the analogy\nwith it can give useful indications.\nMostofthemoduleshaveonlyoneelement, andthedistributionofth esizeofthemodules\ndecreases monotonically. The probability to \ufb01nd a module with 1, 2 or 3 elements depends\nvery little on the system size N. On the other hand, this probability increases with Nfor\nmodules of large size (\ufb01gure 5), consistently with what we saw in [3]: th e number of relevant\nelements, which is the sum of the sizes of all the modules, scales as\u221a\nNon the critical line.\n9\n0 2 4 6\nm10\u2212410\u2212310\u2212210\u22121100Pm(m)\nN = 120\nN = 240\nN = 480\nN = 720\nN = 1280\nN = 1600\nFigure 4: Distribution of the number of modules in a random network at t he critical point\nK= 4and\u03c1= 1/4.Nis ranging from 120 to 1600.\n10\nRP\nFigure 5: Distribution of the number of modules with Rrelevant elements, at the critical\npointK= 4,\u03c1= 1/4;Nis respectively equal to 120 (squares), 240 (X) and 480 ( \u2666).\n11\n4 E\ufb00ective connectivity\nIn this section we examine how the number of modules depends on the number of relevant\nelements. A useful notion to understand this relation is the e\ufb00ectiv e connectivity of the\nnetwork. Also in this case the simulations were done with critical netw orks with K= 4 nd\n\u03c1= 1/4.\nWe plot in \ufb01g. 6 the average number of modules as a function of the nu mber of relevant\nelements in the network, R, for systems of di\ufb00erent sizes. This quantity shows a non mono-\ntonic behavior: the number of modules increases with Rat the beginning, then it reaches a\nmaximum and starts to decrease towards the value 1.\nThe plot of the average number of relevant elements as a function o f the number of\nmodules (\ufb01gure 7) contains a similar information. Contrarily to the na ive expectation, the\nlargest number of relevant elements is attained in networks with only one module. It seems\nthat then the curve reaches a minimum and starts to increase, but we have the networks\nwith such a large number of modules are very rare and we can not mak e any signi\ufb01cant\nstatement about this point.\nIt is not di\ufb03cult to explain qualitatively this behavior. At this end we use the same\nargument that we used in [3] to estimate the scale of the number of r elevant elements. We\nsuppose to add a new element to a network with Rrelevant element. If the new added\nelement happens to be relevant, three situations are possible:\n1. The new relevant element is added to a previously existing module an d the number of\nmodules does not change;\n2. The new relevant element constitutes a new module itself and the n umber of modules\nincreases by one unit;\n3. The new relevant element connects two modules and the number o f modules decreases\nby one unit.\nWhenNis large all other possibilities can be neglected. The situation is trivial in the\nfrozen phase, where an asymptotic (for large N) distribution of the relevant elements is\nreached and all the three cases above have negligible probability, an d in the chaotic phase,\nwhere only one module is present in systems of large size, but it is very interesting on\nthe critical line, since the properties of the attractors vary acco rding to which of the three\nsituations is the typical one.\nTo understand how the number of modules depends on Ron the critical line, we have to\ncompare case 2 and case 3. If, for a given value of R, the second case prevails, the number\nof modules increases with R. In the other case, it decreases. The probability of case 2\nshould not depend on R, while the probability of case 3 is proportional to/summationtext\nininj, where\nniis the size of module iand the sum runs over di\ufb00erent modules. When Rincreases, we\nshould expect this quantity to increase so that case 3 prevails. The quantity that allows to\nunderstand quantitatively the situation is the average rescaled siz e of a module, de\ufb01ned as\nS2=/angbracketleftBigg/summationdisplay\nin2\ni//parenleftBigg/summationdisplay\nini/parenrightBigg2/angbracketrightBigg\n.

In critical networks,\nthis quantity is much smaller than the bare connectivity, K, and tends to 1 as a power law\nwhenNincreases. We are interested to the behavior of Keffas a function of the number of\nrelevant elements inthenetwork (inotherwords, Keff(R)isaconditioned average, restricted\nto the set of networks with exactly Rrelevant elements).\nFor large Rthis function is asymptotic to a straight line with intercept close to 1 ( see\n\ufb01gure 8)2. It holds:\nKeff(R)\u2248a(N)R+b(N), (3)\nwhere the parameter adecreases as a power law: a(N)\u22481.7N\u22120.93, andb(N) tends to 1\nfrom above (every relevant element must have at least one relevan t connection, so that Keff\ncan not be less than 1).\nThis is very close to what we expect on the basis of the above argume nt [3]. We expect\nthat the conditional probability that the new element has two releva nt connections, given\nthat it is a relevant element, is proportional to R/N2. This is a quantity of order 1 /N, so this\nargument predicts a(N)\u221d1/N, to be compared with our best numerical \ufb01t a(N)\u221dN\u22120.93.\nFrom this argument, we would expect also that Keff=b(N)+\u221dangbracketleftR\u221dangbracketrighta(N) is equal to 1 plus a\nterm vanishing as 1 /\u221a\nN. It turns out, however, that the correction decreases as N\u22120.3: this\ndiscrepancy is due to the term b(N), and we don\u2019t have a good explanation for it.\nThebehaviorofthee\ufb00ective connectivity andthatofthenumber o fmodulesasafunction\nofRshowtheexistence ofacrossover between twosituationsreminisc ent ofthetwo phasesas\nthe number of relevant elements changes along the critical line. For smallRwe \ufb01nd networks\nwith small e\ufb00ective connectivity: most of the modules are loops wher e each relevant element\nhas only one connection, as it is typical in the frozen phase. To the o pposite side, where R\nis large, the networks are much more connected and there are few modules. This situation\nis similar to what happens in chaotic networks, but on the critical line o nly a \ufb01nite number\nof elements have more than 1 connection in the in\ufb01nite size limit.\nWe thus expect that the properties of the attractors change wid ely with the number of\nrelevant elements, from a situation reminiscent of the frozen phas e to a situation reminiscent\nof the chaotic phase. We dedicate the rest of this paper to describ e how the properties of\nthe attractors are in\ufb02uenced by the properties of the modules.\n5 Attractors and modules\n1In this context, we say that element ahas a connection with element bonly ifais controlled by b, and\nnot ifbis controlled by a.\n2Of course, Keffshould saturate to a value smaller than Kwhen all elements are relevant, but such\nnetworks occur with negligible probability on the critical line.\n15\n0.0 5.0 10.0 15.0\nr0.01.02.03.04.0KeffN = 120\nN = 240\nN = 480\nN = 780\nN = 1280\nN = 1600\nFigure 8: E\ufb00ective connectivity in networks with Rrelevant nodes as a function of r=\nR/N1/2at the critical point K= 4,\u03c1= 1/4.\n16\n5.1 Simply connected modules\nWe saw in the previous section that the e\ufb00ective connectivity of crit ical and frozen systems\ntends to 1 in the in\ufb01nite size limit. This means that most of the elements receive and\nsend only one relevant signal. Thus simply connected modules play an im portant role in\ncritical networks, and are found with probability one in the frozen p hase. Such modules\nwere analytically studied by Flyvbjerg and Kjaer in the case of K= 1 networks [4]. Here\nwe recall for completeness their properties, adding some more info rmation.\nA simply connected module is a loop of relevant elements i= 1,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7l, such that the node\ni\u22121 controls node ithrough the Boolean function fi(\u03c3) (we assume periodic boundary\nconditions). There are only two kinds of non-constant Boolean fun ctions of one Boolean\nargument: tautology ( f(\u03c3) =\u03c3) and contradiction ( f(\u03c3) =\u03c3).\nThe number and length of the cycles of such modules do not depend o n the details of\nthe distribution of the Boolean functions, but only on the parity of t he number of negative\nfunctions [4]. All the 2lcon\ufb01gurations of the module belong to some cycle of length equal\nto an integer divisor of l(if the number of negative functions is even) or of 2 l(if it is odd):\nin fact, after at most lsteps in the \ufb01rst case, and 2 lsteps in the second one, every initial\ncon\ufb01guration is reproduced. This is the \ufb01rst important property: the length of the cycles\nincreases only linearly with the size of the module.\nThe number gl(m) of cycles of length min a module of size lis easily found. First, it\nis easy to see that gl(m) does not depend on l. In fact, let us assume an even number of\nnegative functions. A module made out of lelements may be thought of as the repetition of\nkmodules made of melements, as mmust be an integer divisor of l=km. But for all the\ninitial con\ufb01gurations whose periodicity is mthe dynamics is independent on the value of k;\non the other hand, the con\ufb01gurations that are not periodic in spac e can not be reproduced\naftermsteps. For an odd number of negative functions the argument is ex actly the same,\nbut thekmodules of size mcan be equal only if kis odd. Thus gl(m) depends only on m\nand on the parity of the number of negative functions, that we sha ll denote by a superscript:\n(0) to indicate even, and (1) to indicate odd. It holds\n/summationdisplay\n{m|l/minteger }mg(0)(m) = 2l, (4)\n/summationdisplay\n{m|l/modd}2mg(0)(2m) = 2l, (5)\nwhence it can be seen that g(0)(l) is asymptotic to 2l/landg(1)(2l) is asymptotic to 2(l\u22121)/l.\nIn the large llimit, most of the cycles have the maximal length.\n5.2 Global attractors\nA global attractor is made out of the composition of the limit cycles of all the modules. Its\nperiod is thus the least common multiple of the periods of the cycles th at compose it. The\nnumber of attractors is larger than or equal to the product of th e number of cycles in the\ndi\ufb00erent modules. In fact the number of attractors that can be f ormed with a set of limit\ncycles, each one taken from a di\ufb00erent module, is equal to the maxim um common divisor of\nthe periods of the cycles.\n17\nEven in the absence of an analytic description of the statistical pro perties of the modules,\nthe study of the modular structure allows us to better interpret t he numerical results about\nthe distributions of the number andof the length of the attractor sin critical networks [8] and\nsheds light on the large size behavior of these quantities. In the follo wing we will concentrate\nour discussion on critical networks.\nFirst, we note that the two extremal situations of very high and ve ry low connectivity,\nwhich are reminiscent respectively of the chaotic and of the frozen phase, are expected to be\nvery di\ufb00erent also from the point of view of the properties of the at tractors.\nIn high connectivity critical networks the attractors are reminisc ent of the chaotic phase\n(we have to remember, nevertheless, that for critical networks Kefftends to 1 in the in\ufb01nite\nsize limit, so that high connectivity means that there is a large but \ufb01nit e number of elements\nwith two connections. Such networks are characterized, as it is dis cussed above, by few\nmodules of large size). We observed in fact that the average length of the cycles increases\nexponentially with the number of relevant elements for large R, as it happens in the chaotic\nphase. Thus in such networks the average length of the cycles sho uld increase as a stretched\nexponential of system size. This result is consistent with the fact t hat the distribution of\nthe length of the cycles seems to have an e\ufb00ective scale increasing a s a stretched exponential\n[8]. Similarly, we expect that the number of attractors in such netwo rks is not very large (in\nthe chaotic phase the number of attractors increases linearly with the number of relevant\nelements), but we don\u2019t have data to compare to this prediction.\nIn low connectivity critical networks there are several modules wit h very few elements.\nMost of the modules are just loops with e\ufb00ective connectivity exact ly equal to 1, so that\nthe length of the local periods is proportional to the size of the loop and the number of cy-\ncles increases almost exponentially with it. Thus, in this situation we ex pect to \ufb01nd a very\nlarge number of attractors, exponentially increasing with the numb er of relevant elements.\nThis means that in such networks the number of cycles should increa se approximately as a\nstretched exponential of system size. The distribution of the num ber of attractors is consis-\ntent with this prediction, since it has an e\ufb00ective scale increasing as a stretched exponential\nof system size. On the other hand, we expect to \ufb01nd in such networ ks short cycles: the typ-\nical length should be the minimal common multiple of the size of the modu les, and it should\nincrease as the square root of the number of elements, as far as t he number of modules is\nnot very large. But, as Nincreases, this scaling should be lost and substituted by a faster\nincrease.\nIt can thus be understood why both the distributions of the length of the cycles and the\ndistribution of their number become broader and broader when sys tem size increases: in the\nensemble of critical networks quite di\ufb00erent situations coexist. It seems also that networks\ncharacterized by a small number of short attractors (meaning by this that the number and\nthe length increase not faster than a power law of N) can be found only if the number of\nrelevant elements is very small, thus with vanishing probability as Nincreases. However,\nthis qualitative picture still requires more accurate further invest igations to be con\ufb01rmed or\nrejected.\n18\n6 Attraction basins\nWhile the number and the length of the attractors depend only on th e number and the size\nof the modules, this is not true for the size of the attraction basins .\nIn fact, when we extract at random an initial con\ufb01guration, the ele ments that are going\nto become stable are not yet stable and the modules are not yet for med (the case K= 1\nis an exception, since in this case the modules are present from the b eginning), since the\nelements of di\ufb00erent modules can still communicate. Thus the attra ction basins of two\ncritical networks with the same modular structure but with di\ufb00eren t bare connectivity don\u2019t\nneed to be identical. In fact, we expect that the attraction basins for critical systems are\nlarger the larger is K, since then \u03c1c= 1/Kis smaller and a large number of the input\ncon\ufb01gurations produce the same state. In the following, we will be m ainly dealing with\ncritical systems, unless otherwise stated.\nThe simulations of critical systems with K= 2 and K= 4 con\ufb01rm that, for a given\nsystem size, the attraction basins are on the average larger for K= 4 than for K= 2 [8],\nbut show also that the main characteristics of the distribution of th e weight of the attraction\nbasins are the same in both cases. The weight of the attraction bas in\u03b1,W\u03b1, is de\ufb01ned as the\nfraction of con\ufb01gurations that evolve towards attractor \u03b1. This quantity has to be averaged\nover all the attractors and over several realizations of the dyna mical rules. Following [9] we\nuse the notation\n\u221dangbracketleftY2\u221dangbracketright=/summationdisplay\n\u03b1/angbracketleftBig\nW2\n\u03b1/angbracketrightBig\n. (6)\n(the angular brackets represent the average over the disorder ).\nFor both the Kvalues that we examined, \u221dangbracketleftY2\u221dangbracketrightvanishes as system size increases, and\nin both cases our data are compatible with a power law decay with the s ame exponent for\nthe two parameters considered, suggesting that this behavior is u niversal along the critical\nline. Moments of higher order of the weight of the attraction basins also seem to vanish as\na power law of system size, but with an exponent which is not proport ional to the order of\nthe moment, so that a typical weight of the attraction basins can n ot be de\ufb01ned and the\ndistribution of the weights has multi-fractal properties [10].\nThe fact that the average weight of the attractor basins vanish in the in\ufb01nite size limit\ncan be qualitatively explained considering the modular structure of c ritical networks. We\nmeasured \u221dangbracketleftY2\u221dangbracketrightselecting only networks with a number mof modules and we observed that\nthis conditional average is a decreasing function of m, as \ufb01gure 9 shows.\nThis behavior has a clear explanation in networks with K= 1, where the modules are\nindependent form the beginning. In this case, two con\ufb01gurations b elong to the same attrac-\ntion basin if and only if all their components on di\ufb00erent modules belong to the attraction\nbasins of the same local cycles. Since all such components are extr acted independently, the\nprobability of such an event is the product of the probabilities relativ e to individual modules\nand vanishes as the number of modules increases. This reasoning ca n not be applied to\nnetworks with connectivity larger than one, as we said previously, b ut the result that the\naverage value of Y2decreases with the number of modules remains valid also in this case.\nOn the other hand, the average weight of the attraction basins ha s not a monotonic\nbehavior as a function of the number of relevant elements in the net work,R. This fact\n19\n0 1 2 3 4 5\nm0.00.20.40.60.81.0<Y2>N = 120\nN = 240\nN = 480\nN = 720\nN = 1280\nN = 1600\nFigure 9: Conditional average of Y2=/summationtext\n\u03b1W2\nain networks with mmodules. K= 4,\u03c1= 1/4.\n20\ncan be explained as a consequence of the fact that the number of m odules does not grow\nmonotonically with the number of relevant elements in the network. I n the low-connectivity\nregime the number of modules increases with R, thus the weight of the attraction basins\ndecreases. The contrary happens in the high-connectivity regime .\nThese characteristics do not change in the chaotic phase. Also for chaotic systems the\naverage weight of the attractionbasins decreases with the numbe r of modules in thenetwork,\nbut in this case the probability to \ufb01nd more than one module goes to ze ro in the in\ufb01nite\nsize limit, and the e\ufb00ects of the modular organization disappear. In p articular, the average\nbasin weight remains \ufb01nite and its limit value appears to be very close to the Random Map\nvalue\u221dangbracketleftY2\u221dangbracketright= 2/3, as predicted by the annealed approximation [6].\nWeobserved insimulations reportedin[6]thatinchaoticsystems not farfromthecritical\nline (K= 3,\u03c1= 1/2) the average basin weight, \u221dangbracketleftY2\u221dangbracketright, is not a monotonic function of system\nsize: at \ufb01rst it decreases with N, then attains a minimum value of about 0 .59 atN= 40\nand starts to increase, apparently toward the Random Map value o f 2/3. One could think\nthat this not monotonic behavior is related to the modular structur e, supposing that its\ne\ufb00ects are not monotonic in system size. This does not appear to be the case, as the same\nnot monotonic behavior as a function of system size can be observe d restricting the sample\nto networks with a single module (they are the big majority even for s mall sizes, in the\nchaotic phase). Nevertheless, it is possible that the extension of t he concept of modules\nthat we proposed in section 2 in order to \ufb01ll the gap between the obs erved distribution of\nmodules and the e\ufb00ects of factorization of cycle lengths can give a b etter comprehension of\nthis behavior.\n7 Discussion\nThe dynamical transition taking place in Kau\ufb00man networks can be ch aracterized as a\npercolation transition in the set of the relevant elements (the analo gy with percolation was\nalready proposed by Derrida and Stau\ufb00er with respect to Random b oolean networks on a\nlattice [5]).\nIn the frozen phase, the relevant elements are \ufb01nite in number also in the in\ufb01nite size\nlimit and they are divided into asymptotically independent modules. In t he chaotic phase\nall the relevant elements belong to the same cluster, and their numb er is proportional to\nsystem size. At the border between these two phases, the critica l line is characterized by a\nnumber of relevant elements increasing as\u221a\nNand a number of modules that grows with\nsystem size (apparently with a logarithmic behavior).\nCritical networks have a wide range of modular structures, rangin g from networks remi-\nniscent of the frozen phase (with few relevant elements and low e\ufb00e ctive connectivity and a\nnumber of modules that increases with the number of relevant eleme nts) to networks remi-\nniscent of the chaotic phase (with many relevant elements, larger e \ufb00ective connectivity and\na number of modules that decreases with the number of relevant ele ments).\nThe modular organization can explain qualitatively \u2013 and, maybe, also q uantitatively\n\u2013 the main properties of the attractors of critical networks. The se attractors are the com-\nposition of the undecomposable cycles of the elements of the single m odules, so that their\n21\nlength is the minimal common multiple of the lengths of these cycles and their number is\nthe product of the numbers of these cycles. One expects then th at networks closer to the\nfrozen phase, whose modules have e\ufb00ective connectivity very clos e to 1, are characterized\nby a large number of attractors (exponentially increasing with R, the number of relevant\nelements) whose length increases as Ror faster. In networks close to the chaotic phase, on\nthe other hand, one expects to \ufb01nd less attractors (for the sam e value of R), but longer ones.\nThis is in agreement with the observed distributions of the number an d of the length of the\nattractors, that become broader and broader as system size inc reases.\nIt seems to us that these results imply that the typical values of th e number and of the\nlength of the attractors increase asymptotically faster than any power law. In simulations of\nsmall systems, Kau\ufb00man [1] observed that this quantities behave a s\u221a\nN. Simulating larger\ncritical systems [8], we observed that the distributions of these qu antities are compatible\nwith two e\ufb00ective scales, one increasing as\u221a\nNand another one, for rare but not vanishingly\nrare networks, increasing as a stretched exponential of N. This observation is consistent\nwith the conclusions that can be drawn from the study of the modula r organization.\nThe study of the modular structure can also explain why the averag e weight of the\nattraction basins of critical networks vanishes in the in\ufb01nite size limit .\nThusitwouldbeinterestingtoinvestigateanalyticallythedistribution ofsizeandnumber\nof the modules. We think that the approach that we used to estimat e the number of relevant\nelements, consisting in adding a new element to the network and comp uting the modi\ufb01cation\nof the modular structure, could be a good tool for a more quantita tive understanding of the\nmodular organization of critical networks, if the approximation tha t we used can be in some\nway controlled.\nThe modular organization of Kau\ufb00man networks is a consequence of the \ufb01nite connectiv-\nity of this model. It is because of the \ufb01nite connectivity that some ele ments become stable,\nand act as a barrier in the transmission of information among di\ufb00eren t modules. Thus the\nstructures described in this work are peculiar to this kind of cellular a utomata, and they are\nnot common to other models, for other aspects very similar to this o ne, such as asymmetric\nneural networks. It would be interesting to understand if and how the existence of a modular\norganization is related to the biological situation that Kau\ufb00man netw orks are intended to\nmodel,i.e.genetic regulatory systems.\nWethinkthatthespontaneousemergenceofamodularorganizatio nincriticalnetworksis\none of the most interesting features of such systems, and could h ave played an important role\nin the emergence of cellular organization from an hypothetical netw ork of chemical reactions\nwhere the primordial regulatory rules were of a probabilistic type. O ne of the advantages\nof modularity is the possibility to build many independent objects, whic h could have been\nshaped more easily by natural selection. This interpretation is highly speculative but very\nappealing, and raises for the biological modelization the challenging qu estion about the\nmechanisms which could drive to criticality such an hypothetical ense mble of self regulated\nchemical reactions.\nWe argue from this study that for large system size the typical sca le of the number and of\nthe length of the attractors increase much faster than\u221a\nN, as it was observed by Kau\ufb00man\nin early works [1]. The\u221a\nNlaw was considered by Kau\ufb00man an important argument in\nfavor of the fact that randomly assembled networks of regulator y systems can behave in a\n22\nway very reminiscent of the behavior of true biological organisms. T his law, and thus the\nbiological analogy, still holds approximately for a small enough numbe r of elements. When\nthenumber of genes becomes large, on theother hand, thenumbe r of cycles (in thebiological\nmetaphor, the number of cellular types) and especially their length ( which in the biological\nmetaphor represents cycle cell time) become too large to allow a biolo gical interpretation. In\nthis case it seems unlikely that critical random boolean networks beh ave as control networks\nin the cells, and that the scaling laws observed for real organisms ar e just a re\ufb02ex of the\ntypical properties of random regulatory networks. Random boole an networks with a number\nof elements of the same order as the number of genes in higher euka riots have with \ufb01nite\nprobability too many and too long attractors, and some kind of selec tion must come into\nplay to maintain the approximate power law scaling observed for small systems. But it may\nbe that genetically interesting networks are not vanishingly rare in t he ensemble of critical\nKau\ufb00mannetworks in the in\ufb01nite size limit. In the biological picture pro posed by Kau\ufb00man,\nthiswouldmeanthatsomepropertiesofrealcellscanstillbeinterpr etedastypical properties\nof an ensemble of randomly assembled regulatory networks, even if this ensemble has not to\nbe identi\ufb01ed with the whole ensemble of critical Kau\ufb00man networks.\nAcknowledgments\nU.B. would like to thank Henrik Flyvbjerg and Peter Grassberger for interesting discussions\nand for reading the manuscripts.\nReferences\n[1] S.A.

Introduction\nBiologically active proteins fold into a native compact structure desp ite the huge number of possible\ncon\ufb01gurations [1]. Though the mechanism of protein folding is not fully understood, it has been known\nsince the re-folding experiments of An\ufb01nsen [2] that globular prote ins fold in the absence of any catalytic\nbiomolecules. From this fact, it has been established that for prote ins,the three dimensional folded structure\nis the minimum free energy structure, and, the information coded in the amino-acid sequence is su\ufb03cient\nto determine the native structure [3]. The compactness of this uniq ue native state is largely due to the\nexistence of an optimal amount of hydrophobic amino-acid residues [4], since these biological objects are\nusually designed to work in water [5]. The relation between the primary one dimensional sequence and the\n\ufb01nal compact three dimensional structure is the task of the prot ein folding problem.\nIn addition to the paradoxicalproblem ofkineticsand time scalesoft he foldingprocess[6], there is another\nmystery. If proteins are made randomly by amino acids, the number of all possible such proteins with typical\nlength of 100, is far larger than the number of proteins which actua lly occur in nature. One hypothesis is\nthat the naturally selected sequences are special because they a re coded for structures that have unique and\nstable native states, allowing for easy folding. Thus a central ques tion of protein evolution is how mutational\nchange in the amino acid sequence leads to changes in the structure and stability.\nSome e\ufb00orts have been made in order to study the stability of prote ins against mutation by searching the\ntwo dimensional con\ufb01guration space [7,8]. One simple model used in the se studies is the H-Pmodel [9]. In\nthis model there are only two types of chain monomers, hydrophob ic (H) and polar ( P). Every H-Hcontact\nbetween topological neighbours is assigned a negative contact ene rgy, and other contact interactions are set\nto zero.\nRecently Li et al.[10], have looked at this problem in three dimensions. Calculating the en ergy of all\npossible 27-mers in all compact three dimensional con\ufb01guration, th ey have found that, there are a few\nstructures, into which a high number of sequences uniquely fold. Th is structures were named \u201dhighly\ndesignable\u201d and the number of sequences which fold into each state was named its \u201ddesignability\u201d. In their\nH-Pmodel, they choosethe contact energybetween HandPmonomersby somephysical arguments[10,11].\nOther signi\ufb01cant points of their work are: a) Only a few percent of s equences have unique ground state; b)\nThere is a jump in energy gap for these highly designable structures . Thus the highly designable structures\nare more stable against mutation and thermal \ufb02uctuation.\nDill and Chan [12] have argued that many of the phenomena observe d in proteins can be adequately\nunderstood in terms of the H-P model, but according to the work of Pandeet al.[13] the designability of a\nconformation does depend on the nature of interactions between monomers. May be any interaction leads\nto some highly designable structures, but di\ufb00erent interactions yie ld di\ufb00erent patterns.\nIn our work we study this problem for an additive potential. We will sho w that there are some highly\ndesignablestructuresforthispotential,butthelowdesignablestr uctureswilldisappearbecauseofdegeneracy\nof ground state. We will show that there is a ladder structure for e nergy levels for this form of potential. We\nthen add a non-additive part to the energy, then the ground stat e degeneracy of low designable structures\nwill be removed. We show there is a critical value for non-additive par t of potential, where below this critical\nvalue the patterns of highly designable structures are \ufb01xed, but a bove this critical value the designability of\nstructures is sensitive to the value of non-additive part of the pot ential. We show that the sequences which\nfold to highly designable structure are sensitive to mutation of some sites.\nAn additive potential has the following advantages:\na) It allows us to prepare a very fast algorithm which is then possible t o run on a PC.\nb) It enables us to solve and study some parts of the problem by com binatorial methods.\nc) It gives a clear picture for designability.\nd) A ladder spectrum for the energy levels results, thus it arms us t o study the problem for non-additive\npotentials.\n2\nII. The Model\nWe consider an H-Plattice model [9]. In this model only non-sequential nearest neighbo urs interact.\nBecause the native structures of proteins are compact with the Htype monomers sitting in the core, the\ne\ufb00ective potentials which are usually used, all of the forces are att ractive (negative values for potential) and\nthe strength of the force between H-Hmonomers is greater than others. We can write the general form o f\nthe potential in an arbitrary energy scale as:\nEPP= 0, E HP=\u22121, E HH=\u22122\u2212\u03b3. (1)\nThe most usual choice of H-Pmodel potential corresponds to the limit \u03b3\u226b1 [7\u20139,12], however physical\narguments are consistent with a smaller value for \u03b3, for instance \u03b3= 0.3 was used by Li et al.[10]. They\nhave calculated the energy of all of 227sequences in 103 ,346 compact con\ufb01guration for a 27-sites cube, by\na huge enumeration.\nIn the case \u03b3= 0, we have an additive potential. If we let H=\u22121, andP= 0, we can rewrite the\npotential in the form,\nE\u03c3i\u03c3j=\u03c3i+\u03c3j. (2)\nFollowing Li et al.[10], we consider only compact structures of sequences with length 27, occupying all\nsites of a 3 \u00d73\u00d73 cube [14]. There are 103 ,346 compact con\ufb01gurations which are not related to each other\nby rotation and re\ufb02ection symmetries. Let us call the set of all com pact structures, the structure space.\nA protein of length Nmay be shown by an N-component vector\n|\u03c3/an}bracketri}ht=|\u03c3i1,\u03c3i2,...,\u03c3 iN/an}bracketri}ht, (3)\nwherein= 1,2 refers to PandHresidues. Thus the number of such N-component vectors for proteins with\nlength 27 is 227. Let us call the set of |\u03c3/an}bracketri}ht, the sequence space.\nBecause of the additive form of the potential, we can write the ener gy of a given |\u03c3/an}bracketri}htin any spatial\ncon\ufb01guration as,\nE=27/summationdisplay\ni=1pi\u03c3i, (4)\nwherepi\u2019s are the number of non-sequential neighbours of the ith monomer, or by introducing the neigh-\nbourhood vector |P/an}bracketri}ht,\nE=/an}bracketle{t\u03c3|P/an}bracketri}ht.

This gives us an additional symmetry for the energy th at is di\ufb00erent from spatial symmetries.\nFor example any of the sites in a two dimensional 5 \u00d75 square for two spatial con\ufb01gurations which are shown\nin \ufb01gs. 1a and 1b, have equal neighbours, but the labels of their neig hbours are not the same. Visualisation\nof the same e\ufb00ect in 3 dimensions is a bit harder, but it dose exist.\nThe space of all 3 dimensional structures has 103 ,347 members for all compact full \ufb01lled structures in a\n3\u00d73\u00d73 cube. Due to this additional symmetry this space is divided into 6291 subspaces, where all members\nof each subspace have the same |P/an}bracketri}ht. Let the number of members of a subspace be, Nd. The range of Ndis\nfrom 1 to 96. Fig. 2, shows that the frequency of large values of Nd, is low. Interestingly there are a lot of\n|P/an}bracketri}ht\u2019s which only point to one structure.\n3\nt\nt\nt\nt\ntt\nt\nt\nt\ntt\nt\nt\nt\ntt\nt\nt\nt\ntt\nt\nt\nt\ntt\nt\nt\nt\ntt\nt\nt\nt\ntt\nt\nt\nt\ntt\nt\nt\nt\ntt\nt\nt\nt\nt\n(a) (b)123 4567\n8\n9\n10\n1112 131415 161718 19\n20\n21\n22\n232425 123 4567\n8\n9\n10\n1112 131415 16 21\n17\n18 1920222324\n25\nFIG. 1.

Histogram of Ndfor members of structure space. It is interesting that there are some Psets with Nd= 1.\nWe have calculated the energy of all 227|\u03c3/an}bracketri}hton all|P/an}bracketri}ht. We \ufb01nd the degeneracy of ground state in structure\nspace. One can see the distribution of number of ground state deg eneracies g, for all of 227sequences in \ufb01g.\n3. There are only a few sequences which have non-degenerate gro und state, this corresponds to the 8 .47%\nof sequences at g= 1. If energy of one sequence is minimised in a |P/an}bracketri}htwithNdgreater than one it has\ndegenerate ground state. According to de\ufb01nition of designability, such sequences should not be considered.\nThe distribution of Nsis presented for \u03b3= 0 in \ufb01g. 4. Comparing this \ufb01gure with \ufb01g. 2 of Li et al.[10],\nwe observe that there is no similarity. This suggests that designabilit y (Ns), is sensitive to the value of \u03b3,\nwhich is \u03b3= 0 in our work, whereas Li et al.chose\u03b3= 0.3. However as we shall see later, the fact that at\n\u03b3= 0, we have an additive potential plays an important role. In fact a s mall value of \u03b3radically change the\npicture.\n4\n1 10 100 1000 10000\ng101001000100001000001e+061e+071e+08Frequency\nFIG. 3. Histogram of degeneracy of ground state.

Energy levels\nThe number of non-sequential neighbours is related to type of site . A 3\u00d73\u00d73 cube has 8 corner sites\n(C), 12 link sites ( L), 6 face sites ( F), and one centre site ( O) (\ufb01g. 6). Csites have three neighbours, where\ntwo of them are connected by sequential links and there is only one n on-sequential neighbour. Similarly L,\nFandOsites have 2, 3 and 4 non-sequential neighbours respectively.

In a self avoiding walk in this cube, we must\njump in any step from one set to other. The \ufb01rst set has 14 member s and the second has 13. Thus a walk\npasses through CandFsites in odd steps, and through LandOsites in even steps. In other words, the\nodd components of |P/an}bracketri}htare 1 or 3, and even components are 2 or 4, (except the 1st and 27 th components\nwhich are like even components). Thus,\n|P/an}bracketri}ht=|p1,...,p 27/an}bracketri}ht, (6)\nwhere,\npi=/braceleftbigg\n1,3 odd i\u2032s;\n2,4 even i\u2032s.(7)\nTherefore the energy for a sequence \u03c3\u03b1in a structure P\u00b5is\nE\u03b1\u00b5=/an}bracketle{t\u03c3\u03b1|P\u00b5/an}bracketri}ht\n=/summationdisplay\ni\u2208odd(p\u00b5i\u22121)\u03c3\u03b1i+/summationdisplay\ni\u2208even(p\u00b5i\u22122)\u03c3\u03b1i+/summationdisplay\ni\u2208odd\u03c3\u03b1i+2/summationdisplay\ni\u2208even\u03c3\u03b1i.

(9) are independent of |X/an}bracketri}htor|P/an}bracketri}ht, thus they result in a constant, which can be ignored\nwhen comparing energies of a sequence in di\ufb00erent con\ufb01gurations. The \ufb01rst term in eq. (9) is an integer\ntimes two, thus it results in a ladder energy spectrum with gaps of 2. Therefore the energy gap for all of\nstructures is the same, and there is no di\ufb00erence between low desig nable and high designable structures.\nIV. Combinatorial Approach\nOur aim is to \ufb01nd the N\u2032\nsfor any spatial con\ufb01guration, determined by a vector |P/an}bracketri}ht. Because |X/an}bracketri}hthas a\nsimpler structure, than |P/an}bracketri}ht, we shall use |X/an}bracketri}htinstead of |P/an}bracketri}ht. Any vector |X/an}bracketri}ht, has seven 1\u2019s and twenty 0\u2019s.\nOne of the 1\u2019s is in the even sites, and the others are in odd sites. Ene rgy could be calculated by performing\na \u201clogical and\u201d of two binary numbers ( |\u03c3/an}bracketri}htand|X/an}bracketri}ht). For example, a typical |P/an}bracketri}htis,\nP.4 1 3 3 1 1 1 1 3 1 3 1 3 2\n2 2 4 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\nTo recognise odd and even components of the vectors, we show th em in the above form, writing the even\nsites below. The vector |X/an}bracketri}htcorresponding to the above |P/an}bracketri}htis,\nX.1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOn the other hand |\u03c3/an}bracketri}ht\u2019s have a similar form:\n7\n\u03c3.H0H H H 0 0 H0H H 0H H\n0H0H0 0 H H H 0 0 0 H\nWhere we show Pmonomers by numerical equivalence of them. Recall that numeric eq uivalence for H\nmonomers is \u22121. Energy of any sequence in any spatial con\ufb01guration is calculated by inner product of its\n|\u03c3/an}bracketri}htto corresponding |X/an}bracketri}ht. For the above |\u03c3/an}bracketri}htand|X/an}bracketri}htthe energy is 5 H. This value is related to exact value\nof energy according to eq.(9) by a factor of two and two sequence dependent additional terms, since we\nare interested in the ground state and the energy gap of a sequen ce, the sequence dependent term may be\nignored, as structure determines these quantities alone.\nBy construction any |X/an}bracketri}hthas six 1\u2019s in odd sites, and one 1 in even sites. If we don\u2019t consider any other\nconstraint for |X/an}bracketri}ht, we obtain an upper limit for number of |X/an}bracketri}ht\u2019s.\nn=/parenleftbigg14\n6/parenrightbigg\n\u00d7/parenleftbigg13\n1/parenrightbigg\n= 39039. (11)\nThis is far larger than the number of possible |X/an}bracketri}ht\u2019s which we have obtained by enumeration, that is 6291.\nThe fact that all 39039 possible con\ufb01guration don\u2019t exist points to e xtra constraints which are yet to be\ndiscussed. If all 39039 of |X/an}bracketri}ht\u2019s were to exist each of them would have to be unique ground state of only one\nsequence, thus removing all interest! To see this, it is enough to ins ert anHinto|X/an}bracketri}htwhere ever one \ufb01nds\na 1, and Pfor zeros. Indeed absence of some of these vectors in real world makes some of the other more\npreferable in nature.\nThe connectivity of a self avoiding walk, further constraints the |X/an}bracketri}ht. For example to pass through centre\nsite, the walk has to pass through two face sites. This means that t he only 1 (corresponding to centre site) in\neven sites must be sandwiched between two 1\u2019s in odd sites (face site s). This constraint reduces the number\nof possible |X/an}bracketri}ht\u2019s. Two 1\u2019s in odd sites are \ufb01xed by even 1, and only 12 sites remain for f our other 1\u2019s. Then\nthere are,\nn=/parenleftbigg12\n4/parenrightbigg\n\u00d7/parenleftbigg13\n1/parenrightbigg\n= 6435, (12)\nvectors. This number is still larger than exact number of |X/an}bracketri}hts by 144. Although due to our enumeration\nwe know these 144 vectors, we can not \ufb01nd the complex constraint s which prune them out, and we shall\ncontinue our calculation as though these 144 vectors were correc t. Of course the values are di\ufb00erent from\nexact enumeration, however it can be seen that this di\ufb00erence is no t too large, and it may be considered as\nan approximation to the exact solution. Also we aid a computer enume ration including the extra 144 vectors\nand have compared the results with the combinatorial calculation. T his has served as a check on our code.\nWe now proceed to calculate N\u2032\nsfor the following example:\nX0,1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nFirst let us introduce some new parameters and notations. We will sh ow the energy of a |\u03c3/an}bracketri}htin an|X/an}bracketri}htas:\nE=E(a,b,c) = (a+b+c)H, (13)\nwherea,bandcare related to energy parts which come from centre (1 in lower row) , faces which are\nconnected to centre, and energy of other parts, respectively. For example energy of following |\u03c3/an}bracketri}ht:\n\u03c3,H0H H 0H0 0 H H 0 0 H H\n0H0 0 H H H 0H0 0 H0\nin|X0/an}bracketri}ht, isE(0,2,3) = 5H.\n8\nBesides, we name the number of pairs of 1\u2019s in the upper row of |X/an}bracketri}htaszand the number of 1\u2019s in two\nends of vectors as y. For|X0/an}bracketri}ht,z= 2, and y= 1.\nNow we try to count the number of all polymers which have their ener gy minimised in |X0/an}bracketri}htand, there is\nno other |X/an}bracketri}htwith energy equal to ground state for them. To do this we discuss a ll possible cases.\ni:E(1,2,4)\nSuch polymers have at least seven Hsites corresponding to 1\u2019s of X0. These polymers have minimum\npossible energy, thus X0is a minimum energy con\ufb01guration for them. But it must be checked wh ether it is\na unique ground state or not. First consider polymers which in additio n to these seven H\u2019s have another H\nmonomer in their upper row sites,\n\u03c31.H0H H H 0 0 0 H0H0H0\n0 0 H0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nThe energy of this sequence in following |X/an}bracketri}htis 7Htoo.\nX1.1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nThen the ground state of polymers which have additional Hmonomers in corresponding to upper row 0\u2019s of\nX0, is degenerate, and they don\u2019t count in N\u2032\nsofX0. The above discussion is independent of value of aand\nbinE(a,b,4), and degrees of freedom to choose sites for Hmonomers is limited to lower row sites.\nFor the|X/an}bracketri}htwithz/ne}ationslash= 1 (like X0) polymers can not have Hmonomers in the lower sites between two upper\nrow 1\u2019s. For example, the following sequence,\n\u03c32,H0H H H 0 0 0 H0 0 0 H0\n0 0 H H 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nhas energy 7 Hin following |X/an}bracketri}httoo.\nX2.1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nThen the contribution of polymers with E(1,2,4) inN\u2032\nsis:\nN\u2032\ns(i) = 212\u2212(z\u22121)= 213\u2212z(14)\nii:E(0,2,4)\nIn this case if z >1 (such as X0) the ground state is degenerate. It can be seen that any sequen ce with\nenergyE= (0,2,4) inX0state has the same energy in X2state. In the case z= 1, only the sites in lower\nrow by condition that they are not a neighbour of corresponding up per 1\u2019s of X, have freedom to be an H\norPmonomer. There are 2 \u00d76\u2212z\u2212ysites which don\u2019t have this freedom in lower row. Then,\nN\u2032\ns(ii) =/braceleftbigg\n22\u2212yz= 1\n0 z >1(15)\n9\niii:E(1,0,4)\nIn this case there is only one sequence with nondegenerate ground state. For our example, X0, this\nsequence is,\n\u03c33.H0 0 0 H0 0 0 H0 0 0 H0\n0 0 H0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nIn the above sequence changing any Pmonomer to Htype, will cause the ground state to becomes\ndegenerate. Then,\nN\u2032\ns(iii) = 1 (16)\niv:E(1,1,4)\nFor this case bis 1, and if this 1 comes from right or left neighbour of lower 1, it has di\ufb00 erent solutions.\nThen we introduce new parameters ( zR,yR) and (zL,yL), which are similar to old zandy, when right or\nleft neighbour 1 of lower 1 will be omitted. For X0we have zR= 0,zL= 1 and yR=yL=y= 1. By\nintroducing this new parameters this case is very similar to case ii, and the di\ufb00erence comes from number\nof corresponding 1\u2019s in upper row (\ufb01ve instead six), and no restrict ion in value of z. Then,\nN\u2032\ns(iv) = 23+zR+yR+23+zL+yL. (17)\nv:Other cases\nAll of the other cases for ground state energy are degenerate, and need not be considered.\nWith this analysis it is possible to \ufb01nd N\u2032\nsfor any|X/an}bracketri}ht. For our X0example it is,\nN\u2032\ns(i) = 211\nN\u2032\ns(ii) = 0\nN\u2032\ns(iii) = 1\nN\u2032\ns(iv) = 24+25,\nthat gives,\nN\u2032\ns(X0) = 2097\nInthiswayallofthe valuesof N\u2032\ns\u2019scanbecalculated. Hadthe144additionalstructuresbeentaken out, the\ncalculation of N\u2032\nsfor the problem would correspond to enumeration exactly. Howeve r taking these structures\nout is too complex and would have to be done case by case. Besides of the value of N\u2032\ns, this calculation\nshows that the sequences whit non-degenerate ground state ha ve between 4 to 6 Htype monomers in face\nsites and no one in corner sites. Indeed in our model the stability of p olymers is very sensitive to mutation\nin corner sites.\nV. Nonadditive potentials\nIn the case \u03b3/ne}ationslash= 0 the potential is non-additive. In this case we can write the energ y of\u03b1th sequence in\n\u00b5th spatial con\ufb01guration as:\nE\u03b1\u00b5=/an}bracketle{t\u03c3\u03b1|P\u00b5/an}bracketri}ht\u22121\n2\u03b3/an}bracketle{t\u03c3\u03b1|M\u00b5|\u03c3\u03b1/an}bracketri}ht.

The \ufb01rst term in eq. (18) was calculated in the case \u03b3= 0, and\nwe need calculate only the last part. The aim of our calculation is to \ufb01nd the ground state. In any compact\ncon\ufb01guration in a 3 \u00d73\u00d73 cube, there are 28 non-sequential neighbour pairs. Thus the co ntribution of the\nlast term in energy is less than 28 \u03b3. We have shown that energy spectrum for the previous case has a ladder\nstructure with energy gap equal to 2. In this case these split to so me sublevels (\ufb01g. 7). Then if we choose\n\u03b3 <2\n28the levels are separate. Of course this is a lower estimation for \u03b3. In the next section we will obtain\na better estimate for lower and upper limits of the critical value of \u03b3.\n\u273b\n\u2744\u2206E\nE0\nE0\u2744\n\u273b\u2206E\n\u03b3= 0 \u03b3/ne}ationslash= 0\u273b\n\u2744\u273b\n\u2744\u03b4e1\n\u03b4e0\u2746\n\u2746\n\u2746\n\u2746\n\u2746\u2746\n\u2746\n\u2746\n\u2746\n\u2746\u2746\nFIG. 7. Energy levels of additive potential split to subleve ls for non-additive potential.\nFrom the result of the additive potential we have a subset Pin the space of all spatial con\ufb01gurations\nwhich gives the minimum energy to folding. This Psubset has Ndmembers which all of them have the same\n|P/an}bracketri}ht. For small \u03b3\u2019s the ground state and the \ufb01rst excited state are between these Ndstructures, and it is not\nnecessary to calculate the energy for all of 103 ,346 spatial structures for any sequence,except for sequences\nwhich their ground state is in structures with Nd= 1. For The Nd= 1 structures the value of Nsdoes not\nchange, and it is not necessary to run the program. The \ufb01rst excit ed state of these sequences are in an other\nPsubset. Thus to \ufb01nd the energy gap for them the program must be run over all of the 103 ,346 structures.\nWe have calculated this energy spectrum, and have found the new Nsfor all 103 ,346 structures. We show\nthe results for 51 ,704 con\ufb01guration which are unrelated by reverse labelling symmetry in \ufb01g. 8. We have\nfound the energy gap for \ufb01rst excited state for all sequences.

There is a jump in energy gap for highly designable structur es. All of\nthese highly designable structures have Nd= 1.\nIn this enumeration we have calculated the energy spectrum for all of the sequences which have nondegen-\nerate ground state for the additive potential. We had removed som e of the sequences because of degeneracy\nof ground state in additive potential case. It is possible that this de generacy will be removed by the non-\nadditive part of the potential, and some of the sequences haveuniq ue ground state for non-additive potential.\n12\nBut the energy gap for these sequences is of order of \u03b3, and if we consider them it causes a shift in horizontal\naxes to bigger Nsand bring down the points nearer to \u03b3value in vertical direction in \ufb01g. 9. These make\nthis \ufb01gure more similar to results of Li et al.[10]. In their work the energy gap for low designable structures\nare of order of \u03b3( they choose \u03b3= 0.3) also.\nVI. Estimation of \u03b3c\nThe energy levels for the additive potential have a ladder structur e, as it had been proven in previous\nsections. The energy gaps between the levels is 2 in our arbitrary en ergy unit.\nIn the case of \u03b3/ne}ationslash= 0 the energy has two parts (eq. 18). The \ufb01rst part comes from a dditive part of potential\nand does not change. Second part comes from non-additive part o f potential, and is equal to number of H-H\nnon-sequential neighbours in spatial con\ufb01guration. Because this non-additive part, the energy spectrum is\nchanged, and any level is splited to some sublevels (\ufb01g. 7).\nIf contribution of the second part to energy is less than 2, for all s tructures, the ground state and excited\nstate of any polymer is between |P/an}bracketri}htpartners of its ground state for additive potential , except for |P/an}bracketri}htwith\nNd= 1, where there is only ground state.\nLet\u03b4e0be the di\ufb00erence of ground state energies of additive and non-add itive potentials, and \u03b4e1be\ndi\ufb00erence energy of \ufb01rst excited state in the case of \u03b3= 0 with minimum of new energies for the sequence\nin the structures corresponding to these excited states (there is no uniqueness constraint for excited states).\nIf\u03b4e0\u2212\u03b4e1<2 the ground state doesn\u2019t change and the values of Nsfor structures that we presented in\npast section don\u2019t change. By increasing \u03b3, the absolute values of \u03b4e0and\u03b4e1increase.\nTo \ufb01nd the di\ufb00erence between \u03b4e0and\u03b4e1one have to calculate the di\ufb00erence in H-Hcontacts in ground\nstate structure and maximum of H-Hcontacts in excited level structures.\nThis di\ufb00erence has two sources. Because the energy levels in the ca se\u03b3= 0 are separated by 2, then\ndi\ufb00erence of them comes from replacing a Hmonomer from Osite to an Lsite, or from an Fsite to aCsite.\nBoth of them cause increasing in energy by 2. But it is possible that th ese replacing decrease the energy by\n2\u03b3. For example consider one Fsite with no Hneighbour will go to one Csite with two non-sequential H\nneighbours (this monomer must be an end residue). then this gives a n upper limit for \u03b3c, that is 1.\nThe other source for increasing the H-Hcontacts, comes from replacing Hmonomers in LandFsites by\nthe same type sites. These changes only are relevant in the case \u03b3/ne}ationslash= 0. The maximum of increasing in H-H\ncontacts because these replacing are 6 \u03b3, related to the sequences which have 4 Hmonomers in the Fsites\nand 5 to 7 in Lsites in their ground state structures. Thus the lower limit for \u03b3cis2\n2+6= 0.25. Therefore,\n0.25< \u03b3c<1. (20)\nThis shows that there is a non zero value for \u03b3c, which for \u03b3less than it, the ground state structure of\nsequences doesn\u2019t change. Indeed \u03b3cdistinguishes two phases. If \u03b3 < \u03b3 c, the degree of designability of\nstructures is independent of \u03b3, and the change in value of \u03b3only changes the energy gaps. On the other\nhand for \u03b3 > \u03b3 c, the designability of structures becomes sensitive to the value of \u03b3, and the patterns of\nhighly designable structures will be changed if the potential change s.\nIf the designability is the answer of \u201cwhy has the nature selected a s mall fraction of possible con\ufb01gurations\nfor folded states?\u201d, the above discussion shows that this selectio n is potential independent if \u03b3 < \u03b3 c, and\nsensitive to inter monomers interactions if \u03b3 > \u03b3c.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank J.

It is concerned with the problem of how a\nheteropolymer of a given sequence of amino acids folds\nintopreciselythat geometricalshapeinwhichit performs\nits biological function as a molecular machine [5,6]. Cur-\nrently, it is much simpler to \ufb01nd coding DNA \u2014 and,\nthus, also amino acid \u2014 sequences than to elucidate the\n3-dstructures of given proteins. Therefore, solving the\nprotein folding problem would be a major break-through\nin understanding the biochemistry of the cell, and, fur-\nthermore, in designing arti\ufb01cial proteins.\nIn this contribution we are concerned with the direct\napproach: given a sequence of amino acids, a molecu-\nlar potential, and no other information, \ufb01nd the ground\nstate and the equilibrium state at physiological temper-\natures. Note that we are not concerned with the kinetics\nof folding, but only in the \ufb01nal outcome. Also, we will\nnot address the problems of how to \ufb01nd good molecular\npotentials [7\u20139], and what is the proper level of detail\nin describing proteins [8]. Instead, we will use simple\ncoarse-grained models which have been proposed in the\nliterature and have become standards in testing the e\ufb03-\nciency of folding algorithms.\nAplethoraofmethodshavebeenproposedtosolvethis\nproblem, ranging from simple Metropolis Monte Carlo\nsimulations at some nonzero temperature [10] overmulti-\ncanonical simulation approaches [11] to stochastic op-\ntimization schemes based, e.g., on simulated annealing\n[12], and genetic algorithms [13,14]. Alternative methods\nuse heuristic principles [15], information from databases\nof known protein structures, [16], sometimes in combi-\nnation with known physico-chemical properties of small\npeptides.\nThe algorithms we apply here are variants of thepruned-enriched Rosenbluth method (PERM) [17]. This\nis a chain growth approach based on the Rosenbluth-\nRosenbluth (RR) [18] method. Preliminary results have\nbeen published before [19]. Here we will provide more\ndetails on the algorithm and on the analyses that can be\nperformed, and we will present more detailed results on\nground state and spectral properties, and on the folding\nbehavior of the sequences analyzed.\nTHE MODELS\nThe models we study in this contribution are het-\neropolymers that live on 2- and 3-dimensional regular\nlattices. They are self-avoiding chains with attractive or\nrepulsive interactions between neighboring non-bonded\nmonomers.\nThe majority of authors considered only two kinds of\nmonomers. Although also di\ufb00erent interpretations are\npossible for such a binary choice, e.g. in terms of positive\nand negative electric charges [20], the most important\nmodel of this class is the HP model [21,22]. There, the\ntwo monomer types are assumed to be hydrophobic (H)\nand polar (P), with energies \u01ebHH=\u22121, \u01ebHP=\u01ebPP=\n0 for interaction between not covalently bound neigh-\nbors. Since this parameter set leads to highly degener-\nate ground states, alternative parameters were proposed,\ne.g.\u01eb= (\u22123,\u22121,\u22123) [23] and \u01eb= (\u22121,0,\u22121) [24]. Note,\nhowever, that in these latter parameter sets, since they\nare symmetric upon exchange of H and P, the intuitive\ndistinction between hydrophilicand polarmonomersgets\nlost.\nAn interesting extension to the HP model can be ob-\ntained by allowing the interactions to be anisotropic.\nThis is done by introducing amphipatic (A) monomers\nthat have hydrophobic as well as polar sides [25]. Such\na generalization is possible for all lattice types, but we\ncon\ufb01ne ourselves to two dimensions (2d) here. It can be\n1\nshown that in this HAP model for a wide range of inter-\naction parameters the inverse folding problem \u2014 i.e. the\ndetermination of a sequence that has a particular confor-\nmation as ground state \u2014 can be solved by construction\n[25]. While 3-dimensional chiral amphipatic monomers\ncan be considered as well as non-chiral (the sides are\nallowed to rotate in the latter), in 2d only non-chiral\nmonomers are possible.\nIn the other extremal case of models, all monomers of\na sequence are considered to be di\ufb00erent, and interaction\nenergies are drawn randomly from a continuous distri-bution [26,27]. These models correspond, e\ufb00ectively, to\nassuming an in\ufb01nite number of monomer types.\nTHE SEQUENCES\nFor the above models various sequences were analyzed\nin the literature, and in [19] we took these analyses as a\ntest for our algorithm. Here we will take a closer look at\nthe properties of some of the sequences that were consid-\nered there.\nTABLE I.

These conformations were found by a spe-\ncially designed MC algorithm which should be particu-\nlarly e\ufb03cient for compact con\ufb01gurations.FIG. 1.

We choose a 3-helix structure with N= 42,\nsee Fig. 3, which is the ground state of the se-\nquencepA(HAAH)3PA3H10A3P(HAAH)3Ap, whereA\ndenotes an amphipatic intra-chain group with one hy-\ndrophobic and one polar side, while pdenotes an am-\nphipatic end group with one hydrophobic and two polar\nsides.\nFIG. 3. Ground state structure of the HAP sequence;\n(\ufb01lled circle) H monomers, (structured circle) A monomers,\n(open circle) P monomers.\n3d HP model\nTen sequences of length N= 48 were given in [30].\nEach of these sequences was designed by minimizing the\nenergy of a particular target conformation in sequence\nspace under the constraint of constant composition [31].The authors tried to \ufb01nd the lowest energy states with\ntwo di\ufb00erent methods, one being an heuristic stochastic\napproach [15], the other based on exact enumeration of\nlow energy states [32]. With the \ufb01rst method they failed\nin all but one case to reach the lowest energy. With the\nsecond method in all but one cases they obtained con-\nformations with energies that were even lower than the\nputative ground states the sequences were designed for,\nwhile forone casethe groundstateenergywascon\ufb01rmed.\nPrecise CPU times were not quoted.\n3d modi\ufb01ed HP model\nA most interesting case is a 2-species 80-mer with in-\nteractions ( \u22121,0,\u22121) studied \ufb01rst in [24]. These partic-\nular interactions were chosen instead of the HP choice\n(\u22121,0,0) because it was hoped that this would lead to\ncompact con\ufb01gurations. Indeed, the sequence was spe-\ncially designed to form a \u201cfour helix bundle\u201d which \ufb01ts\nperfectly into a 4 \u00d74\u00d75 box, see Fig. 4. Its energy in\nthis putative native state is \u221294. Although the authors\nof [24] used highly optimized codes, they were not able\nto recover this state by MC. Instead, they reached only\nE=\u221291. Supposedly, a di\ufb00erent state with E=\u221294\nwas found in [28], but \ufb01gure 10 of this paper, which is\nclaimed to show this con\ufb01guration, has a much higher\nvalue of E. Con\ufb01gurations with E=\u221294 but slightly\ndi\ufb00erent from that in [24] and with E=\u221295 were found\nin [29] by means of an algorithm similar to that in [28].\nFor each of these low energy states the author needed\nabout one week of CPU time on a Pentium.\nFIG. 4. Putative native state of the \u201cfour helix bundle\u201d\nsequence, see Table I, as proposed by O\u2019Toole et al.. It has\nE=\u221294, \ufb01ts into a rectangular box, and consists of three ho-\nmogeneous layers. Structurally, it can be interpreted as fo ur\nhelix bundles.\n3\n3d\u221emonomer types\nSequences with N= 27 and with continuous inter-\nactions were studied in [27]. Interaction strengths were\nsampled from Gaussians with \ufb01xed non-zero mean and\n\ufb01xed variance. These N(N\u22121)/2 numbers were \ufb01rst at-\ntributed randomly to the monomer pairs, then they were\nrandomly permuted, using a Metropolis accept/reject\nstrategy with a suitable cost function, to obtain good\nfolders. Such \u201cbreeding\u201d strategies to obtain good fold-\ners were also developed and employed by other authors\nforvariousmodels [31,33,34],and seemnecessarytoelim-\ninate sequences which fold too slowly and/or unreliably.\nIt is believed that also during biological evolution opti-\nmization processestook place with similare\ufb00ects, sothat\nactual proteins are better folders than random amino se-\nquences.\nTHE ALGORITHM\nThe algorithms we apply here are variants of the\npruned-enriched Rosenbluth method (PERM) [17], a\nchain growth algorithm based on the Rosenbluth-\nRosenbluth (RR) [18] method. There, monomers are\nplaced sequentially at vacant sites either with uniform\nprobability, or with some non-uniform probability distri-\nbution. In either case it leads to weighted samples where\neach con\ufb01guration carries a weight W. For long chains\nor low temperatures, the spread in weights can become\nvery wide which then leads to serious problems [35]. But\nsince the weights accumulate as the chains grow, one can\ninterfere during the growth process by \u2018pruning\u2019 con\ufb01g-\nurations with low weights and replacing them by copies\nof high-weight con\ufb01gurations. This is in principle simi-\nlar to population based methods in polymer simulations\n[36,37] and in quantum Monte Carlo (MC) [38], but the\nimplementation is di\ufb00erent. Pruning is done stochasti-\ncally: if the weight of a con\ufb01guration has decreased be-\nlowathreshold W<, itiseliminatedwithprobability1/2,\nwhile it is kept and its weight is doubled in the other half\nof cases. Copying (\u2018enrichment\u2019 [39]) is done indepen-\ndently of this. If Wincreases above another threshold\nW>, the con\ufb01guration is replaced by ncopies, each with\nweightW/n. Technically, this is done by putting onto a\nstack all information needed about con\ufb01gurations which\nstill have to be copied. This is most easily implemented\nby recursive function calls. Thereby one avoids the need\nfor keeping large populations of con\ufb01gurations [36\u201338].\nPERM has proven extremely e\ufb03cient for studies of lat-\ntice homopolymers near the \u03b8point [17]. It has also been\nsuccessfully applied to phase equilibria [40], to the order-\ning transition in semi-sti\ufb00 polymers [41], and to spiraling\ntransitions of polymers with interactions depending on\nrelative orientation of monomers [42]. We refer to thesepapers for more detailed descriptions of the basic algo-\nrithm.\nThe main freedom when applying PERM consists in\nthe a priori choice of the sites where to place the next\nmonomer, in the thresholds W<andW>forpruningand\ncopying,and inthe numberofcopiesmadeeachtime. All\nthese features do not a\ufb00ect the formal correctness of the\nalgorithm, but they can greatly in\ufb02uence its e\ufb03ciency.\nThey may depend arbitrarily on chain lengths and on\nlocal con\ufb01gurations, and they can be changed freely at\nany time during the simulation. Thus the algorithm can\n\u2018learn\u2019 during the simulation.\nIn orderto applyPERM to heteropolymersat verylow\ntemperatures,thestrategiesproposedin[17]aremodi\ufb01ed\nas follows.\n(1) For homopolymersnear the theta-point it had been\nfoundthat thebest choicefortheplacementofmonomers\nwas not according to their Boltzmann weights, but uni-\nformly on all allowed sites [17,40]. This might be surpris-\ning since the Boltzmann factor has then to be included\ninto the weight of the con\ufb01guration, which might lead to\nlarge \ufb02uctuations. Obviously, this e\ufb00ect is counterbal-\nanced by the fact that larger Boltzmann factors corre-\nspond to higher densities and thus to smaller Rosenbluth\nfactors [35].\nFor a heteropolymer this has to be modi\ufb01ed, as there\nis no longer a unique relationship between density and\nBoltzmann factor. In a strategy of \u2018anticipated impor-\ntance sampling\u2019 we should preferentially place monomers\non sites with mostly attractive neighbors. Assume that\nwe have two kinds of monomers, and we want to place a\ntype-Amonomer. If an allowed site has mBneighbors of\ntypeB(B=H,P), we select this site with a probability\n\u221d1+aAHmH+aAPmP. Here,aABare constants with\naAB>0 for\u01ebAB<0 and vice versa.\n(2) Most naturally, W>andW<are chosen propor-\ntional to the estimated partition sum Zn[17]. This be-\ncomes ine\ufb03cient at very low TsinceZnwill be underes-\ntimated as long as no low-energy state is found. When\nthis \ufb01nally happens, W>is too small. Thus too many\ncopies are made which are all correlated but cost much\nCPU time.\nThis problem can be avoided by increasing W>and\nW<during particularly successful \u2018tours\u2019 (a tour is the\nset of con\ufb01gurations derived by copying from a single\nstart [17]). But then also the average number of long\nchains is decreased in comparison with short ones. To\nreduce this e\ufb00ect and to create a bias towards a sample\nwhich is \ufb02at in chain length, we multiply by some power\nofMn/M1, whereMnis the number of generated chains\nof length n. WithN(n) denoting the number of chains\ngenerated during the current tour we used therefore\nW<=C Zn[(1+N(n)/M)(Mn+M)/(M1+M)]2,\nandW>=rW<. Here,Cis a constant of order unity,\nr\u224810, andMis a constant of order 104\u2212105.\n4\n(3) Creating only one new copy at each enrichment\nevent (as done in [17]), cannot prevent the weights from\nexploding at very low T. Thus we have to make several\ncopies if the weight is large and surpasses W>substan-\ntially. Agoodchoiceforthenumberofnewcopiescreated\nwhenW > W>is int[/radicalbig\nW/W>].\n(4) Two special tricks were employed for \u2018compact\u2019\ncon\ufb01gurations of the 2- dHP model \ufb01lling a square. First\nof all, since we know in this case where the boundary\nshould be, we added a bias for polar monomers to actu-\nally be on that boundary, by adding an additional energy\nof -1per boundary site. Note that this bias has to be cor-\nrected in the weights, thus the \ufb01nal distributions are un-\na\ufb00ected by it and unbiased. Secondly, in two dimensions\nwe can immediately delete chains which cut the free do-\nmain into two disjoint parts, since they never can grow\nto full length. In the present simulations, we checked\nfor this by looking ahead one time step. In spite of the\nadditional work this was very e\ufb03cient, since it reduced\nconsiderably the time spent on dead-end con\ufb01gurations.\n(5) In some cases we did not start to grow the chain\nfrom one end but from a point in the middle. We grew\n\ufb01rst one half, and then the other. Results were aver-\naged over all possible starting points. The idea behind\nthis is that real proteins have folding nuclei [43], and it\nshould be most e\ufb03cient to start from such a nucleus.\nIn some cases this trick was very successful and speeded\nup the ground state search substantially, in others not.\nWe take this observation as an indication that in vari-\nous sequences the end groups already provide e\ufb00ective\nnucleation sites. This is e.g. the case for the 80-mer\nwith modi\ufb01ed HP interactions of [24]. We also tried to\ngrow the chain on both sides simultaneously. However it\nturned out that this is not e\ufb00ective computationally [44].\n(6) In the case of the HAP model it turned out that,\nwhile the ground state con\ufb01guration of the chain geom-\netry could be reached easily, the ground state con\ufb01gura-\ntionsofthesidegroups(i.e., oftheH/Pbondattributions\nof amphiphilic monomers [25]) could note be reached ef-\nfectively using PERM alone. Therefore, after building\nthe chain conformation to its full length we let the side\ngroups of the amphipatic monomers rotate thermally us-\ning a Metropolis algorithm. This approach utilizes the\nshort relaxation time of side group \ufb02uctuations within\nthe subphase of a \ufb01xed chain conformation and leads to\nthe desired ground states [45].\n(7) For an e\ufb00ective sampling of low-lying states the\nchoice of simulation temperature Tappears to be of im-\nportance. Ifitistoolarge,low-lyingstateswillhavealow\nstatistical weight and will not be sampled reliably. On\nthe other hand, if Tis too low, the algorithm becomes\ntoo greedy: con\ufb01gurations which look good at \ufb01rst sight\nbut lead to dead ends are sampled too often, while low\nenergy con\ufb01gurations, whose qualities become apparent\nonly at late stages of the chain assembly, are sampled\nrarely. Of course they then get huge weights (since thealgorithm is correct after all), but statistical \ufb02uctuations\nbecome huge as well. This is in complete analogy to the\nslow relaxation hampering more traditional (Metropolis\ntype) simulations at low T\u2013 note, however, that \u201crelax-\nation\u201d in the proper sense does not exist in the present\nalgorithm.\nIn the cases we considered it turned out to be most ef-\nfective to choose a temperature that is below the collapse\ntransition temperature (note, however, that this transi-\ntion is smeared out, see the results below) but somewhat\nabove the temperature corresponding to the structural\ntransition which leads to the native state. This obser-\nvation corresponds qualitatively to the considerations of\n[46], although a quantitative comparison appears not to\nbe possible.\n(8) For 2-dimensional HP chains, we performed also\nsome runs where we restricted the search for native con-\n\ufb01gurationsfurther, by disallowingnon-bonded HP neigh-\nborpairs. The idea behind this wasthat sucha paircosts\nenergy, and is thus less likely to appear in a native state.\nBut this is only a weak heuristic argument. Forbidding\nsuch pairs certainly gives wrong thermal averages, and it\nmight prevent the native state to be found, if it happens\nto contain such a pair. But in two cases this restriction\ndid work, and gave states with lower energies than those\nwe could reach without this trick.\nRESULTS\nLet us now discuss our results. All CPU times quote\nbelow refer to SPARC Ultra machines with 167 MHz.\n2d HP model\n(a) For all chains of [13] we easily reached the ground\nstate, except for the longest chain ( N= 64). For this\nchain the ground state is very regular, with all polar\nmonomers on the outside, and with no non-bonded HP\nneighbors. Its energy is -42 (see \ufb01g.5). The authors of\n[13] were unable to recover by simulations this state and\nany other state with E <\u221237. Although we could not\nreachE=\u221242 either without special tricks, we obtained\nat least E=\u221240 after ca. 4h CPU time. Forbidding\nnon-bonded HP neighborpairs, wefound the nativestate\neasily, but thiscannotbe reallycountedasasuccesssince\nwe knew in advance that such pairs do not appear in the\nnative state. The di\ufb03culty posed by this sequence for\nPERM is obvious from \ufb01g.5: there is no folding center\nin this chain. No matter where one starts the assembly,\none \ufb01rst has to construct a large part of the boundary\nbefore the interiorbehind this boundary is \ufb01lled up. This\nintermediate state has a very low Boltzmann weight and\nacts thus as a bottleneck for PERM.\n5\nFIG. 5. One of the ground states of the N= 64 sequence\nof [13]. The other ground states di\ufb00er in the con\ufb01gurations\nof the chain ends \ufb01lling the interior of the structure, but ha ve\nthe same boundary and overall shape.\nNotethatthecon\ufb01gurationofFig.5cannotbeobtained\nby popular local moves including, e.g., bond exchange or\ncrankshaft, or by reptation. But it can be reached if\npivot moves are included. This illustrates that folding\nproperties can depend strongly on the chosen kinetics.\nIn contrast to the sequence with N= 64, we had no\nproblem with the shorter sequences of [13]. In particular,\nfor theN= 60 sequence we found a con\ufb01guration with\nE=\u221236 (see Table I), although the authors had quoted\nE=\u221234 as supposedly exact ground state energy.\nFIG. 6. One of the compact structures of sequence 1 with\nenergy (E=\u221246) lower than the \u201cnative\u201d state proposed by\nRamakrishnan et al..\n(b) For the two HP chains of [28] with N= 100, see\nTable I, we found several compact states (within ca. 40\nhours of CPU time) that had energies lower than those\nof the compact putative ground states proposed in [28].\nFigures 6 and 7 show representative compact structures\nwithE=\u221246 for sequence 1 and E=\u221247 for sequence\n2. Moreover, we found (again within 1-2 days of CPU\ntime) several non-compact con\ufb01gurations with energieseven lower: E=\u221247 andE=\u221248 for sequence 1 and\n2, respectively. Forbidding non-bonded HP pairs, we ob-\ntained even E=\u221249 for sequence 2. Figures 8 and 9\nshow representative non-compact structures with these\nenergies; a non-exhaustive collection of these is listed in\nFIG. 7.

While the structural transition to the\nground state phase is best monitored by the number of\nnative contacts and takes place around T= 1, the com-\npacti\ufb01cation of the polymer chain is most clearly seen in\nthe mean number of all contacts and in the radius of gy-\nration (not shown here). It takes place already at much\nhigher temperatures and is smeared out over a wide tem-\nperature range. Note that the number of all contacts\nfollows closely the behavior of the energy.\nThese two transitions are seen more clearly when the\n\ufb02uctuations of the above order parameters are consid-\nered, see Fig. 11. Energy and contact number \ufb02uctua-\ntions exhibit a broad maximum around T= 3.5, while\nthe structural transition is indicated by a narrow peak of\nthe \ufb02uctuations of the number of native contacts and ofthe speci\ufb01c heat near T= 1.0. Note that speci\ufb01c heat\nand energy \ufb02uctuations emphasize the two transitions\ndi\ufb00erently due to the factor T2by which they di\ufb00er.\n0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0\nT0.020.040.060.0\n<#native contacts2>\u2212<#native contacts>2\n<#contacts2>\u2212<#contacts>2\n(<E2>\u2212<E>2)/4\nspecific heat\nFIG. 11.

In these simulations we used a rather sim-\nple version of PERM, where we started assembly always\nfrom the same end of the chain. We found that the se-\nquences most di\ufb03cult to fold were also those which had\nresisted previous Monte Carlo attempts [30]. In those\ncases where a ground state was hit more than once, we\nveri\ufb01ed also that the ground states were highly degen-\nerate. In no case there were gaps between ground and\n\ufb01rst excited states, see Fig. 12. Therefore, none of these\nsequences is a good folder, though they were designed\nspeci\ufb01cally for this purpose.\n3d modi\ufb01ed HP model\nFor the two-species 80-mer with interactions\n(\u22121,0,\u22121), even without much tuning our algorithm\ngaveE=\u221294 after a few hours, but it did not stop\nthere.

With these, average times for \ufb01nding\nE=\u221294 andE=\u221298 in new tours are ca. 20 min and\n80 hours, respectively.\nA surprising result is that the monomers are arranged\nin four homogeneous layers in Fig. 13, while they had\nformed only three layers in the putative ground state of\nFig. 4. Since the interaction should favor the segregation\nof di\ufb00erent type monomers, one might have guessed that\na con\ufb01guration with a smaller number of layers should\nbe favored. We see that this is outweighed by the fact\nthat both monomer types can form large double layersin the new con\ufb01guration. Again, our new ground state is\nnot \u2018compact\u2019 in the sense of minimizing the surface, and\nhence it also disagrees with the wide spread prejudice\nthat native states are compact.\nIn terms of secondary structure, the new ground state\nis fundamentally di\ufb00erent from the putative ground state\nFIG. 13.

Figure 16 shows\nthese distributions, reweighted so that it corresponds to\nT= 0.75. The thermal behavior of these order parame-\nters as functions of Tis obtained by Laplace transform,\nand is shown in Fig. 17. The behavior of energy, end-to-\nend distance and radius of gyration follow closely each\nother and exhibit clearly only the smeared out collapse\nof the chain from a random coil to some unstructured\ncompact phase. In contrast, the speci\ufb01c heat exhibits\nmore structure: the shoulder around T= 1 corresponds\nagaintothecoil-globulecollapse, butthereareadditional\ntransitions seen around T= 0.62 andT= 0.45. The\nlast one is the transition to the \u03b2-sheet dominated na-\ntive phase. However, the transition at T= 0.62 is from\na unstructured globule to an intermediate phase that is\nhelix-dominatedbutexhibits strongtertiary\ufb02uctuations.\nThese structural transitions are illustrated in Figs 18 to\n22 where the thermally averaged contact matrices are\nshown for the respective phases.\nThe intermediate, helix-dominated phase is particu-\nlarly interesting. To it apply some of the usual charac-\nteristics of a molten globule state [51]: i) compactness,\nii) largesecondarystructurecontent (althoughnot neces-\nsarily native), and iii) strong \ufb02uctuations. This quali\ufb01esit as a candidate for a molten globule state, a phase that\nis absent in the folding transition of the HAP sequence\n[52].\n01020304050607080\n1020304050607080T=0.5\n>.0125\n>.025\n>.05\n>.125\n>.25\n>.5\nFIG. 20.

All sequences showed some gaps\nbetweenthegroundstateandthebulkoflow-lyingstates,\nalthough these gaps are not very pronounced in some\ncases.\nMore conspicuous than these gaps was another fea-\nture: all low lying excited states were very similar to\nthe ground state, as measured by the fraction of contacts\nwhich existedalsoin the nativecon\ufb01guration. Stated dif-\nferently, if the gaps were not immediately obvious, this\nwasbecausethey were\ufb01lled bycon\ufb01gurationswhichwere\nvery similar to the ground state and can therefore easily\ntransform into the native state and back. Such states\ntherefore cannot prevent a sequence from being a good\nfolder. For none of the sequences of [27] we found truely\nmisfolded low-lying states with small overlap with the\nground state.\nFigure 23 illustrates this feature for one particular se-\nquence. Thereweshowthe overlapQ, de\ufb01nedasthefrac-\ntion by non-bonded nearest-neighbor ground state con-\ntacts which exist also in the excited state, against the\nexcitation energy. For this and for each of the follow-\ning \ufb01gures, the 500 lowest-lying states were determined.\nWe see no low energy state with a small value of Q. To\ndemonstrate that this is due to design, and is not a prop-\nerty of random sequences with the same potential distri-\nbution, we show in Fig. 24 the analogous distribution for\na random sequence.0.00 0.05 0.10\n(E\u2212E0)/E00.500.600.700.800.901.00Q\nFIG. 23.

It contradicts\nthe claim of [26] that it is only the gap between native\nand \ufb01rst excited state which determines foldicity. On the\nother hand, our results are consistent with the \u201cfunnel\u201d\nscenario for the protein folding process [53], where the\nfolding pathway consists of states successively lower in\nenergy and closer to the native state.\nWe note that for random sequences there are also ex-\ncited states that have unit overlap with the native state,\na feature not present in the folding sequences. These\nare cases where the native state has open loops and/or\ndangling ends, so that more compact conformations have\nall contacts of the native state, but have \u2013 in addition\n\u2013 energetically unfavorable contacts resulting in a higher\ntotal energy.SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK\nWe showed that the pruned-enriched Rosenbluth\nmethod (PERM) can be very e\ufb00ectively applied to pro-\ntein structure prediction in simple lattice models. It is\nsuited for calculating statistical properties and is very\nsuccessful in \ufb01nding native states. In all cases it did bet-\nter than any previous MC method, and in several cases\nit found lower energy states than those which had previ-\nously been conjectured to be native.\nWe veri\ufb01ed that ground states of the HP model are\nhighly degenerate and have no gap, leading to bad fold-\ners. For sequences that are good folders we have estab-\nlished a funnel structure in state space: low-lying excited\nstates of well-folding sequences have strong similarities\nto the ground state, while this is not true for non-folders\nwith otherwise similar properties.\nEspecially, we have presented a new candidate for\nthe native con\ufb01guration of a \u201cfour helix bundle\u201d se-\nquence which had been studied before by severalauthors.\nThe ground state structure of the \u201cfour helix bundle\u201d\nsequence, being actually beta-sheet dominated, di\ufb00ers\nstrongly from the helix-dominated intermediate phase.\nThis sequence, therefore, should not be a good folder.\nAlthough we have considered only lattice models in\nthis paper, we should stress that this is not an inher-\nent limitation of PERM. Straightforward extensions to\no\ufb00-lattice systems are possible and are e\ufb03cient for ho-\nmopolymers at relatively high temperatures [17]. Pre-\nliminary attempts to study o\ufb00-lattice heteropolymers at\nlowThave not yet been particularly successful, but the\ninherent \ufb02exibility of PERM suggests several modi\ufb01ca-\ntions which have not yet been investigated in detail. One\nof them are hybrid PERM-Metropolis approaches simi-\nlar to that used for the HAP model in the present pa-\nper. Its success also suggests that similar hybrid ap-\nproaches should be useful for models with more compli-\ncated monomers. Another improvement of PERM which\ncould be particularly useful for o\ufb00-lattice simulations\nmight consist in more sophisticated algorithms for posi-\ntioning the monomers when assembling the chain. Work\nalong these lines is in progress, and we hope to report on\nit soon.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors are grateful to Gerard Barkema for help-\nful discussions during this work.

For homopolymers one can\nsee easily that this is not true. Attrition is actually de-\ncreased, since chains which have one end blocked can\nstill grow at the other end. But such chains have small\nRosenbluth factors and thus extremely low Win aver-\nage. Therefore, they just cost e\ufb00orts without e\ufb03ciently\ncontributing to statistical averages.

When a small \ufb02uorescent polystyrene\nmicrosphere is attached to a larger polystyrene microspher e, the larger sphere acts as a lens for the smaller\nmicrosphere and provides anoptical signal that isa strong f unction of the azimuthal angle. We demonstrate the\ntechnique by measuring the rotational diffusion constant o f the microsphere in solutions of varying viscosity\nand discuss the feasibilityof usingthis probe tomeasure ro tational motion of biological systems.\nThe commercial development of precision microspheres\nwithwellcontrolledsizesandvariousproteincoatingshas en-\nabled a number of new devices and experimental techniques,\nfrombeingthecomponentpartsinthefabricationofphotoni c\ncrystals[1]totheiruseas\u201chandles\u201dforopticaltweezersi nthe\nstudyofsingleprotein[2,3]andDNAmolecules[4].

Both these assays rely on imagingthe probeto de-\ntermineorientation,limitingthetimeresolutiontovideo rates\nontheorderof10Hz.\nAlthoughit isinferredfromtheswimmingspeedofmicro-\norganisms that bacterial \ufb02agella can turn at a top rotationa l\nspeed of 100,000RPM [10], measurement techniquescannot\nkeep up with those rates. Measurements are typically made\nbyforcingthe\ufb02agellatoturnalargemomentofinertiawhich\nslows the rotation rate to the region where it is accessible t o\nvideo analysis. Similarly, in studies of F 1-ATPase, the rota-\ntion rate is slowed to an observable level by increasing the\nhydrodynamic drag that it must oppose. However, the ro-\ntation is likely to be fundamentally at a constant angle per\nATP hydrolized, as shown by [11,12], and slowing the rota-\ntion by increasing drag results in some elastic storage of en -\nergy. Methods are needed that have the potential to observe\nhigh-frequencyrotationsandhaveless hydrodynamicdrag.\nThispaperpresentsamethodtomeasurehighfrequencyro-\ntationalmotion. An asymmetric\ufb02uorescentprobeis madeby\nattaching a small \ufb02uorescently labeled polymer microspher e\nto a larger polymer microsphere. The larger sphere acts as a\nlens, substantially enhancing the collection ef\ufb01ciency of the\noptical system. The experiment is outlined in the inset of\nFig.1.FIG. 1.

This gives an exit angle of 0.64\u03b8for\na ray entering at an angle \u03b8. Since the exit angle is always\nless than the original angle, we conclude that the lensing mi -\ncrosphere focuses rays from the \ufb02uorescent microsphere and\nenhancestheopticalsignal.\nThe enhancement in the observed optical signal also de-\npendson the numericalapertureof the objective. Thenumer-\nical aperture (NA) is de\ufb01ned as NA =nsin\u03b8o, where\u03b8ois\nthe collection angle. For our objective (20 \u00d7, 0.4 NA) in air\n\u03b8o= 23.6\u25e6. Equation(8)showsthatthefocusingmicrosphere\nincreases the angle of collection to 43.5\u25e6. This corresponds\nto an effective NA of 0.69. The epi-\ufb02uorescent intensity is\nproportional to NA4, so we expect an intensity enhancement\nof(0.69/0.4)4\u22489times; this is of the order of what we\nobserved. Objectives with high NA collect almost all of the\nemitted light, and thus we would not expect to see any \ufb02uo-\nrescentenhancementfromahighNA objective. Observations\nmade with a 40 \u00d7, 1.30NA oil immersion objective indicate\nnonoticeableintensityenhancement.\nTo construct this system we used the biotin/streptavidin\nbinding system. Biotin is known to bind streptavidin witha very high af\ufb01nity [13]. We obtained streptavidin coated\nmicrospheres from Interfacial Dynamics (polystyrene at a\nvolume concentration of 2.6%, 1.1 \u00b5m diameter) and biotin\ncoated yellow-green \ufb02uorescent microspheres (polystyren e\n1% by volume, 0.2 \u00b5m diameter, excitation maximum at\n505nm, emmission maximum at 515nm) from Molecular\nProbes. The smaller microspheres were diluted by a factor\nof 1000 in distilled water. A volume of 10 \u00b5l of this solution\nwas added to 10 \u00b5l of the large microspheres and allowed to\nincubateat roomtemperatureforapproximately\ufb01veminutes .\nThe solutionwas then dilutedby a factor of 104in either dis-\ntilledwateroraglycerol/watermixturetogivea\ufb01nalconce n-\ntrationofapproximatelyonemicrospherepairpernanolite rat\nthreedifferentviscosities(1cP,4cP, and13cP).\nFIG. 2.

The progress in the mod ern biotechnology\nis often impeded by the inability to solve a few fundamental theoretic al problems among\nwhich there is one grand challenge \u2014 given the primary sequence of ma cromolecule\n\ufb01nd its conformational structure at a given equilibrium, steady, or more interestingly,\nnonequilibrium state. The next part of the puzzle would be to \ufb01nd the relation between\nthe conformational structure and biofunctionality of say a prote in, but this sometimes\ncan be explained by location of certain active sites on the surface of a protein globule.\nThe computational di\ufb03culties are clearly immense for even not so long protein\nchain of just about 60 amino acid residues. Therefore at the momen t one hopes to\ndevelop merely some oversimpli\ufb01ed models of heteropolymers abstra cting from the ac-\ncurate molecular level description. Such models are obtained by coa rse\u2013graining in a\nfashion normal for statistical mechanics by integrating out many o f the local degrees\nof freedom. We hope to be able to deduce the mesostructure of a m acromolecule and\nto obtain many of the important observables. The approach that w e employ here is\nin its essence a nonequilibrium extension of the Gibbs\u2013Bogoliubov varia tional principle.\nThe main strength of the Gaussian self\u2013consistent (GSC) method, which we [3, 4, 5]\nand others [6] were developing \ufb01rst for the simple homopolymer and in Ref. [7] we have\nbrought to the most general form capable of describing copolymer s, is in that it produces\nthe complete set of mean squared distances between pairs of mono mers and thus the\nconformational structure.\nIn this work we do not concentrate on the formal derivation of the GSC equations.\nThis ispresentedin somedetailinRef. [7]. First, weshallintroduceac ruciallyimportant\nmodi\ufb01cationtothemodelitselfbyaddinganewso\u2013calledself\u2013interac tionterm. Weprove\nthat without this regularising term the theory is plagued with diverge nces if at least one\nsecond virial coe\ufb03cient is negative. We show that although the new t erm is seemingly\nnegligible for long chain lengths, and indeed is not required for the coil, it does in fact\nthe trick of correcting the structure of the dense globular state . In the rest of the work\nwe carry out extensive study of the equilibrium properties and the f olding kinetics for\na number of examples of heteropolymer sequences. We also discuss how the spin glass\nbehaviour arises for su\ufb03ciently random copolymer sequences.\n2. \u2013 The Model and the GSC Equations\nThe main variables in the coarse\u2013grained description of the polymer c hain [8, 9, 10]\nare the spatial monomer coordinates Xn, wherenis the monomer number. The solvent\nmolecules are excluded from the considerationby integratingout th eir degreesof freedom\nfrom the path integral representation for the partition function .

The \ufb01rst term in Eq. (1) describes the connectivity of\nthe chain with lcalled the statistical segment length. There are also volume interac tions\nrepresented by the virial\u2013type expansion [9, 10] in Eq. (1). They re \ufb02ect the hard\u2013core\nrepulsion, the weak attraction between monomers and the e\ufb00ectiv e interaction mediated\nby the solvent\u2013monomer couplings.\nSELF\u2013CONSISTENT TREATMENT OF COPOLYMERS WITH ARBITRARY SE QUENCES 3\nHere we consider the following choice of site\u2013dependent second viria l coe\ufb03cients in\nEq.

This corresponds to the case of amphiphilic heteropolymers,\nfor which monomers di\ufb00er only in the monomer\u2013solvent coupling const ants. The mean\nsecond virial coe\ufb03cient , \u00afu(2), is associated with the quality of the solvent and the pa-\nrameter \u2206 is called the degree of amphiphilicity of the chain. The set {\u03c3n}expresses\nthe chemical composition, or the primary sequence of a heteropolymer. Here we consider\nthe case when variables \u03c3ncan take only three values: \u22121,1 and 0 corresponding to\nhydrophobic \u2019 a\u2019, hydrophilic \u2019 b\u2019 and \u201cneutral\u201d \u2019 c\u2019 monomers respectively.\nIt is assumed that the long timescale evolution of the conformationa l state is well\nrepresented by the Langevin equation, which upon neglecting the h ydrodynamics may\nbe written as,\n\u03b6bd\ndtXn=\u2212\u2202H\n\u2202Xn+\u03b7n(t), (3)\nwhere\u03b6bis the \u201cbare\u201d friction constant per monomer and the Gaussian noise ,\u03b7n, is\ncharacterised by the second momentum,\n/an}bracketle{t\u03b7\u03b1\nn(t)\u03b7\u03b1\u2032\nn\u2032(t\u2032)/an}bracketri}ht= 2kBT\u03b6b\u03b4\u03b1,\u03b1\u2032\u03b4n,n\u2032\u03b4(t\u2212t\u2032), (4)\nwhere the Greek indices denote the spatial components of 3-d vec tors.\nThe main idea of the Gaussian self\u2013consistent method is to choose th e trial Hamil-\ntonian,H0, as a most generic quadratic form, with matrix coe\ufb03cients dependin g on\ntime,\nH0(t) =1\n2/summationdisplay\nnn\u2032Vnn\u2032(t)Xn(t)Xn\u2032(t).

(11), Esi, is somewhat more nontrivial. In\nfact, in the EFEF of the model (1) we have discarded terms with two or more coinciding\nindices in the three\u2013 and higher body contributions. These terms co me formally from the\nvirial\u2013type expansion, but each of them gives a singular contribution to the mean energy\n(11). It turns out, however, that upon suppressing these term s there appear additional\npathological solutions of the GSC equations with singular free energ y if at least one\nelement of the two\u2013body interaction matrix, u(2)\nmm\u2032, becomes negative. This is easy to\nsee. Indeed, consider volume interactions of just three monomer s under condition that\nthe mean squared distances from monomers \u20190\u2019 and \u20191\u2019 to \u20192\u2019 are equ al to each other,\nD0,2=D1,2=D. These interactions produce the mean energy contribution,\nE3=u(2)\n0,2+u(2)\n1,2\n(2\u03c0D)3/2+1\n(2\u03c0D0,1)3/2/parenleftbigg\nu(2)\n0,1+6u(3)(2\u03c0)\u22123/2\n(D\u2212D0,1/4)3/2/parenrightbigg\n(17)\nInthecasewhen u(2)\n0,1<0andmonomer\u20192\u2019isplacedawayfrommonomers\u20190\u2019and\u20191\u2019, D >\nD0,1/4+(6u(3)(2\u03c0)\u22123/2/|u(2)\n0,1|)2/3, obviously in the limit D0,1\u21920 the energy possesses\na singular minimum, E3\u2192 \u2212\u221e. As for the free energy, the logarithmic divergence of the\nentropy could not change the situation, thus A \u2192 \u2212\u221e as well. One can show that the\ninclusion of more monomers in the chain or of higher than three\u2013body interactions does\nnot improve the situation, but produces more and more of such pat hological solutions.\nThe reason we have not discussed this problem in our previous consid erations is that we\nhave accounted for the additional symmetry properties of monom er\u2013monomer distances,\nwhich come from the symmetry of the EFEF (1). For example, in the c ase of the ring\nhomopolymer, due to the inverse symmetry [5], we assumed that for any indices m,\nm\u2032the following mean squared distances are equal, Dm,m\u2032=Dm,2m\u2212m\u2032=D2m\u2032\u2212m,m\u2032.\nThis provides su\ufb03cient repulsion coming from three\u2013body term to pr eclude pathological\nsolutions.\nThus, in a more generalcase, where no symmetry propertiescould be assumed for an\narbitrary sequence, the standard procedure of suppressing te rms with coinciding indices\nis not satisfactory. Fortunately, it could be remedied by using anot her prescription \u2014\nreplacing the terms with coinciding indices by the so\u2013called self\u2013intera ction terms. Here\nwe propose the prescription for three\u2013body interaction which is su \ufb03cient for our current\npurposes,\nE(3)\nsi=c3u(3)/summationdisplay\nm/ne}ationslash=m\u2032/angbracketleftbigg\n\u03b4(Xm\u2212Xm\u2032)/angbracketrightbigg2\n=c3\u02c6u(3)/summationdisplay\nm/ne}ationslash=m\u2032D\u22123\nmm\u2032, (18)\nwherec3= 3 is a combinatorial factor related to the three possible ways of ha ving\ncoinciding pairs of indices in a triple summation. Obviously, the higher ne gative power\nofDmm\u2032in (18) compared to the two\u2013body term in (11) prevents one monom er from\nfalling on another.\nIt would be interesting to consider the coe\ufb03cient c3in Eq. (18) as an independent\nparameter and to discuss how the inclusion of this term would change the equilibrium\nand kinetics for the ring homopolymer [11]. Note that for the ring hom opolymer we can\nreduce the number of independent elements in the matrix of mean sq uared distances,\nDmm\u2032, by the factor of N, since due to the translational symmetry, Dm,m\u2032=Dm+k,m\u2032+k\n6 YU.A. KUZNETSOV , E.G. TIMOSHENKO\nfor anykandm,m\u2032. This symmetry allows us to reduce signi\ufb01cantly the computational\nrequirements.\nIn the good solvent regime, u(2)> u(3)>0, we \ufb01nd no substantial change caused by\nthe self\u2013interaction term (18). The deviations in the mean squared distances and in the\nsquared radius of gyration typically are less than 1% even for short chains. This is only\nnatural. In this regime this term is subdominant for long chains and ca n be neglected at\nall in the thermodynamic limit.\nHowever, the size and the structure of the homopolymer globule, w hich exists in the\nregionu(2)<0, can change signi\ufb01cantly. In Fig. 1 we exhibit the diagram of globular\nstates. One can see that actually two di\ufb00erent globular states are possible, which we\ncall the non\u2013compact globule (as one can see from Table I this globula r state possesses\na higher value of R2\ng) and the liquid\u2013like globule. The former is the thermodynamically\nstable state atcomparativelysmall c3, whilst the latter existsat highervalues of c3andin\nthe region of large u(2). For large negative u(2)the transition between two globular states\nbecomes discontinuous and the transition line goes nearly vertically a t approximately\nc3\u22481/2. However, the collapse transition from the extended polymer coil to the liquid\u2013\nlike globuleremainssecondorder. We found that this phase diagramis quite independent\nof the degree of polymerization, at least in the range we could study numerically, 30 \u2264\nN\u2264200. Thus, introducing of the term (18), which is subdominant for la rge values of\nNcompared to other terms in (11), nevertheless dramatically chang es the properties of\nthe globular state even for very long chains.\nNowletuscomparethestructureofthenon\u2013compactandtheliquid \u2013likeglobules. In\nFig. 2intheleft\u2013handsidewepresentthemeansquareddistances, whicharesymmetrical\nwith respect to the line m=N/2, i.e.D0,|m\u2212m\u2032|=D0,N\u2212|m\u2212m\u2032|, for values of c3= 0,3.\nIn the right\u2013hand side of the \ufb01gure we draw the same quantity obta ined from Monte\nCarlo simulations for a ring chain of hard spheres with the Lennard\u2013J ones attraction\n[15]. Since the parameters of excluded volume interactions in the mod el used for Monte\nCarlo simulations are expressed in di\ufb00erent terms, only shape and sc aling behaviour, but\nnot the absolute values of each Dmm\u2032, should be compared. We see a quite remarkable\nagreement here. This is a strong argument in favour of the liquid\u2013like globule. Its mean\nsquared distances have a typical saturation regime after compar atively small m. This is\nknown to be true of the globule from Monte Carlo simulations and prev ious results from\nother methods [12]. The function, D0mfor the non\u2013compact globule has much more\nconvex shape which, in fact, re\ufb02ects the e\ufb00ective monomer repuls ion on large distances\n(see Eq. (17). Also, from Table I we can see that the asymptotic sc aling in the degree\nof polymerisation for the size of the liquid\u2013like globule, R2\ng\u223cN2/3, is reached starting\nfrom su\ufb03ciently small Nin agreement with lattice Monte Carlo simulations [13], whilst\nfrom much larger Nfor the non\u2013compact globule [4].\nNow, let us turn our attention to the kinetics at the collapse transit ion, after an\ninstantaneous change of the value of the second virial coe\ufb03cient f rom a positive to a\nnegative value, the latter corresponding to the globular equilibrium s tate. In Fig. 3 we\nexhibit the evolution of the mean squared radii of gyration after qu enches to the liquid\u2013\nlike and the non\u2013compact globule. We found that the early stage pro ceeds in a similar\nmanner, while the middle or \u201ccoarsening\u201d kinetic stage is somewhat slo wer for quenches\nto the liquid\u2013like globule, but the \ufb01nal stages here are much faster. This can be seen\nfrom Tab. I, where we present the values of the total collapse time [14] and the \ufb01nal\nrelaxationtime, \u03c4ffordi\ufb00erent sizes, N. The moststrikingthing hereis thatthe e\ufb00ective\nexponent of the \ufb01nal relaxationtime is much smaller than what we hav e earlier expected,\n\u03b3f= 5/3 (see Ref. [3, 4]). This also shifts down the e\ufb00ective exponent of th e \u201ctotal\u201d\nSELF\u2013CONSISTENT TREATMENT OF COPOLYMERS WITH ARBITRARY SE QUENCES 7\ncollapse time, since the latter is a cross\u2013over between the exponen t of the coarsening\nstage,\u03b3m= 2, which is una\ufb00ected by the self\u2013interaction term, and the expon ent of\nthe \ufb01nal relaxation, \u03b3f. In principle, the \ufb01nal relaxation time and its exponent in the\ndegree of polymerization can be determined without appealing to num erical solution of\nthe kinetic GSC equations. From Ref. [3] we have, \u03c4f\u223cNF1, whereF1is the \ufb01rst\nnormal mode for the \ufb01nal equilibrium globular state,\nFq=\u22121\n2N/summationdisplay\nmcos2\u03c0qm\nND0m. (19)\nA good approximation for the function D0min the liquid\u2013like globule would be the\nfollowing D0mis linearly increasing function of muntil some value D0m1=D, where the\nN-dependence is, D\u223cm1\u223cN2/3and then it remains constant. This approximation\ncan also be obtained from the Lifshitz theory [12]. Now one can see th atF1\u223cN1/3and,\ncorrespondingly, \u03b3f= 4/3, which is close to the value of the e\ufb00ective exponent in Tab. I.\nThus, on the contrary to the coil state, for the liquid\u2013like globule th e \ufb01rst normal mode,\nF1, neither gives the main contribution to the mean squared radius of g yration, nor even\nhas the same scaling law in the degree of polymerization, N.\nInclusionoftheself\u2013interactionterm(18)alsostronglya\ufb00ectsth ephasediagramand\nkinetic properties of rigid chains. We shall consider these questions in a separate work\n[15]. Such modi\ufb01cations are rather welcome and allows one to make the GSC method\nmore accurate for the dense globular states, where its validity has been less established.\n4. \u2013 Equilibrium Properties of Copolymer Sequences\nThe GSC equations (10) have been studied numerically using the \ufb01fth order Runge\u2013\nKutta algorithm with adaptive time step [16]. In fact, for copolymer s equences, consid-\nered in the current work, the time step during numerical integratio ns of Eqs. (10) varies\napproximately 100 times. Thus, any integration scheme with \ufb01xed tim e step is rather\nunreliable here.\nIn studying the equilibrium we consider only stationary points of Eqs. (10), i.e. the\nlimitt\u2192 \u221e. If for some set of interaction parameters, \u00af u(2)and \u2206, one obtains several\nstationary states, one should compare the values of the variation al free energy, A. The\ndeepest minimum of the free energy corresponds to the thermody namically stable state,\nthe rest of the solutions to metastable states. Here we consider c opolymers with the ring\ntopology, though the current treatment may be easily extended f or study of copolymers\nwith any other topology just by changing the spring term in Eqs. (1, 11).\nTypical phase diagrams in terms of the mean second virial coe\ufb03cient , \u00afu(2), and the\namphiphilicity, \u2206, in Eq. (2) for some \u201crandom\u201d and periodic sequence s are presented\nin Figs. 4-6. In the region \u00af u(2)>0 and for small values of amphiphilicity, \u2206 <5, typical\nconformations of copolymers are akin to the homopolymer extende d coil. By decreasing\n\u00afu(2)to the negative region the chain undergoes the continuous collapse transition, simi-\nlarly to what we observed in Sec. 3. The collapse transition is characterised by a rapid\nfall of the radius of gyration, R2\ng, (15) and the change of the fractal dimension, \u03bd(see\nTab. I).\nThe collapse transition for larger values of amphiphilicity turns out to be more com-\nplicated, and essentiallydependent onthe sequence. The globulars tate forlargevaluesof\n\u2206 is di\ufb00erent from the liquid\u2013like globule. It is characterized by somewh at higher value\nofthe radiusofgyrationandextremely largevalue ofthe MPS order parameter(16), thus\n8 YU.A. KUZNETSOV , E.G. TIMOSHENKO\nwe call this state the MPS globule. The MPS globule is separated from t he liquid\u2013like\none by a weak continuous transition (see Figs. 4-6). In the case of long blocks (Fig. 6)\nthe collapse transition to the MPS globule becomes discontinuous (\ufb01r st\u2013order\u2013like). The\nspinodals I\u2019 and I\u201d designate the region where two distinct states c orresponding to the\ncoil and the MPS globule can be found. The depths of the free energ y minima become\nexactly equal on the transition curve I in Fig. 6.\nHowever, for a wide class of sequences, for example for aperiodic s equences in Figs.\n4, 5, the phase diagram at large amphiphilicity, \u2206, is much more complica ted. Starting\nfromsomevalueof\u2206insomeintermediateregionof \u00af u(2)thereappearadditionalsolutions\ncorresponding to local minima of the free energy. The broad region where this could take\nplace is bounded by the curves I\u2019 and II\u201d in Figs. 4, 5. With increasing \u2206 the number of\nsuch solutions grows quickly. Signi\ufb01cantly, in the region of the phase diagram, between\ncurves I and II in Figs. 4, 5, some of these possess the lowest free energy value, thus\nbeing the thermodynamically stable state. Since the number of such solutions is rather\nhigh even for short sequences and their number grows quickly with t he chain length,\nwe do not attempt to draw all their boundaries of (meta)stability. W e shall call them\ncollectively as frustrated phases , explaining this terminology below.\nNow let us compare the phase diagrams in Figs. 4 and 5, the latter cor responding\nto the sequence twice longer than the for former. An interesting o bservation is that\nthe region between spinodals I\u2019 and II\u201d, designating where the fru strated phases can\nexist, expands dramatically with increasing chain length. The same co ncerns the region\nof thermodynamically stable frustrated phases between curves I and II. More exactly,\nthese regions expand downwards and to the left, so that the posit ion of curves I\u2019 and I\nchange slightly with increasing N, whilst curves II and II\u201d depend signi\ufb01cantly on the\nsize of the system. For rather long chains we may expect that the r egions of stability\nand metastability of the frustrated phases will continue to expand downwards and to\nthe left, so that the lines II and II\u201d will become nearly vertical, displa cing the region of\nstable MPS globule. Probably, for most of long heteropolymer chains the MPS globule\ndoes not exist as thermodynamically stable state, becoming stable o nly for some special\nsequences. Unfortunately, we can not proceed with numerical so lution for much larger\nsystem sizes, N, since the calculational expenses grow in NasN3per iteration and also\nthe total number of frustrated states becomes huge for large s ystem sizes. This diversity\nand a special foliating structure of various branches leads in the th ermodynamic limit to\nwhat is known as a spin glass frozen phase [17] of random copolymers .\nLet us consider the conformational structure of the frustrate d states for the copoly-\nmer consisting of repeating \u2019 ab\u2019 blocks. The phase diagram of this sequence also exhibits\nthe thermodynamically stable frustrated phases [7] starting from approximately N= 28.\nIn Figs. 7 and 8 we present the dependence of the observables in (1 5, 16) at a quasistatic\nchange of the mean second virial coe\ufb03cient, \u00af u(2), from the coil state to the MPS globule\nand back. From these pictures one can see in the intermediate regio n only a few (seven\nto be precise) of all possible frustrated phases. The values of the radius of gyration and\nthe MPS order parameter are intermediate for these solutions, lyin g between those of\nthe coil and the MPS globule. In this sense, we can call them non\u2013fully compacted and\nmisfolded states.\nIn the series of pictures in Fig. 9 we present the matrix of mean squa red distances,\nDmm\u2032, for the copolymer, consisting of \u2019 ab\u2019 blocks at some values of the mean second\nvirial coe\ufb03cient, \u00af u(2). The set of Dmm\u2032in the GSC method completely determines the\nconformational structure of any, equilibrium or kinetic, state. Fo r positive \u00af u(2)(see\nFig. 9a) the mean squared distances possess the structure typic al for the extended coil.\nSELF\u2013CONSISTENT TREATMENT OF COPOLYMERS WITH ARBITRARY SE QUENCES 9\nThe elements of the matrix, Dmm\u2032, increase monotonically on moving away from its\ndiagonals towards the distance of half\u2013ring along the chain. Thus, t heDmm\u2032matrix\nmay be approximated here by a monotonically increasing function of t he chain distance,\n|m\u2212m\u2032|. Decreasing the mean second virial coe\ufb03cient, \u00af u(2), causes the copolymer to\npass through frustrated states, in Figs. 9b-9d, \ufb01nally reachingt he MPS globule state (see\nFig. 9e). The characteristic feature of the Dmm\u2032matrix in a frustrated state is that it\npossesses some number of monomer groups having smaller distance s between each other\nthan between monomers from other groups. Clearly, such a group represents a cluster\nof monomers, so that here the copolymer chain forms a set of clust ers (approximately\n8 clusters in Fig. 9b, 4 clusters in Fig. 9c and 2 clusters in Fig. 9d), eac h consisting of\nmonomers nearest along the chain.\nThe internal structure of each cluster is similar to the structure o f the \ufb01nal MPS\nglobule. Forthesimplestcopolymersequencepresentedhere, the Dmm\u2032matrixawayfrom\nthe diagonal can be divided into sub\u2013matrices of the size 2 \u00d72 (see top of the Fig. 9e),\neach of which possesses approximately the same structure: small values in the upper\nleft corner correspond to the mean squared distances between h ydrophobic monomers;\nlarge values in the lower right corner, which are the mean squared dis tances between\nhydrophilic monomers; and o\ufb00-diagonal elements are nearly equal a nd correspond to\nthe distances between di\ufb00erent species. Thus, for the MPS globule , such structure of the\nDmm\u2032matrix re\ufb02ects the structure ofthe two\u2013bodyinteraction matrix ,u(2)\nmm\u2032. Obviously,\nthe higher correlation between these two matrices is manifested in t he higher value of\nthe MPS order parameter. For another, more complicated, seque nces the Dmm\u2032matrix\nin the MPS globular state has a di\ufb00erent structure, but still it resem bles in some way\nthe interaction matrix, u(2)\nmm\u2032away from the diagonal, being distorted by the spring\ninteractions in the elements close to the diagonal. Note that for the liquid\u2013like globule\nthe pattern of the Dmm\u2032matrix looks su\ufb03ciently trivial. Namely, it has narrow band of\ndark color along the main diagonal with its intensity quickly decreasing , as one can see\nfrom Fig. 9f.\nFromFig.9onecanseethattheinteractionsymmetriesimposedbyt heEFEF(1)are\nspontaneously broken in the region of the phase diagram correspo nding to the frustrated\nphases. Obviously, in our case the number of possible ways to break the symmetry\nis enormously huge and moreover it grows exponentially with increasin g system size.\nDespite thekinematicsymmetriesarenotpresentforarbitraryse quences, thestructureof\nthe phase diagram(see Figs. 4, 5) and behaviourof main observable sremain verysimilar.\nIt is the particular structure of Dmm\u2032matrix, number and the shape of boundaries of\nfrustrated phases that are quite sensitive to the sequence. The symmetry that may\nbe broken in this case has a subtler meaning and may be expressed in t erms of the\nreplica formalism [17]. Consider, for example, two nearly identical bloc ks with nearly\nidentical surroundings. In the coil and the MPS globular states one should expect the\nconformationalmatricesoftheseblockstobe nearlyequaltoeac hother. Onthecontrary,\nthe small di\ufb00erence in the interactions in the region of frustrated p hases may lead to a\nhuge di\ufb00erence in the conformations. Thus, it is by no means surpris ing that the replica\nsymmetry breaking in the case of periodic systems takes such an ex plicit manifestation\nin the breaking of the block translational symmetry.\nAn important point here is that the frustrated phases become dom inant in an inter-\nmediate region of the phase diagram not due to a low mean energy, bu t mostly due to a\nhigher entropy. The MPS globule is entropically unfavourable there b ecause the overall\nshrinking force is insu\ufb03ciently strong. Also, in the regime of nearly co mpensating repul-\n10 YU.A. KUZNETSOV , E.G. TIMOSHENKO\nsion and attraction between monomers it is more preferable to achie ve phase separation\non a smaller, than the globular, scale by forming clusters.\n5. \u2013 Folding Kinetics\nHere we shall consider the time evolution of the conformational sta te of a copoly-\nmer away from the initial equilibrium after it has been subjected to an instantaneous\ntemperature jump that causes the two\u2013body interaction parame ters in Eq. (2), \u00af u(2)and\n\u2206, to change. The composition of copolymer {\u03c3}and the rest of parameters remain\nthe same and do not change with time. We are interested in quenches from the ho-\nmopolymer coil, where all monomers are equally hydrophilic (\u00af u(2)>0 and \u2206 = 0), to\nthe region of parameters corresponding to the MPS globular state , so that the \u2018 a\u2019 species\nbecame strongly hydrophobic and the \u2018 b\u2019 species remained nearly neutral (\u00af u(2)\u226a0\nand \u2206\u2248 |\u00afu(2)|). Here we consider some binary copolymer systems, consisting of t he\nsame number of \u2019 a\u2019 and \u2019b\u2019 monomers and of the same size, N= 50, and quench,\n(\u00afu(2)= 15,\u2206 = 0)\u2192(\u00afu(2)=\u221235,\u2206 = 30).\nLet us \ufb01rst discuss the general features of the kinetics of the co polymer folding. The\ntime evolution of the mean squared radius of gyration, R2\ng(t), the MPS order parameter,\n\u03a8(t), and the instantaneous free energy, A(t), is presented in Figs. 10, 11. Here lines\nA correspond to the homopolymer and serve for reference purpo uses. In the case of\nthe homopolymer one can see that R2\ngandAdecrease monotonically to their equilibrium\nvalues correspondingto the liquid\u2013like globule state, while \u03a8remains ide ntically zero. As\nfor the copolymer kinetics, the \ufb01rst observation consists in that it proceeds much slower\nthan for the homopolymer. For example, for the simplest copolymer sequence, \u2019( ba)25\u2019,\nthe total collapse time [14] is more than 3 times longer than that of th e homopolymer,\nother copolymer sequences collapsing even longer. The total collap se time also seems to\nbe quite sensitive to the copolymer sequence. Since the micro\u2013phas e separation is one\nof the main factors in collapse of copolymers, the MPS order parame ter, \u03a8, grows in\nkinetics most of the time for all considered sequences, though rat her nonmonotonically.\nNevertheless, for some sequences it might be negative during some time in kinetics (see\ne.g. sequences E and F in Fig. 11b), something we never observed at equilibrium.\nThe evolution of the instantaneous free energy, A(t), depicted in Figs. 10c, 11c, is\nmost unusual. Typically it proceeds through multiple accelerations an d decelerations.\nThe \ufb02at regions of a staircase\u2013like function correspond to tempor ary kinetic arrest of the\nsystem in transient nonequilibrium conformations, i.e. to transient t rappings of various\nmembers of the ensemble in their local shallow energy minima. Since suc h minima are\nencountered at di\ufb00erent moments in time for di\ufb00erent members of t he ensemble, their\nin\ufb02uence on the overall time evolution of averaged observables is ma nifested in a smooth\ncharacteristicslowingdown. Noteherethatthenumberofstepsin kineticsprocesshardly\ncan be guessed from the given primary sequence. Typically, the kine tics for sequences\nwith smaller number of blocks proceeds through smaller number of st eps. For example,\nfolding of the periodic sequence consisting of long blocks, \u2019( b5a5)5(see line E in Fig. 11c),\nproceeds through only one, though rather long, kinetically arrest ed step. However, for\nthe aperiodic sequence of long blocks (line F in Fig. 11c) we can see at le ast six such\nsteps, the third one being the longest in time.\nNow let us consider the nonequilibrium conformations, given by the ma trix of the\nmean squared distances between monomers, Dmm\u2032. In Fig. 12 we exhibit the Dmm\u2032ma-\ntrix for \u2019( ba)25\u2019 sequence at di\ufb00erent times in the folding kinetics. We can see that k inetic\nprocess proceeds through formation of locally collapsed and phase \u2013separated clusters.\nSELF\u2013CONSISTENT TREATMENT OF COPOLYMERS WITH ARBITRARY SE QUENCES 11\nThe initial conformation is similar to Fig. 9a, then at time t= 3.6 we can see approx-\nimately 10 clusters (Fig. 12a), at time t= 5.75 \u2014 6 clusters (Fig. 12b) and at t= 8.6\n\u2014 4 clusters (Fig. 12c). During later evolution these four clusters a pproach each other\nsince, as one can see from Fig. 12d, the inter\u2013cluster distances ar e much smaller than\nin Fig. 12c. Finally, the clusters unify forming the MPS globule, the Dmm\u2032matrix of\nwhich is quite similar to that presented in Fig. 9e. We should note here a lso that these\nnonequilibrium states do not possess the translational block symme try, present for the\nsystem in the EFEF and the initial conditions. After some time in kinetic s,t\u22481 this\nsymmetry breaks down, and restores only during \ufb01nal kinetic stag es at time moment\nt\u224815.\nHowever, the formal structure of the GSC kinetic equations (10) is such that they\nyield a symmetric solution at any moment in time if one proceeds from th e symmetric\ninitial condition. What we observe here is a spontaneous symmetry b reaking in kinetics.\nNamely, at some moment in time the symmetric solution of the kinetic eq uations be-\ncomes unstable with respect to perturbations, whether of the init ial condition, or of the\ninteraction matrix, u(2)\nnn\u2032. In the exact theory there are \ufb02uctuations that can transform\nbetween di\ufb00erent spontaneously broken states in kinetics, thus d estroying the unstable\nsymmetric state. To describe such phenomena strictly in the frame work of the Gaussian\nmethod, which presents an improved, but still a mean\u2013\ufb01eld type of t heory, we should\ninclude explicitly an in\ufb01nitesimal symmetry breaking term \u03b5nn\u2032to the two\u2013body inter-\naction matrix, u(2)\nmm\u2032, and consider the limit of vanishing perturbation in the solution.\nIn fact, in numerical integration such a regularisation procedure is not even necessary,\nsince there is always an intrinsic perturbation due to computer roun d o\ufb00 and numerical\nintegration errors. Thus, if the symmetry is favourable to be kinet ically broken some-\nwhere, numerically one obtains some spontaneously broken solution s there, rather than\nthe unstable symmetric solution, unless the symmetry conditions ha ve been imposed by\nhand. In fact, adding a rather small perturbation matrix, \u03b5nn\u2032, changes the behaviour of\nthe global observables, such as R2\ng, \u03a8,Aand characteristic kinetic times rather insigni\ufb01-\ncantly. However, what can be changed by including of a perturbatio n is the centers along\nthe chain around which clusters form and grow.\nFinally, let us discuss how the folding kinetics depends on the sequenc e. In series of\npictures in Fig. 10 we present kinetic processes for the simplest cop olymer consisting of\n\u2019ab\u2019 blocks (sequence B), and also for some sequences obtained by ce rtain modi\ufb01cations\nin it. In the sequence denoted by C in Fig. 10 we have replaced ten sho rt blocks by\nfour of longer size. In the sequence D we have inserted only two hyd rophobic and two\nhydrophilic fragments into the sequence, i.e. we have made only two p ermutations. For\nthe former sequence the total kinetic time became approximately 1 .7 times longer than\nthatfortheBsequence. The\ufb01nalvaluesofthefreeenergyforb othsequencesBandCare\nnearly the same, whilst the micro\u2013phase separation is somewhat bet ter for the modi\ufb01ed\nsequence C, due to longer blocks. Thus, for that sequence the kin etic properties do not\ndeteriorate very much, except that kinetic process takes essen tially longer. However, the\nkinetic foldability of the D sequence is much more poor than for B and C sequences. In\nfact, here not only the kinetic process takes much longer, but the \ufb01nal state is di\ufb00erent\nfrom the MPS globule. As one can see from Fig. 13 the \ufb01nal kinetic sta te for the D\nsequence consists of two clusters. These clusters are connecte d by two links, formed by\nnearly neutral fragments, \u2019 b2\u2019. Further collapse of this conformation is unfavourable due\nto the entropy and partial screening of hydrophobic monomers by nearly neutral species\n\u2019b\u2019. Size of such misfolded state is larger and the MPS order parameter is approximately\n12 YU.A. KUZNETSOV , E.G. TIMOSHENKO\ntwice smaller than what we could expect for the MPS globule. As we hav e already seen\nkinetics of sequences consisting of longer blocks is also quite sensitiv e to the sequence.\nSome modi\ufb01cations of the periodic sequence E in Fig. 11 to form aperio dic long blocks\nsequence, F, result in somewhat longer, but much more complicated , kinetic processes.\n6. \u2013 Conclusion\nIn this paper we applied the extended GSC method to studying the eq uilibrium and\nkinetic phenomena of some particular amphiphilic heteropolymer sequ ences. First, we\nhave revised the Gaussian theory to include the self\u2013interaction te rm (18). Thus, the\ntwo\u2013body term in our formalism describes the e\ufb00ective interactions between monomers,\nthe self\u2013interaction term is responsible for stability of the globular s tate, and the three\u2013\nbody interactions between distinct monomers provide the correct scaling of the size of\nthe globule. The structure of the homopolymer globule is now in bette r agreement with\nthe one obtained from other methods. We have found that the kine tic laws of the ring\nhomopolymerdo not changesigni\ufb01cantlydue to introduction ofthe s elf\u2013interactionterm,\nexcept for the \ufb01nal relaxation time, which without hydrodynamic int eraction scales with\nthe degree of polymerization as, \u03c4f\u223cN4/3.\nWe have obtained typical phase diagrams for heteropolymers cons isting of short and\nlong blocks. For sequences with rather frustrated interactions a long the chain, apart\nfrom the coil, the liquid\u2013like and the micro\u2013phase separated globular s tates, we have\ndiscovered that in a wide intermediate region of the phase diagram th ere may be a large\nnumber offrustratedpartiallymisfolded states. Someofsuch sta tes, the number ofwhich\ngrows exponentially with the chain length, become the dominant ther modynamic state\nin rather narrow domains. We may conclude that the transition to th ese states for large\nsystems corresponds to a glassy freezing transition.\nFor large amphiphilicity parameter collapse from the extended coil st ate to the MPS\nglobule for a wide class of sequences proceeds at equilibrium through these frustrated\nphases. Atypicalcopolymerconformationhereis asetofmicro\u2013ph aseseparatedclusters.\nOn approaching the MPS globule quasistatically the number of cluster s decreases, reach-\ning only one cluster in the \ufb01nal MPS globular state. A typical cluster s ize is determined\nby some characteristic range where the micro\u2013phase separation m ay occur.\nWe have discovered that the region of meta\u2013 and thermodynamic st ability of the\nfrustrated phases expands with system size displacing the region o f the MPS globule.\nIt is quite likely that the thermodynamically stable MPS globule for hete ropolymers\nof several hundreds of monomers is possible only for a narrow class of some special\nsequences. Also it is likely that inclusion of other interactions, such a s electrostatic,\nand thus modi\ufb01cation of the two\u2013body interaction matrix in Eq. (2), may additionally\nstabilise the MPS globule.\nWe \ufb01nd that the kinetics of folding from the coil to the MPS globule for copolymers\ntakes much longer than for the homopolymer since it is strongly a\ufb00ec ted by the presence\nof the transient frustrated states along the kinetic pathway. Th is leads to a complicated\nkinetic process consisting of multiple steps with pronounced slowing d own and then\nacceleration in the folding rate. We also present here some preliminar y studies on how\nthe folding kinetics depends on the primary heteropolymer sequenc e. Typically, the\nkinetics for copolymers consisting of long blocks proceeds in a smaller number of steps,\nbut not necessarily faster, than kinetics for short block copolyme rs. For the latter we\nhave seen that even small modi\ufb01cations of the sequence may chang e crucially the overall\nkinetic behaviour and even the \ufb01nal kinetic state itself.\nSELF\u2013CONSISTENT TREATMENT OF COPOLYMERS WITH ARBITRARY SE QUENCES 13\nThere is an interesting arena here for classi\ufb01cation of sequences a nd conformational\nstates. Moving in this direction would allow to develop better models fo r proteins, which\nsequences have been specially optimised by the biological evolution.\nFinally, we hope that the way is now open for constructing the non\u2013G aussian exten-\nsion to the self\u2013consistent method. This is di\ufb03cult since the closure r elations for higher\u2013\norder correlation functions are nontrivial for polymers. When tha t is accomplished one\ncould speak of real predictive accuracy of the method.\n\u2217 \u2217 \u2217\nThe authors acknowledge interesting discussions with Professor A .Yu.

In this paper we pro-\npose a simple and robust model for the kinesin\nstepping process with elastically coupled Brow-\nnian heads showing all of these properties. The\nanalytic and numerical treatment of our modelre-\nsults in a very good \ufb01t to the experimental data\nand practically has no free parameters. Chang-\ning the values of the parameters in the restricted\nrange allowed by the related experimental esti-\nmates has almost no e\ufb00ect on the shape of the\ncurves and results mainly in a variation of the\nzero load velocity which can be directly \ufb01tted to\nthe measured data. In addition, the model is con-\nsistent with the measured pathway of the kinesin\nATPase.\nKinesin is a motor protein converting the energy of ATP\nhydrolysis into mechanical work while moving large dis-\ntances along microtubule \ufb01laments and transporting or-\nganelles and vesicles inside the cytoplasm of eukaryotic\ncells [1]. The wall of a microtubule is made up of tubu-\nlin heterodimers arranged in 13 longitudinal rows called\nproto\ufb01laments (Fig. 1). A tubulin heterodimer is 8 nm\nlong and consists of two globular proteins about 4 nm in\ndiameter: \u03b1- and\u03b2-tubulin. The dimers bind head-to-\ntail giving the polarity to the proto\ufb01laments. The mi-\ncrotubule has a helical surface lattice which can have\ntwo possible con\ufb01gurations: the adjacent proto\ufb01laments\ncan be shifted in the longitudinal direction by about\neither 5 nm (A-type lattice) or 1 nm (B-type lattice).\nElectron micrograph measurements of microtubules dec-\noratedwithkinesinheadfragments[2\u20135]indicatethepre-\ndominance of the B-type lattice and show that kinesin\nheads can bind only to the \u03b2-tubulin (meanwhile weakly\ninteracting with the \u03b1-tubulin also). Native kinesin is a\ndimeric molecule with two globular( \u223c9\u00d73\u00d73nm) heads.\nEach one has an ATP and a tubulin binding site.\nRecent experimental studies in in vitromotility assays\nhave revealed the following properties of kinesin move-\nment:\n\u2022kinesin moves unidirectionally parallel to the\nproto\ufb01laments towards the \u201c(+)\u201d end of the mi-\ncrotubule [6,7];\u2022under an increasing load the speed of the kinesin\ndecreases almost linearly [8,9] (see Fig. 3);\n\u2022under its stall force (about 5 pN) kinesin still con-\nsumes ATP at an elevated rate [9];\n\u2022in the absence of ATP (in rigor state) kinesin binds\nto the microtubule verystrongly: it supports forces\nin excess of 10 pN [9];\n\u2022the observed step size in the low speed regime (at\nlow ATP or at high force) is about 8 nm [10];\n\u2022some backward slippage was clearly observed [9];\n\u2022thedisplacementvarianceatsaturatingATPandat\nlow load increases linearly with time, but at (only\nsomewhat more than) half of the rate of a single\nPoisson stepping process with 8 nm step size, im-\nplying that one step consists of two sequential sub-\nprocesses with comparable limiting rates [11].\nPartially motivated by these remarkable experimental\nadvances several interesting thermal ratchet type mod-\nels have very recently been developed for the theoreti-\ncal interpretation of the related transport phenomena.\nThese models [13\u201320] except that of Ajdari (Ref. [21])\nconsider cases in which the internal degree of freedom\nof the molecular motors is not taken into account. The\npurpose of the present work is to de\ufb01ne and investigate\na dynamic model for the kinesin walk which has an in-\nternal degree of freedom and results in a full agreement\nwith the experimental data for the range of its param-\neters allowed by the known estimates for the lower and\nupper bounds of these parameters.\nThere are two basic classes of possible models for the\nstepping of kinesin [12]. The \ufb01rst one is the \u201cLong-\nStride\u201d model in which the heads are moving along a\nsingle proto\ufb01lament. The two heads are displaced from\neach other by 8 nm. During the stepping process the\nback head passes the bound front head advancing 16 nm.\nThen the heads change their roles and a new step may\ntake place. However, within this framework during the\nlong stride the back head has a good chance to bind to\na\u03b2site belonging to a neighboring track which is closer\nthan the next \u03b2site in the same track. Another problem\nis that the low displacement variance observed experi-\nmentally cannot be naturally explained. This model was\nstudied in detail by Peskin and Oster [22], who by intro-\nducing several reaction rate constants found a reasonable\nagreement with the experimental results.\n1\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\u03b1\n\u03b2\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\u03b1\n\u03b2\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\u03b1\n\u03b2\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\u03b1\n\u03b2\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\u03b1\n\u03b2\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\u03b1\n\u03b2\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\u03b1\n\u03b2\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\u03b1\n\u03b2\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\u03b1\n\u03b2\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\u03b1\n\u03b2\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\u03b1\n\u03b2\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\n~1 nm~8 nm(+) End\n(-) End\nFIG. 1. The structure of the B-type helical surface lattice\nof the microtubule. The kinesin heads can bind only to the\n\u03b2-tubulin monomers.\nThe other possibility is the family of \u201cTwo-Step\u201d mod-\nels. These models naturally explain the low displace-\nmentvariancebecauseofthetwosequentialsubprocesses.\nDuring one cycle one of the two heads takes a 8 nm step\n\ufb01rst then the other head steps. Note that the motion\nof just one head advances the centroid of the molecule\nby only 4 nm the successive steps of the two heads in\nrapid pair results in an e\ufb00ective 8 nm step which can be\nobserved in the low speed regime. This kind of motion\ngives large stability to the proto\ufb01lament tracking. The\ndi\ufb00erences in the \u201cTwo-Step\u201d models arise from the rela-\ntive positions of the heads. If both heads track the same\nproto\ufb01lament they are not able to pass each other, so\nwe can always distinguish the front and the back head.\nIn this case the distance of the heads alternates between\n8 and 16 nm, which seems a bit large for the kinesin\nmolecule with its 9 \u221210 nm long heads, but is still possi-\nble. (Alternating between 0 and 8 nm is already impossi-\nble because only one head can bind to each \u03b2-tubulin site\nat a time). Another quite reasonable situation is when\nthetwo heads track adjacent proto\ufb01laments on a B-type\nlattice. In this case the heads are sitting on adjacent \u03b2-\ntubulins displaced from each other by only about 1 nm in\nthe longitudinal direction, thus either can take the \ufb01rst\nstep (they can be identical).\nDYNAMICS OF THE KINESIN WALK\nWe present here a one-dimensional kinesin walk model\nwhich describes the whole family of \u201cTwo-Step\u201d models.\nEach of the two Brownian heads can move along its own\none-dimensionalperiodic potential with period L= 8 nm\nin an overdamped environment. The two potentials canbe shifted relatively to each other by an arbitrary dis-\ntance (or even can be the same). These potentials rep-\nresent the interaction with the proto\ufb01laments and the\nperiods are the tubulin heterodimers. Each period has a\ndeep potential valley corresponding to the binding site\nof the\u03b2-tubulin and the other parts of the potential\nare \ufb02at. Each valley has an asymmetric \u201cV\u201d shape (see\nFig. 2): the slope in the backward direction (towards the\n\u201c(\u2212)\u201d end of the microtubule) is steeper and 0 .5\u22121 nm\nlong, while the other slope (towards the \u201c(+)\u201d end) is\n1.5\u22122 nm long, showing the polarity of the \ufb01laments.\nThese ranges are in the order of the Debye length.\nFF (b)\nQ Q\nL = 8 nm L = 8 nm(a)\nFIG. 2. Schematic picture of the potential and the sub-\nsequent steps (from top to bottom) of the kinesin molecule\nin the two limiting cases. In the case (a) the hinge is always\nin the centroid of the molecule, and advances 4 \u22124 nm dur-\ning both subprocesses. The two heads share the load force\nequally. In the case (b) the relative position of the hinge to\nthe back head is \ufb01xed, thus the whole load force acts on this\nhead. During the \ufb01rst subprocess the hinge does not move,\nhowever, during the second it advances 8 nm. All the inter-\nmediate cases are possible between (a) and (b).\nIn our model the heads are connected at a hinge, and\naspring acts between them (Fig. 2). At the beginning of\nthe mechanochemicalcycle both headsaresitting in their\nvalleyswaitingforanATPmolecule, andthespringisun-\nstrained. Any con\ufb01guration of the model is mathemati-\ncally equivalent to a model in which the two potentials\nareidentical, the heads aresitting in the same valley, and\ntherefore the rest length of the spring is zero. (Further\non we will consider only this version of the model.) After\none of the heads binds an ATP molecule, the hydrolysis\nof this ATP causes a conformational change in this head,\n2\nmore precisely, induces the head to take a 8 nm forward\nstep. In the language of the model it means that the\nrest length of the spring changes from zero to 8 nm right\nafter the hydrolysis. Then, as the \ufb01rst rate-limiting sub-\nprocess, the strained spring is trying to stretch pushing\nthe head to the next valley. Reaching its new 8 nm rest\nlength another conformational change occurs in the head\nas a consequence of the ADP release: the rest length\nof the spring changes back to zero quickly, then, as the\nsecond rate-limiting subprocess, the spring is trying to\ncontract pulling forward the other head. Completing\nthe contraction a next cycle can start waiting for a new\nATP molecule. Hirose et al.[5] provide evidence that the\nkinesin\u00b7ADPcomplexhasindeedadi\ufb00erentconformation\nnear the junction of the heads. (Similarly, a myosin head\nalso gets over several conformational changes [23,24].)\nAn important cooperative feature of our model is that\nonly one ATP hydrolysis can occur during each cycle.\nThis picture is consistent with the scheme of Gilbert\net al.[25] for the pathway of the kinesin ATPase. The\n\ufb01rst rate-limiting subprocess was observed as the disso-\nciation of the head from the microtubule followed by a\nfast rebinding. They did not report on the second one,\nbut it is clear that this subprocess already does not be-\nlong to the chemical part of the cycle, and induces a slow\ndissociation and a fast rebinding of the other head.\nWe can take the load force into account in a natural\nway. Since in the experiments of Svoboda et al.[9,10]\na large (\u223c0.5\u00b5m in diameter) and therefore slow (com-\npared to the kinesin heads) silica bead was linked to the\nhinge of the kinesin molecule by a relatively weak elastic\ntether, we can apply a constant (independent of time)\nforceFto the hinge. We arrive at the same conclusion\nby considering the experiments of Hunt et al.[8], where\na viscous load acted on the moving microtubule while\nthe long tail of the kinesin was \ufb01xed. But how can we\ntransfer the force to the heads when writing down the\nequations of their motion? There are two possible lim-\niting cases: if the hinge is always in the centroid of the\nmolecule (Fig. 2a) the two heads share the load force\nequally,i.e.,F/2 force acts on both heads; if the head\nwhich wants to step is always free from the load force\n(as in Fig. 2b) the whole force Facts on the actual back\nhead. Due to the robustness of the model both (and\ntherefore all the intermediate) cases yield practically the\nsame force-velocity curves (Fig. 3).\nThe motion of the heads are described by the Langevin\nequations\n\u0393\u02d9x1=\u2212\u2202xV(x1)\u2212Fload\n1+K\u00b7(x2\u2212x1\u2212l(t))+\u03be1(t),\n\u0393\u02d9x2=\u2212\u2202xV(x2)\u2212Fload\n2+K\u00b7(x1\u2212x2\u2212l(t))+\u03be2(t).\n(1)\nwherex1andx2denote the positions of the heads; \u0393\nis the frictional drag coe\ufb03cient; V(x) is the periodic\npotential; l(t) is the rest length (which alternates be-\ntween 0 and 8 nm due to the conformational changes)\nandKis the sti\ufb00ness of the spring; \u03be1(t),\u03be2(t) areGaussian white noises with the autocorrelation function/angbracketleftbig\n\u03bej(t)\u03bei(t\u2032)/angbracketrightbig\n= 2kT\u0393\u03b4j,i\u03b4(t\u2212t\u2032) fori,j= 1,2.\n02004006008001000\n0123456(a)\n020406080\n0123456Velocity  (nm/s)(b)\n0100200300400500600\n0123456\nLoad Force  (pN)(c)\nFIG. 3.

The circles and diamo nds\nin (a) mean two di\ufb00erent set of the measured data. To get\nthe best \ufb01t (solid lines) we chose 0.7 nm for the backward\nlength of the potential valleys and 1.75 nm for the forward\nlength; the depth of the valleys was Q= 20kT. In these plots\nthe load force was F/2 on each kinesin head. In plot (b) we\nmultiplied the average displacement by the ATP consumption\nrate\u03bd(cATP) = 10 1/s for the best \ufb01t. In plot (c) we used the\nsame curve as in (a) but multiplied by a factor 0.6, which can\nbe explained with the larger viscosity.\n3\nRESULTS\nIn order to obtain results we can compare with the\nexperiments \ufb01rst the values of the input parameters have\nto be speci\ufb01ed. The drag coe\ufb03cient \u0393 for a single head\ncan be calculated from the Stokes formula yielding \u0393 \u2248\n6\u00d710\u221211kg/s.\nThe free energy which can be gained from the ATP\nhydrolysis is about 25 kTor 100\u00d710\u221221J. During a\nstepping cycle the two conformational changes consume\nthe free energy of the ATP, while the rest length of the\nspring changes by 8 nm in both cases. This means\nthat 1/2\u00b725kT\u2248(K/2)(8 nm)2, from which we get\nK\u22481.5 pN/nm.\nA lower limit for the depth Qof the potential valleys\ncan be determined from the fact that the kinesin in rigor\nstate supports forces in excess of 10 pN. If we try to pull\nout the two-headed kinesin molecule (with drag coe\ufb03-\ncient 2\u0393) from a 2 Qdeep potential valley with a force F,\na low limit for the escape rate is\nF2\nkT2\u0393e\u22122Q/kT\nas follows from a more general expression (2) to be dis-\ncussed later. Assuming that the escape rate is much\nlarger than 10\u221221/s we get 13 kTas a lower limit of\nQ. In reality the two heads cannot be handled as one\nlarger head, because they are not \ufb01xed to each other too\nrigidly, therefore, this is a very low limit. Q\u224820kTis\nexpected to be a better estimate.\nNotethatthetemperature Tplaysanimportantrolein\nour model due to the deep potential valley the Brownian\nkinesin heads have to escape from.\nWe can assume that at the beginning of a stepping\ncycle both heads are sitting in the same valley of the\npotential. After the ATP hydrolysis, as the \ufb01rst confor-\nmational change, the strained spring is trying to stretch,\npushing one of the heads to a neighboring valley, which\nisL= 8 nm away. If the load force is small there is a\nlarge probability p+\n0L=J+\n0L/(J+\n0L+J\u2212\n0L) that the front\nhead jumps to the forward direction due to the asymme-\ntry ofthe potential valleys(the forwardslope is less steep\nthan the backward), and there is only a small probability\np\u2212\n0L=J\u2212\n0L/(J+\n0L+J\u2212\n0L) that the other head jumps back-\nward.J+\n0LandJ\u2212\n0Ldenote the corresponding jumping\nrates. Increasing the load the probability of the forward\nstep decreases while that of the backward step increases.\nThe average time t0L= 1/(J+\n0L+J\u2212\n0L) which is needed\nfor this stretching also slightly increases. Completing\nthis subprocessthe secondconformationalchangeoccurs:\nthe spring is trying to contract. Now for low load force\nthe probability p+\nL0=J+\nL0/(J+\nL0+J\u2212\nL0) that the back-\nward head jumps forward to the next valley, where the\nother head is sitting, is close to 1, while the probabil-\nityp\u2212\nL0=J\u2212\nL0/(J+\nL0+J\u2212\nL0) that the forward head jumps\nbackward is very small. Increasing the load the situation\nis similar to the previous case.Thus, under low load force the kinesin molecule steps\n8nm forwardduringalmosteachmechanochemicalcycle.\nBut increasing the load the probability that the molecule\nremainsonthe same placeoreventakesa backward8 nm\nstep increases. Reaching the stall load the average dis-\nplacement of the kinesin becomes zero.\nSince the potential valleys are very deep (compared\nto the thermal energy kT), the heads spend almost all\nof their time at the bottom, and they are able to jump\nonly very seldom. Therefore, we can calculate the above\nmentioned jumping rates ( J=J+\n0L,J\u2212\n0L,J+\nL0orJ\u2212\nL0)\nfrom an Arrhenius-like formula. All we need for this\nis the e\ufb00ective potential Ve\ufb00(x) for the jumping head\nat the bottom of the valley and at the top of the bar-\nrier. The e\ufb00ective potential consists of \ufb01ve parts: the\nV(x) periodic potential for the jumping head; the poten-\ntialFload\njxof the external load force; the spring poten-\ntial/angbracketleftbig\n(K/2)(x\u2212xr\u2212l(t))2/angbracketrightbig\nxr; the/angbracketleftbig\nV(xr)/angbracketrightbig\nxrpotential\nfor the remaining head; and the potential/angbracketleftbig\nFload\nrxr/angbracketrightbig\nxrof the external load force for the remaining head. In\nthis approximation/angbracketleftbig\n.../angbracketrightbig\nxrmeans thermal averaging for\nthe position xrof the remaining head at the bottom of\nits valley. Thus, from the corresponding Fokker-Planck\nequation the jumping rate is\nJ=D\u00b7e\u2212(Veff\nmax\u2212Veff\nmin)/kT\n/integraltext\ne\u2212(Veff(x)\u2212Veff\nmin)/kTdx\u00b7/integraltext\ne\u2212(Veff\nmax\u2212Veff(x))/kTdx,\n(2)\nwhereD=kT/\u0393 denotes the di\ufb00usion coe\ufb03cient; Ve\ufb00\nmin\nandVe\ufb00\nmaxare the minimal and the maximal values of the\ne\ufb00ective potential; and the integrals should be evaluated\naround the appropriate extremum. Due to the depth of\nthe potential valleys if we do not average the position of\nthe remaining head but assume that it always sits at the\nbottom, we get similar results.\nFrom the jumping rates one can calculate the aver-\nage displacement d= (p+\n0Lp+\nL0\u2212p\u2212\n0Lp\u2212\nL0)L= (J+\n0LJ+\nL0\u2212\nJ\u2212\n0LJ\u2212\nL0)[1/(J+\n0L+J\u2212\n0L)][1/(J+\nL0+J\u2212\nL0)]Lduring a cycle\nand the average time t=t0L+tL0= 1/(J+\n0L+J\u2212\n0L) +\n1/(J+\nL0+J\u2212\nL0) needed for this. Increasing the load the av-\nerage displacement decreases due to the increasing prob-\nabilities ofthe remaining and the backwardslippage; and\nthe average time slightly increases as a manifestation of\nthe so-called Fenn e\ufb00ect [26]. (At stall load it is about\nthree times larger than without load.)\nAtsaturatingATPconcentrationtheonlyrate-limiting\nfactor is the stepping process, therefore dividing the av-\nerage displacement by the average time gives the average\nvelocityv=d/tof the kinesin (Fig. 3a and c).\nBut at low ATP concentration the rate-limiting factor\nis the di\ufb00usion of the ATP to the kinesin heads, i.e.,\nthe stepping process is much faster than getting an ATP.\nThus the average velocity is proportional to the average\ndisplacement during one cycle with the prefactor\n\u03bd(cATP) =\u03bdsat\u00b7cATP\nKm+cATP\u2248\u03bdsat\nKm\u00b7cATP\u2248const\u00b7cATP,\n4\nwhich is the rate of the ATP consumption. cATPde-\nnotes here the ATP concentration; \u03bdsatis the inverse\naverage time of a cycle; and Kmis the mechanochem-\nical Michaelis-Menten constant. Thus the velocity of the\nkinesin is v=\u03bd(cATP)d(Fig. 3b).\nThe di\ufb00erence between the shapes of the force-velocity\ncurves at saturating (Fig. 3a and c) and at low (Fig. 3b)\nATPconcentrationshowsunambiguouslytheFenne\ufb00ect.\nChanging the distribution of the load force Fbetween\nthe heads causes the change of the average time ( t0Land\ntL0) needed for the two subprocesses, but their sum, i.e.,\ntheaverageduration tofthe steppingcycle, andthe aver-\nage displacement dremains practically unchanged. Thus\nthe force-velocity curves are essentially the same for any\ndistribution of the load force.\nWe have also solved the Langevin equations (1) by nu-\nmericalintegration and our values are in full agreement\nwith the results obtained from the above analysis.\nDISCUSSION\nOur model describes the stepping process of the ki-\nnesin molecule with elastically coupled heads. We do\nnot use reaction rate constants, but only strain induced\nconformational changes and the underlying asymmetric\nperiodic potential. Therefore, we can give the full de-\nscription of the dynamics of the motion.\nFrom Eq. (7) of Ref. [11] it follows that the displace-\nment variance of a \u201cTwo-Step\u201d process (in which each\ncycle consists of two sequential subprocesses with com-\nparable limiting rates) is r= 1\u2212ps/2 times smaller than\nthat of a single Poisson stepping process taking the same\noverall time. The stepping probability ps\u22641 denotes\nthe probability that a cycle produces a forward step. In\nour model at low load force the stepping probability is\nps=p+\n0Lp+\nL0\u22480.8, in addition, if the ATP concentra-\ntion is saturated the two subprocesses are the only rate-\nlimitingfactorswiththesamerates. Thisleadsto r\u22480.6\nas compared to r\u22480.52 given with an error in the range\nof 0.1\u22120.2 in Ref. [11]. Thus, our model explains the\nlow displacement variance at saturating ATP and at low\nload force. Furthermore, \ufb01ts the measured force-velocity\ncurvesextremely well, and is consistent with the recent\nexperimental studies of the pathway of the kinesin AT-\nPase. The parameters of the model are essentially deter-\nmined by experiments or theoretical calculations, there-\nfore, they can only be tuned in a rather restricted range.\nThe shapes of the force-velocity curves are essentially in-\nsensitive to the parameters within this range, showing\nthe robustness of the model.\nIf the relative position of the hinge to the backward\nhead is \ufb01xed as, e.g., in Fig. 2b then only one power\nstroke occurs during one cycle. The main advantage of\nthis version is that the hinge advances the whole 8 nm\ndistance at once. (Note, that in this case the \ufb01rst sub-\nprocess is not so important, thus it can be of a di\ufb00erenttype, for example, similar to the myosin step: detach-\nment, free swinging, and rebinding to the next side.) In\nany other cases (like in Fig. 2a), the two subprocesses\nmeantwopowerstrokes,andthehingeadvancesthe8nm\nin two parts. In spite of this, one may observe only 8 nm\ndisplacements, as the two power strokes occur in rapid\nsuccession.\nFrom Eq. (2) it follows that the depth and the degree\nof asymmetry of the valleys in the periodic potential we\nassumed have the strongest e\ufb00ects on the results. On the\nother hand, some further details (such as, for example,\na shallow secondary valley instead of the \ufb02at part) have\nlesssigni\ufb01cantin\ufb02uenceonthe force-velocitycurves. The\ntemperature plays an essential role in the actual mech-\nanism of the walk. The two major points where tem-\nperature comes into the picture are the following: i) the\npotential valley has to be considerably deeper than 3 kT\nto ensure proper binding, ii) on the other hand, from a\ndeep valley the heads may escape only if the spring and\nthe temperature act simultaneously since the energy of\nthe spring cannot be larger than that of the ATP hydrol-\nysis.\nTodecidewhichtheoreticalmodeldescribesthekinesin\nstepping process in the best way, further experimental\nstudies are needed. One possibility is to see how the\nforce-velocity curves continue both at higher forces than\nthe stall force and at negative forces. Another possibility\nis to measure the displacement variance at higher loads\nand at lower ATP concentrations. This could distinguish\namong the di\ufb00erent cases of our model as well, because\nfor di\ufb00erent distributions of the load force Fthe average\nduration of the subprocesses are also di\ufb00erent resulting\nin di\ufb00erent variances.\nWe are aware that C. Doering, M. Magnasco and G.\nOster have considered a similar approach to the problem\nof the kinesin walk [27].\nThe authors are grateful to J. Prost and A.

The feedback regulation proble m under\nconsideration may be interpreted as an adaptive control problem, but has not\nyet been studied in the control literature. The goal of the paper is to introduce\nthis problem and to present some \ufb01rst results.\nThe feedback regulation problem is concerned with a forced dynamic al sys-\ntem\n\u02d9x=f\u00b5(x,u(t)) (1)\nwhich depends on a parameter \u00b5. The input u(t) in equation (1) represents an\nexternal stimulus; it is not a control variable. We are interested in t he input-\nto-state properties of equation (1). In general, the input-to-s tate properties\nof equation (1) depend on the parameter \u00b5. In particular, the input-to-state\npropertiesmaychangedrasticallyasafunction of \u00b5whentheunforceddynamics\nexhibitabifurcation. Inthiscase,quiteinterestingandremarkable ampli\ufb01cation\nproperties may result from operating in the proximity of the bifurca tion point.\nWe illustrate this with two biological examples from the literature.\nThe \ufb01rst example is concerned with the auditory system. In order t o detect\nthe sounds of the outside world, hair cells in the cochlea operate as n anosen-\nsors which transform acoustic stimuli into electric signals.

Ions such as Ca++are believed to contribute to the\nhair cell\u2019s tendency to exhibit spontaneous oscillations. For low conce ntrations\nof the ions, the viscous damping forces of the \ufb02uid that surrounds the hair cells\ndominate and the hair cell oscillations are damped. As the concentra tion in-\ncreasesthe system undergoes a Hopf bifurcation, the dynamics b ecome unstable\nand the hair cells exhibit spontaneous oscillations. It is argued in thes e papers\nthat the hair cells operate in the proximity of this bifurcation point, w here\nthe activity of the ions compensates the damping e\ufb00ects. In this ca se, even a\nweak sound stimulus can cause a detectable oscillation. (This follows f rom the\ngeneric properties of a forced dynamical system exhibiting a Hopf b ifurcation).\nThis mechanism thus provides an explanation for the experimentally o bserved\nultrahigh sensitivity of the ear.\nThe second example arises in the study of persistent neural activit y [3, 12,\n14, 13]. Neural activity of a single neuron has a natural tendency t o decay with\na relaxation time of about 5\u2013100 ms. This natural tendency to deca y can be\nopposed by positive synaptic feedback loops. If this feedback is we ak, then the\nnatural tendency to decay dominates and neural activity still dec reases. As the\nfeedback gain is increased, the neural dynamics undergo a bifurca tion and the\ndynamics become unstable. When the feedback is tuned to exactly b alance the\ndecay, then neural activity neither increases nor decreases but persists without\nchange. According to a long-standing hypothesis, this is the mecha nism that so-\ncalled neural integrators use to maintain persistent neural activit y. A transient\nstimulus of a neural integrator can then cause a persistent chang e in neural\nactivity. This mechanism forms the basis for short-term analogue m emory and\nplays a central role in the oculomotor control system.\nBoth examples illustrate the remarkable and interesting input-to-s tate prop-\nerties of a dynamical system poised at a bifurcation. It is clear, how ever, that\noperatingin the proximityofabifurcationpoint requiresa\ufb01ne-tunin g ofparam-\neters. And thus the question arises as to how a (biological) system c an be tuned\nwith high precisionto its critical bifurcation point. In both examplesit has been\nsuggested that feedback regulation of the bifurcation paramete r may provide a\nrobust mechanism to ensure the required \ufb01ne-tuning of paramete rs [4, 6, 3, 16].\nIn the literature on hearing this has given rise to the terminology of \u201c self-tuned\nHopf bifurcation\u201d. Quite remarkably both studies have been pursu ed indepen-\ndently of each other in spite of their strong similarities which are obvio us from\na control engineering perspective.\nThe present paper aims to initiate a mathematical study of this feed back\nregulation problem. The problem may be formulated as follows. Find an adap-\ntation law which steers the bifurcation parameter \u00b5to its critical value \u00b50\nwithout prior knowledge of this critical value \u00b50. Our main motivation for\nstudying this problem stems from the fact that the precise biophys ical nature\nof the feedback mechanisms involved in the above biological applicatio ns is still\nunknown. A theoretical study of this problem may guide the search for pos-\nsible biophysical mechanisms. Even when the precise biophysical ada ptation\nmechanisms will have been discovered, it is to be expected that a pro found un-\n2\nderstanding of the mechanisms involved can only be achieved when ins ight has\nbeen gained in the fundamental trade-o\ufb00s and limitations that may b e inherent\nto this problem. This is very similar in spirit to the internal model princip le\nwhich has turned out to be central to the understanding of adapt ation in bacte-\nrial chemotaxis [17], and it may be seen as an illustration of the importa nt role\nthat control engineering may play in the emerging \ufb01eld of systems bio logy.\nA second motivation for the present study is of a more fundamenta l nature.\nIn view of the quite remarkable and interesting input-to-state pro perties that\narise when operating in the proximity of a bifurcation point, the prob lem under\nconsiderationmayturnouttobeofindependentinterest. Despite itsmathemat-\nical appeal, it has not attracted attention before in the control c ommunity. The\npresent paper brings together severalwell-established techniqu es from nonlinear\nand adaptive control to derive some \ufb01rst results for this problem.\nWe end this introduction with some references to related work. The present\nresearch bears some similarity with the problem of experimental inst ability de-\ntection [2], where an operating parameter is adapted online in order t o e\ufb03-\nciently locate bifurcations through experiments. A di\ufb00erent proble m which is\nrelated to the present study concerns the detection and predict ion of instabili-\nties via closed-loop monitoring techniques [9, 10]. The possible implicatio ns of\nthe present work for the problems studied in these papers remains a topic for\nfurther research.\n2 Self-tuning of a \ufb01rst-order system\nThe one-dimensional system\n\u02d9x= (\u00b5\u2212\u00b50)x+u(t) (2)\ncaptures some of the essential features of the neural integrat or. In this interpre-\ntation\u00b50represents the natural decay rate of neural activity and \u00b5corresponds\nto the synaptic feedback gain. We view \u00b5as an adjustable parameter and \u00b50as\nan unknown constant. Clearly this system exhibits a bifurcation. If \u00b5=\u00b50then\nequation (2) behaves as a perfect integrator, if \u00b5 < \u00b5 0(respectively \u00b5 > \u00b5 0)\nthen equation (2) is referred to as a leaky(respectively unstable) integrator. We\nask the question as to how proximity to the bifurcation point may be e nsured.\nWe study this question from an engineering perspective. In a \ufb01rst a pproxi-\nmation we ignore the presence of the input and ask the following simple r ques-\ntion. Find an adaptation law for the parameter \u00b5which steers \u00b5to its bifurca-\ntion value \u00b50for the system\n\u02d9x= (\u00b5\u2212\u00b50)x. (3)\nThis adaptation law may depend on xand\u00b5, but should be independent of \u00b50,\nas this value is not known (precisely). Let us \ufb01rst discuss the feasib ility of this\nproblem. It is easy to see that if x= 0 at some time instant then x= 0 for\nall times and in this case it is clearly impossible to steer \u00b5to\u00b50without prior\n3\nknowledge of \u00b50. We therefore restrict attention to the set of strictly positive\nvaluesfor x, whichisinvariantunderthedynamics(3). Consideringonlystrictly\npositive values for xis physically relevant, as this variable represents a level of\nneural activity (rate of action potential \ufb01ring).\nThe following theorem provides su\ufb03cient conditions for the adaptat ion law\n\u02d9\u00b5=f(x)\u2212g(\u00b5) (4)\nto steer\u00b5to its bifurcation value \u00b50for the system (3).\nTheorem 1. Let\u00b50\u2208Rand consider continuously di\ufb00erentiable functions f:\nR>0\u2192Randg:R\u2192R. Assume that fis strictly decreasing, gis strictly\nincreasing, and g(\u00b50)is in the image of f. Then the nonlinear system (3)\u2013\n(4)withx\u2208R>0and\u00b5\u2208Rhas a unique equilibrium point, which is globally\nasymptotically stable (and locally exponentially stable i fdf/dxtakes only strictly\nnegative values and dg/d\u00b5only strictly positive values). At equilibrium \u00b5equals\n\u00b50.\nThe proof relies on a coordinate transformation which converts (3 )\u2013(4) into\na nonlinear mass-spring-damper system. Global asymptotic stabilit y follows\nreadily from LaSalle\u2019s theorem. Local exponential stability is shown b y means\nof the linearization principle.\nProof.We introducenew coordinates q= ln(x)\u2212ln(f\u22121(g(\u00b50))) andp=\u00b5\u2212\u00b50.\nThis transformation from ( x,\u00b5) to (q,p) is a global C\u221e-di\ufb00eomorphism from\nR>0\u00d7RtoR2. Expressed in these new coordinates (3)\u2013(4) becomes\n\u02d9q=p, (5)\n\u02d9p=f(exp(q)f\u22121(g(\u00b50)))\u2212g(p+\u00b50). (6)\nThe system of equations (5)\u2013(6) has a unique equilibrium point at the origin.\nThis equilibrium corresponds to an equilibrium in original coordinates wh ere\n\u00b5=\u00b50.\nFirst we prove that the null-solution of (5)\u2013(6) is globally asymptotic ally\nstable. We rewrite (5)\u2013(6) as\n\u02d9q=p, (7)\n\u02d9p=\u2212\u02dcf(q)\u2212\u02dcg(p), (8)\nwith\u02dcf(q) =\u2212f(exp(q)f\u22121(g(\u00b50)))+g(\u00b50) and \u02dcg(p) =g(p+\u00b50)\u2212g(\u00b50). Clearly\n\u02dcfand \u02dcgare both strictly increasing, continuously di\ufb00erentiable functions f rom\nRtoRwhich are zero at zero.

Since the transformation from ( x,\u00b5) to (q,p) is aC\u221e-di\ufb00eomorphism it\nsu\ufb03ces to prove that the null-solution of (5)\u2013(6) is locally exponent ially stable.\nThis followsreadilyfromthe linearizationprinciple. The linearizationof ( 5)\u2013(6)\naround the origin is given by\n\u02d9q=p, (11)\n\u02d9p=df\ndx(f\u22121(g(\u00b50)))f\u22121(g(\u00b50))q\u2212dg\nd\u00b5(\u00b50)p. (12)\nIf df/dxtakes only strictly negative values and d g/d\u00b5only strictly positive\nvalues then the linearization (11)\u2013(12) is exponentially stable, as re quired.\nDiscussion of Theorem 1\n1. A mathematically appealing adaptation law which satis\ufb01es the assum p-\ntions of Theorem 1 for all possible values of \u00b50is given by\n\u02d9\u00b5=\u2212aln(x)\u2212b\u00b5 (13)\nwitha,b >0. This adaptation law ensures convergence to the bifurcation\npoint for any possible value of \u00b50. It has the interesting property that the\ncoordinate transformation introduced in the proof of Theorem 1 c onverts\n(3), (13) into the linearsystem\n\u02d9q=p, (14)\n\u02d9p=\u2212aq\u2212bp. (15)\nFrom a biological point of view however this adaptation law is probably\nnot very relevant, among others because the right hand side of (1 3) is not\nbounded. A bounded adaptation law which could be more relevant for\nbiological applications is for example\n\u02d9\u00b5= 1/(1+x2)\u22121/(1+exp( \u2212\u00b5)). (16)\nThis bounded adaptation law also ensures convergence to the bifur cation\npoint for any possible value of \u00b50.\n5\n2. There is a subtle relationship between self-tuning of bifurcations and ideas\nfrom robust control theory. This relation is made explicit by equatio n (5),\nwhich represents an integrator and corresponds to integral act ion stud-\nied in robust control theory. Although perhaps surprising at \ufb01rst sight,\nthis relation may be understood by regarding the constant \u00b50as an un-\nknown perturbation acting on the system. It is well-known from rob ust\ncontrol theory that (under appropriate conditions) rejecting o r tracking\nan unknown, constant disturbance requires integral action. (Th is is a spe-\ncial case of the internal model principle\u2014see [17, 15] for a discussio n of\nthe internal model principle from a systems biology perspective). T he\npresent manifestation of integral action, however, di\ufb00ers from t raditional\nrobust control situations because the integral action is not gene rated by\nthe adaptation law but is inherent to the dynamics of system (3) itse lf.\n3. If an additional perturbation term \u03b5p(x,\u00b5,t) is considered\n\u02d9x= (\u00b5\u2212\u00b50)x+\u03b5p(x,\u00b5,t), (17)\nwe may conclude that the adaptation law (4) steers \u00b5approximately to\n\u00b50under the conditions of Theorem 1 provided the perturbation is sma ll\nenough.\nTheorem 2. Let\u00b50\u2208Rand consider continuously di\ufb00erentiable func-\ntionsf:R>0\u2192Randg:R\u2192R. Assume that fis strictly decreas-\ning,gis strictly increasing, and g(\u00b50)is in the image of f. Consider a\nstrictly positive parameter \u03b5and a continuous function p:R>0\u00d7R2\u2192\nR: (x,\u00b5,t)\u2192p(x,\u00b5,t)and assume that pis bounded in tuniformly with\nrespect to (x,\u00b5)belonging to compact subsets of R>0\u00d7R. Then the unique\nequilibrium point for the original system (3)\u2013(4)is uniformly semiglobally\npractically asymptotically stable for the perturbed syste m(17)\u2013(4).\n(We refer to the Appendix for a de\ufb01nition of uniform semiglobal prac tical\nasymptotic stability.) In particular, this theorem guarantees that along\nall trajectories of (17)\u2013(4) originating in an arbitrarily large compa ct sub-\nset ofR>0\u00d7R,\u00b5will eventually converge to an arbitrarily small open\nneighborhood of \u00b50provided \u03b5is small enough. This result is a manifesta-\ntion of the well-known robustness of asymptotic stability with respe ct to\nsmall perturbations. It provides some justi\ufb01cation for ignoring th e exter-\nnal stimulus in equation(2) and studying the simplerequation (3) inst ead,\nat least in a \ufb01rst approximation.\n3 A second-order system\nIn a series of articles [4, 5, 6, 7] it is argued that various nonlinear ph enomena\nin the auditory system (such as ultrahigh sensitivity to weak signals) may be\nunderstood in terms of the generic properties of a forced dynamic al system\n6\nexhibiting a Hopf bifurcation. In [6] this is illustrated by means of a sta ndard\nmodel for nonlinear oscillations which (with the notation of the prese nt paper)\ntakes the form\n\u00a8x+(\u00b50\u2212\u00b5)\u02d9x+\u03bb\u02d9x3+\u03c92x=u(t). (18)\nAs before \u00b5is an adjustable parameter and \u00b50is an unknown constant. In the\nabsence of an external input u, equation (18) describes damped oscillations if\n\u00b5 < \u00b5 0. At\u00b5=\u00b50the system undergoes a Hopf bifurcation and for \u00b5 > \u00b5 0\nspontaneous oscillations are being generated. Assuming that it is po ssible to\ntune\u00b5=\u00b50suchamodel capturesthe biophysicalnatureofhaircelloscillation s\nwithin the cochleawhere the hair cells are thought of as active, almost self-\noscillating systems rather than passive oscillators. In [4, 5, 6, 7] it is shown how\nsuch a dynamical system operating at a Hopf bifurcation indeed may account\nfor several of the observed nonlinear phenomena in hearing. Again the question\narises as to how proximity to the bifurcation point may be ensured. I n [4, 6] it\nis suggested that a feedback mechanism is responsible for this self- tuning and\nnumerical simulations are provided to support this claim.\nHere we want to contribute to a mathematical analysis of self-tunin g of an\noscillator. In a \ufb01rst approximation we ignore the cubic damping term a nd the\nexternal input and we study the following question. Find an adaptat ion law\nfor the parameter \u00b5which does not depend on \u00b50and which steers \u00b5to its\nbifurcation value \u00b50for the system\n\u00a8x+(\u00b50\u2212\u00b5)\u02d9x+\u03c92x= 0. (19)\nAs before let us \ufb01rst discuss the feasibility of this problem. It is easy to see\nthat ifx= \u02d9x= 0 at some time instant then x= \u02d9x= 0 for all times and in this\ncase it is clearly impossible to steer \u00b5to\u00b50without prior knowledge of \u00b50. We\ntherefore restrict attention to the set where xand \u02d9xare not both zero\u2014this set\nis invariant under the dynamics (19).\nThe following theorem asserts that the adaptation law\n\u02d9\u00b5=\u2212aln(/radicalbig\nx2+(\u02d9x/\u03c9)2)\u2212b\u00b5 (20)\nsteers\u00b5to its bifurcation value \u00b50for the system (19) if 0 < a\u2264b2andb >0.\nTheorem 3. Let\u00b50\u2208Randa,b,\u03c9\u2208R>0. Assume that a\u2264b2. The nonlinear\nsystem(19)\u2013(20)with(x,\u02d9x)\u2208R2\\ {(0,0)}and\u00b5\u2208Rhas a unique periodic\norbit1which is globally asymptotically stable and locally expone ntially stable. On\nthis periodic orbit \u00b5=\u00b50.\nThe proof of global asymptotic stability is based on passivity techniq ues.\nWe interpret (19)\u2013(20) (in a di\ufb00erent coordinate system) as a fee dback inter-\nconnection of a linear system with a dynamic feedback which satis\ufb01es a sector\ncondition. Via the Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov lemma we obtain a prope r, non-\nincreasing Lyapunov function. Global asymptotic stability of the pe riodic orbit\nthen follows from LaSalle\u2019s invariance principle.\n1A periodic orbit is a subset of the state-space which is the im age of a periodic solution.\n7\nProof.First we introduce new coordinates rand\u03c6according to x=rcos(\u03c6)\nand \u02d9x=\u2212r\u03c9sin(\u03c6). The transformation from ( x,\u02d9x) to (r,\u03c6) is a global\nC\u221e-di\ufb00eomorphism from R2\\ {(0,0)}toR>0\u00d7S1. Expressed in the coor-\ndinates ( r,\u03c6,\u00b5), equations (19)\u2013(20) become\n\u02d9r= (\u00b5\u2212\u00b50)rsin2(\u03c6), (21)\n\u02d9\u03c6=\u03c9+(\u00b5\u2212\u00b50)sin(\u03c6)cos(\u03c6), (22)\n\u02d9\u00b5=\u2212aln(r)\u2212b\u00b5. (23)\nNext we introduce new coordinates q= ln(r) +b\u00b50/aandp=\u00b5\u2212\u00b50. The\ntransformationfrom ( r,\u00b5) to (q,p) is a global C\u221e-di\ufb00eomorphism from R>0\u00d7R\ntoR2. Expressed in the coordinates ( q,\u03c6,p), equations (21)\u2013(23) become\n\u02d9q=psin2(\u03c6), (24)\n\u02d9\u03c6=\u03c9+psin(\u03c6)cos(\u03c6), (25)\n\u02d9p=\u2212aq\u2212bp. (26)\nClearly the system of equations (24)\u2013(26) has a periodic orbit {(q,\u03c6,p)\u2208R\u00d7\nS1\u00d7R:q=p= 0}which we denote by A. This periodic orbit corresponds\nto a periodic orbit in original coordinates where \u00b5=\u00b50. It is clear from the\nfollowing paragraph that this periodic orbit is unique.\nFirst we prove that the periodic orbit Aof (24)\u2013(26) is globally asymptot-\nically stable. We interpret (24)\u2013(26) as a feedback interconnectio n of a linear\ncontrol system\n\u02d9q=\u2212u, (27)\n\u02d9p=\u2212aq\u2212bp, (28)\nwith a negative, dynamic feedback u=\u2212sin2(\u03c6)pwhere\u03c6satis\ufb01es (25). The\ntransfer function H(s) of (27)\u2013(28) from utopis given by\nH(s) =a\ns(s+b). (29)\nSinceaandbare strictly positive and a\u2264b2the transfer function H(s)+1 is\npositive real. Hence by (a modi\ufb01ed version of) the Kalman-Yakubovic h-Popov\nlemma (proven in [1] and described in [8, Exercise 10.2]) there exists a p ositive\nde\ufb01nite, quadratic Lyapunov function ( q,p)/mapsto\u2192V(q,p) whose time derivative\nalong the solutions of the control system (27)\u2013(28) satis\ufb01es\n\u02d9V(q,p,u)\u2264up+u2. (30)\nIn other words the control system (27)\u2013(28) with input uand output pis input\nfeedforwardpassivewith a shortageofpassivity [11]. Since the fee dback satis\ufb01es\nup+u2= (sin4(\u03c6)\u2212sin2(\u03c6))p2=\u2212(sin(\u03c6)cos(\u03c6)p)2, (31)\n8\nit follows that the time-derivative of Valong the solutions of (24)\u2013(26) satis\ufb01es\n\u02d9V(q,\u03c6,p)/braceleftBigg\n<0 if sin( \u03c6)cos(\u03c6)p/\\e}atio\\slash= 0,\n= 0 if sin( \u03c6)cos(\u03c6)p= 0.(32)\nSince (q,\u03c6,p)/mapsto\u2192V(q,p) is positive de\ufb01nite with respect to the periodic orbit A\nit follows that Ais stable. In addition, since ( q,\u03c6,p)/mapsto\u2192V(q,p) is radially\nunbounded with respect to Aand since Ais compact it follows that every\nsolution of (24)\u2013(26) is bounded. Finally, since Ais the largest invariant set of\n(24)\u2013(26) contained in {(q,\u03c6,p)\u2208R\u00d7S1\u00d7R:\u02d9V(q,\u03c6,p) = 0}it follows from\nLaSalle\u2019s theorem that every solution of (24)\u2013(26) converges to A.\nIt remains to be proven that the periodic orbit of (19)\u2013(20) is locally ex-\nponentially stable. This follows directly from Theorem 4 which is stated and\nproven below.\nAlthough mathematically appealing, the adaptation law (20) is probab lynot\nvery relevant from a biological point of view, among others because the right\nhand side is not bounded. It would therefore be interesting to have a result\navailable that applies to more general adaptation laws\n\u02d9\u00b5=f(/radicalbig\nx2+(\u02d9x/\u03c9)2)\u2212g(\u00b5). (33)\nThis is the subject of Theorem 4. Unlike the previous results, Theor em 4 is a\nlocal stability result.\nTheorem 4. Let\u00b50\u2208Rand consider continuously di\ufb00erentiable functions f:\nR>0\u2192Randg:R\u2192R. Assume that g(\u00b50)is in the image of f. Consider\nr\u2217\u2208f\u22121(g(\u00b50))and assume that 0<\u2212(df/dr)(r\u2217)r\u2217\u2264((dg/d\u00b5)(\u00b50))2and\n(dg/d\u00b5)(\u00b50)>0. Then the system of equations (19)and(33)with(x,\u02d9x)\u2208\nR2\\{(0,0)}and\u00b5\u2208Rhas a periodic orbit which is locally exponentially stable\nand where \u00b5=\u00b50.\nProof.We proceed along the lines of the proof of Theorem 3. First we introd uce\nnew coordinates rand\u03c6according to x=rcos(\u03c6) and \u02d9x=\u2212r\u03c9sin(\u03c6). The\ntransformation from ( x,\u02d9x) to (r,\u03c6) is a global C\u221e-di\ufb00eomorphism from R2\\\n{(0,0)}toR>0\u00d7S1. Expressed in the coordinates ( r,\u03c6,\u00b5), equations (19) and\n(33) become\n\u02d9r= (\u00b5\u2212\u00b50)rsin2(\u03c6), (34)\n\u02d9\u03c6=\u03c9+(\u00b5\u2212\u00b50)sin(\u03c6)cos(\u03c6), (35)\n\u02d9\u00b5=f(r)\u2212g(\u00b5). (36)\nNext we introduce new coordinates q= ln(r)\u2212ln(r\u2217) andp=\u00b5\u2212\u00b50. The\ntransformationfrom ( r,\u00b5) to (q,p) is a global C\u221e-di\ufb00eomorphism from R>0\u00d7R\ntoR2. Expressed in the coordinates ( q,\u03c6,p), equations (34)\u2013(36) become\n\u02d9q=psin2(\u03c6), (37)\n\u02d9\u03c6=\u03c9+psin(\u03c6)cos(\u03c6), (38)\n\u02d9p=f(exp(q)r\u2217)\u2212g(p+\u00b50). (39)\n9\nClearly the system of equations (37)\u2013(39) has a periodic orbit {(q,\u03c6,p)\u2208R\u00d7\nS1\u00d7R:q=p= 0}which we denote by A. This periodic orbit corresponds to\na periodic orbit in original coordinates where \u00b5=\u00b50.\nSince the transformation from ( x,\u02d9x,\u00b5) to (q,\u03c6,p) is aC\u221e-di\ufb00eomorphism it\nsu\ufb03ces to prove that the periodic orbit Aof (37)\u2013(39) is locally exponentially\nstable. We \ufb01rst ignore the \u201chigher order\u201d terms in the right hand sid e of (38)\nand (39) and consider the simpler system\n\u02d9q=psin2(\u03c6), (40)\n\u02d9\u03c6=\u03c9, (41)\n\u02d9p=\u2212aq\u2212bp, (42)\nwherewehaveintroducedthenotation a=\u2212(df/dr)(r\u2217)r\u2217andb= (dg/d\u00b5)(\u00b50).\nBy the assumptions of the theorem 0 < a\u2264b2andb >0. Repeating the ar-\nguments of the proof of Theorem 4 it is easy to see that the set Ais a globally\nasymptotically stable periodic orbit of (40)\u2013(42). Because of the s pecial struc-\nture of equation (41) we may interpret \u03c6as a time variable and the system of\nequations (40) and (42) as a periodically time-varying linear system. With this\ninterpretation the periodic orbit Aof (40)\u2013(42) corresponds to the null-solution\nof the linear system of equations (40) and (42). Standard conver se theorems\nfor periodically time-varying linear systems (see for example [8, Theo rem 3.10])\nyield the existence of strictly positive real numbers c1,c2andc3and a continu-\nously di\ufb00erentiable Lyapunov function ( q,\u03c6,p)/mapsto\u2192V(q,\u03c6,p) which is quadratic\nin (q,p) and (together with its partial derivative \u2202V/\u2202\u03c6) bounded in \u03c6such\nthat\nc1(q2+p2)\u2264V(q,\u03c6,p)\u2264c2(q2+p2) (43)\nand such that the time derivative of Valong the solutions of (40)\u2013(42) satis\ufb01es\n\u02d9V(q,\u03c6,p)\u2264 \u2212c3(q2+p2). (44)\nWith this Lyapunov function Vwe now prove that the periodic orbit Aof (37)\u2013\n(39) is locally exponentially stable. Indeed, for qandpsu\ufb03ciently close to zero\nthe time derivative of Vevaluated along the solutions of (37)\u2013(39) satis\ufb01es\n\u02d9V(q,\u03c6,p)\u2264 \u2212c3\n2(q2+p2) (45)\nsince the extra terms in the right hand side of (38) and (39) give rise to extra\nterms in the Lyapunov balance which are bounded in \u03c6and of order higher\nthan two in ( q,p). This shows that the periodic orbit Aof (37)\u2013(39) is locally\nexponentially stable.\nDiscussion of Theorems 3 and 4\n1. The assumptions of Theorem 4 involve the unknown critical value \u00b50.\nIf\u00b50is known to belong to some interval, it is of interest to have an\n10\nadaptation law which satis\ufb01es the assumptions of the theorem for a ll\u00b50\nin this interval. For example, it is easily veri\ufb01ed that the adaptation law\n\u02d9\u00b5= 1/(1+/parenleftBig/radicalbig\nx2+(\u02d9x/\u03c9)2/parenrightBiga\n)\u2212b\u00b5 (46)\nwith 0< a\u22644b2andb >0 satis\ufb01es all assumptions of the theorem if\n0< \u00b50<1/b.\n2. The proposed adaptation laws (20) and (33) depend not only on xand\n\u00b5but also on \u02d9 xand\u03c9. Their implementation requires that the state\nvariable \u02d9 xis measured and the parameter \u03c9is known. This may be a\ndisadvantage.\n3. If an additional perturbation term \u03b5p(x,\u02d9x,\u00b5,t) is considered\n\u00a8x+(\u00b50\u2212\u00b5)\u02d9x+\u03c92x=\u03b5p(x,\u02d9x,\u00b5,t), (47)\nwe may conclude that the adaptation law (20) or (33) steers \u00b5approxi-\nmately to \u00b50under the conditions of Theorem 3 or Theorem 4 provided\nthe perturbation is small enough.\nTheorem 5. Let\u00b50\u2208Rand consider continuously di\ufb00erentiable func-\ntionsf:R>0\u2192Randg:R\u2192R. Assume that g(\u00b50)is in the image\noff. Consider r\u2217\u2208f\u22121(g(\u00b50))and assume that 0<\u2212(df/dr)(r\u2217)r\u2217\u2264\n((dg/d\u00b5)(\u00b50))2and(dg/d\u00b5)(\u00b50)>0. Consider a strictly positive param-\neter\u03b5and a continuous function p: (R2\\{0})\u00d7R2\u2192R: (x,\u02d9x,\u00b5,t)\u2192\np(x,\u02d9x,\u00b5,t)and assume that pis bounded in tuniformly with respect\nto(x,\u02d9x,\u00b5)belonging to compact subsets of (R2\\ {0})\u00d7R. Then there\nis a subset of (R2\\{0})\u00d7Rwhere\u00b5=\u00b50and which is uniformly practi-\ncally asymptotically stable for the perturbed system (47)and(33). Iff(\u00b7)\nandg(\u00b5)take the particular form \u2212aln(\u00b7)respectively b\u00b5, then there is a\nsubset of (R2\\{0})\u00d7Rwhere\u00b5=\u00b50and which is uniformly semiglobally\npractically asymptotically stable.\n(WerefertotheAppendixforade\ufb01nitionofthenotionofuniform(s emiglobal)\npractical asymptotic stability.) This result is a manifestation of the w ell-\nknown robustness of asymptotic (or exponential) stability with res pect to\nsmall perturbations. It provides some justi\ufb01cation for ignoring th e cu-\nbic nonlinearity and external stimulus in equation (18) and studying t he\nsimpler equation (19) instead, at least in a \ufb01rst approximation.\nReferences\n[1] B.

Due to this complimentarity, the famous DNA walk representation whose statistical\ninterpretation is still unresolved is shown to be a special c ase of the present formalism with a\ndensity distribution corresponding to a purine or a pyrimid ine group. Another interesting aspect\nof most of the DNA sequences is that the factorial moments as a function of length exceed unity\naround a region where the variance versus length in a log-log plot shows a bending. This is a\npure phenomenological observation which is found for sever al DNA sequences with a few exception.\nTherefore, this length scale has been used as an approximate measure to exclude the bending regions\nfrom the slope analyses. The asymmetries in the nucleotide c ontents or the patchy structure as a\npossible origin of the long range correlations has also been investigated.\nPAC(s) 87.14.Gg.87.16.AC,05.10.-a\nI. INTRODUCTION\nRecently, therehasbeen considerableinterestin the \ufb01ndingoflong rangecorrelationsin genomicDNA sequences[1].\nADNAsequenceisachainofsites, eachoccupiedbyeitherapurine(A denineandGuanine)orapyrimidine(Cytocyine\nand Thymine) group. For mathematical modeling, the DNA sequence might be considered as a string of symbols\n(G, A, T and C) whose correlation structure can be characterized completely by all possible base-base correlation\nfunctions or their corresponding power spectra. Di\ufb00erent techn iques including mutual information functions and\npower spectra analyses [1\u20139], auto correlation [10\u201312], DNA walk rep resentation [13\u201320], wavelet analysis [21,22]\nand Zipf analysis [23] were used for statistical analyses of DNA sequ ences. But despite the e\ufb00ort spent, it is still\nan open question whether the long range correlation properties ar e di\ufb00erent for protein coding (exonic) and non\ncoding (intronic, intergenemic) sequences [24]. One more fundamen tal ground, there is still continuing debate as to\nwhether the reported long range correlations really mean a lack of in dependence at long distances or simply re\ufb02ect\nthe patchiness (bias in nucleotide composition) of DNA sequences. T here have been attempts to eliminate local\npatchiness using methods such as min-max [13], detrended \ufb02uctuat ion analysis (DFA) [24,25] and wavelet analysis\n[21]. In spite of its success in modeling the long range correlations obs erved in DNA sequences, as indicated by the\npower law increase in the variance and the inverse power law spectru m [5,9], the problem of the correct statistical\ninterpretation of DNA walk is still unresolved and is attracting the at tention of an increasing number of investigators.\nSince approaches based on di\ufb00erent models predict di\ufb00erent corre lation structure, there is no unique measure of the\ndegree of correlation in DNA sequences. Therefore, it is very impor tant to investigate the correlations and extract\nthe power law exponent \u03b1rather in a model independent way so that the interpretation of th e data including the\ntheoretical analysis becomes more meaningful. There is another co nfusion related to this study is the absence of a\nclear de\ufb01nition of the term \u201dlong range\u201d. Clearly, what is considered to be long is relative to what is considered\nto be short. To over come some of these problems, recently we hav e suggested a new method [26] to measure the\ndegree of correlations using the variance analysis of the density dis tribution of a single or a group of nucleotides. We\nhave also suggested a way to \ufb01nd out an approximate length scale ab ove which all DNA sequences show strong long\nrange correlations irrespective of their intron contents while below this, the correlation is relatively weak. Further,\nthe density distribution which is nearly Gaussian at short distances s hows signi\ufb01cant deviations from the Gaussian\nstatistics at large distances. In this paper, we present the details of the analyses and also extract the correlation\nparameter \u03b1for several intron containing and intronless sequences.\n1\nII. DENSITY DISTRIBUTION AND FACTORIAL MOMENTS:\nIn the present method, we build the frequency spectrum of a single or a group of nucleotides by dividing the DNA\nsequence into many equal intervals of length l. For example, to build a purine spectrum, we compute\nn=l0+l/summationdisplay\ni=l0ui (1)\nwhereui=1 if the site is occupied by a G or A and ui=0 otherwise. Ideally, one can divide the entire DNA sequence of\nlengthLintomequal intervals of size l(l=L/m). The purine or GA spectrum can be built by computing nfrom all\nthe intervals. Alternatively, ncan be computed in any segment between l0andl0+land the spectrum ( ndistribution\norPn) is built by varying the starting position l0from 1, 2, 3 etc upto L\u2212lso as to cover the whole sequence1. We\nadopt this second procedure for better statistics. Finally, the st andard deviation (SD) of this Pndistribution can be\nobtained from \u03c32=< n2\u2212n02>which in general will depend on the interval or the window size l.\nIn addition to the standard deviation \u03c32, we also compute the factorial moments Fq\u2019s ofPn. The normalized\nfactorial moments of order q are written as\nFq=fq\nfq\n1(2)\nwhere\nfq=\u221e/summationdisplay\nn=qPnn(n\u22121).....(n\u2212q+1) =\u221e/summationdisplay\nn=qn!\n(n\u2212q)!Pn (3)\nAs will be shown later, the factorial moment has the distinct advant age over the normal moments in identifying the\ngenomic sequence from the random one. It may be mentioned here t hat for random Poisson distribution, the factorial\nmoments for all q\u2019s become unity i.e. for\nPn=ane\u2212a\nn!(4)\nthe above factor for fqbecomes\nfq=\u221e/summationdisplay\nn=qn!\n(n\u2212q)!ane\u2212a\nn!=\u221e/summationdisplay\nn=qane\u2212a\n(n\u2212q)!=\u221e/summationdisplay\nm=0am+qe\u2212a\nm!=aq\u221e/summationdisplay\nm=0ame\u2212a\nm!=aq(5)\nwhich gives Fq=1.\nIn this work, we have applied the above factorial moment analysis (g enerally used to study the \ufb02uctuations during\na phase transition [27]) to study the dynamical \ufb02uctuations presen t in the DNA sequences.\nIII. PRINCIPLE OF COMPLIMENTARITY\nA general property noticed for all the genomic sequences (of sta tistically signi\ufb01cant length) with a few exceptions\nis that the distributions of any single or group of nucleotides which ha s a probability of occurrence phas the same\nvariance \u03c3as that of its complimentary group that has the probability of occur rence (1 \u2212p), although both have\ndi\ufb00erent distribution functions. This would imply that even a single nuc leotide distribution say Gdistribution will\nhave same variance as that of ATCdistribution or a GAdistribution will have identical variance as that of TC\ndistribution. Figure 1 shows \u03c3versuslplots for GandGAdistributions (solid curves) for two typical sequences of\nDROMHC (Drosphilia Melanogaster, MHC, 22663 bps, 20 .5%G, 30.3%A, 25.4%T, 23.8%C) andSCMIT(yeast\n1At short distances, ncan be zero due to the non occurence of a given nucleotide. In s uch cases, the density spectrum can be\nbuilt either including or excluding zerothchannel. In this analysis, we include zerothchannel also so that the complementarity\nis satis\ufb01ed which is unlike the case when the zerothchannel is excluded. See appendix B for details\n2\nmitochondrial DNA, 9 .1%G, 42.2%A, 40.7%T, 8.0%C). As can be seen from the \ufb01gure, the GandGAdistributions\nhave same \u03c3at all scale as that of ATCandTCdistributions (\ufb01lled circles) although the distribution functions of\nthe two complimentary groups need not be identical. The above agre ement is exact for most of the DNA sequences\n(with a few exceptions) as well as for the random sequences. For e xample, the \u03c3forGandATCdistributions of\nSCMITandE.Coli:TN10 (E.Coliwith aTN10 mobile transposion (9147 bps) at location 22000 bps) show 2% to\n3% deviations at all scale depending on the total length of the seque nces where as for other DNA as well as random\nsequences, this agreement is exact. (This di\ufb00erence is not visible fr om \ufb01gure 1 in case of SCMITas the deviation\nis insigni\ufb01cant over a large distance).\nFIG. 1. The variance \u03c3versuslforGandGAdistributions (solid curves). Top panel is for DROMHC (Drosophilia\nMelanogaster, MHC) while the bottom panel for SCMIT(yeast mitocondrial DNA). The \ufb01lled circles are for the comp limen-\ntaryATCandTCdistributions. The curve RW(dotted curve) corresponds to the slope in case of random wal k (see text for\ndetails). The curves are scaled up appropriately for better clarity.\nWithin the present formalism, we can also reproduce the result of ra ndom walk ( RW) model (See appendix for\nmore detail) by assigning ui= 1 for purine group ( GandA) andui=\u22121 for pyrimidine group ( TandC). However,\nunlike the random walk model of interpreting +1 and \u22121 as the probability of step up and step down, Pncan be\nconsidered as the frequency distribution of nwhich gives the excess or de\ufb01cit of purines over pyrimidines. The \u03c3\nversuslas obtained from this assignment has also been shown in \ufb01gure 1 (see the dotted curves labeled RW) for\ncomparison. It is interesting to note that the RWcurves shows a parallel shift with respect to the GAorTCcurves\nindicating that GAorTCdistributions and RWmodel have similar \ufb02uctuations at all scale. This is an interesting\nobservations, as we can now use GAorTCdistributions as alternatives to the DNA walk representation to stu dy the\ncorrelation. The advantage is, since nrepresents a sum, unlike the DNA walk model, the entire spectrum lies to the\npositive side of the coordinates which is essential to compute variou s higher moments like Fqof the distributions.\nIt is also important to note that although the complimentary distribu tions have same \u03c3at all scale, the distribution\nfunctions need not be exactly identical. Figure 2 shows a typical nor malized density distribution functions Pnof\ntwo complimentary distributions GandATCfor the above two sequences ( SCMITandDROMHC ) as a function\nofn\u2212n0(wheren0is the average count ) at a typical length scale of l= 150 (\ufb01gures in left). The \ufb01gures to the\nright shows Pndistributions ( x-axis is shifted by 100 for clarity) corresponding to the two purely r andom sequences\nhaving same length and nucleotide contents as that of DROMHC andSCMITsequences. It is interesting to note\nthat although \u03c3versuslplots are (nearly) identical i.e., both distributions have same \ufb02uctuations at all scales, the\ndistribution functions are not identical. This is an important charact eristic of a DNA sequence which is not found in\ncase of a random one.\n3\nFIG. 2. The complimentary GandATCdensity distributions at a typical distance of l= 150 for above two sequences.\nThe curves on the right (shifted by 100 units) shows the corre sponding distributions in case of a purely random sequence o f\nappropriate G,A,TandCcontents.\nIV. EXTRACTION OF SLOPE PARAMETER\nThe long range correlations are generally studied from the relation \u03c3\u223cl\u03b1where the parameter \u03b1is extracted from\nthe\u03c3versuslplot in the log-log scale. For the case of a completely random sequenc e,\u03b1\u223c0.5. The deviation of\n\u03b1from 0.5 indicates presence of long range correlations. We have estimated \u03c3ofG,A,T,CandGAdistributions\nfor several DNA sequences and found that \u03c3versuslplot in the log-log scale is not linear over the entire length2.\nFigure 3 shows \u03c3versuslplot (bottom panel) for a typical E.Colisequence of length L= 1.2 Mbps (solid curves)\nandL= 30 Kbps (dotted curves) respectively. The top panel shows the factorial distributions of q=2, 3, 4 and 6 for\na typical Adistributions, although similar plots can be obtained for other nucleo tide distributions as well. A general\nfeature of the factorial moments of the DNA sequence with a few e xception is that at short distances, Fq<1.0 for all\nq\u2032sand exceeds unity at some point say at lq. This behavior is not found in case of a purely random sequence wher e\nFqis always \u22641.0. Further, all q\u2019s do not cross unity exactly at the same point, lqbeing more for higher qvalues.\nHowever, this variation is insigni\ufb01cant over a very large scale if we res trict to some of the lower moments say up to\nq= 6.\nFrom these plots and also from the several other studies, we make following few observations; (i) The \u03c3versusl\nplot is not linear through out, rather starts bending around some r egion (say lc, which could be di\ufb00erent for di\ufb00erent\ndistributions) indicating a change of slope from \u03b11to\u03b12, (ii) For most of the cases, while \u03b11shows weak deviation\nfrom 0.5,\u03b12deviates signi\ufb01cantly from 0 .5 and also depends on the sequence length L, (iii) The individual nucleotide\ndistributions may have stronger correlations than any sum like GAandTCdistributions or any other combinations.\n2We consider only the G,A,TandCdistributions to extract the correlation parameters for th e individual nucelotides and\nGAdistributions to simulate the results of random walk model\n4\nFIG. 3. (a) The factorial moments Fqversuslfor a typical Adistributions of E.Colisequence of length 1.2 Mbps. (b) The\ncorresponding slope parameter \u03c3versuslforE.Coliof length 1.2 Mbps (solid curves) and of length 30 Kbps (dashe d curves).\nThe curves are scaled up appropriately for clarity.\nSince\u03c3versuslin the log-log plot starts bending around lc, we can extract the slope by dividing the entire length\ninto two segments; one for l < lcand the other one for l > lc. This can be done by examining each case individually.\nHowever, we have noticed an approximate correlationbetween this bending region in \u03c3versuslplot and the cross over\npointslqof the corresponding factorial moments i.e. the slope changes aro und the same region where the factorial\nmoments become unity. This is a pure phenomenological observation which is found for several DNA sequences as\nlisted in tables with a few exceptions which we will discuss below. It may b e mentioned here that although, the\ntwo complimentary distributions have same \ufb02uctuations, both need not have identical factorial moments. Figure 4\nshows the plots of FqversuslforAandGTCdistribution for a LAMCG sequence. Since both are complimentary,\nthey have identical \ufb02uctuations at all scales (hence same bending r egion), but the cross over regions in Fqplots are\ndi\ufb00erent, being higher for ATCdistributions (due to large average values n0at all scales). While the lqvalue of the A\ndistribution shows an approximate correlation with the bending regio n of\u03c3versuslplot where a possible slope change\noccurs, the lqvalues of GTCdistribution has no such correlations. This is true for any complemen tary distributions\nofG,A,TandCexcept for GAandTCdistributions since both have nearly same overlapping cross over re gions.\n5\nFIG. 4. The factorial moments FqversuslforGandATCdistributions of LAMCG sequence\nTherefore, only the lqvalues of the G,A,T,CandGAdistributions are used as an approximate length scales\n(lc). The entire length of the sequence is divided into two parts one for 0< l < l c1and other for lc2< l < L max\nwherelc1andlc2are the minimum and maximum of all the lccorresponding to G,A,T,CandGAdistributions.\nTheLmax=L/30, i.e. we have at least 30 independent data sets so that the statis tical analysis becomes meaningful.\nTherefore, excluding the region lc1< l < l c2, we have extracted \u03b11and\u03b12since the linearity in these two segments\nare found to be extremely good for most of the cases. The results are summarized in three tables which covers both\nintronless and intron containing sequences. The table shows the len gth of the sequence Lused in the analyses, the\ncross over values lq( same as lc), the slope parameters \u03b11and\u03b12and also the corresponding percentage of the\nnucleotide contents P. A general observation is that the sequence is weakly correlated a t short distance with \u03b11\nwhich is quite close to 0 .5 where as for l > lc, the correlation is relatively stronger with a larger value of \u03b12. Now we\ndiscuss a few exceptions like in the case of SCMITandPODOT 7 (T7 bacteriophage, 39936 bps). Figure 5 shows\nthe factorial moments of a typical Gdistributions. In both the cases, the factorial moments do not ha ve any cross\nover point. In case of SCMIT, the factorial moments are much higher than unity even at small dis tance and starts\ndecreasing afterwards. The similar behavior is found for Cdistribution also. However, the A,TandGAdistributions\ndo have lcpoints. Therefore, using lc1as\u223c36 andlc2\u223c184, we estimated \u03b11and\u03b12forG,A,T,CandGA\ndistributions which are listed in table III. The symbol\u2032\u2217\u2032indicates absence of any critical value. It is interesting to\nnote that \u03b11is quite large and in some cases \u03b11> \u03b12. On the other hand , the factorial moments of the sequence like\nPODOT 7 do not reach unity at any scale. The absence of such type of scale has been indicated by the symbol\u2032\u2212\u2032\nin table III. This type of sequences behave like a pure random one ha ving\u03b1values quite close to 0 .5. We have listed\na few such sequences with exceptions in table III.\n6\nFIG. 5. The factorial moments FqversuslforGdistributions of SCMIT(scaled up) and PODOT7 (T7 bacteriophage)\nsequences.\nFurther, we would like to mention here that we have noticed that the factorial moments for many sequences starts\ndecreasing at large distances. Also for a few cases, the factorial moments start decreasing even at a very short\ndistances. Consequently, the slope also changes accordingly. How ever, we would not like to assign any reasons due to\nlack of enough statistics.\nThe slope with \u03b1= 0.5 corresponds to the case of a normal di\ufb00usion process of a rando m Brownian trajectory. The\nbasic idea of a Brownian motion is that of a random walk having a Gaussia n distribution probability for the position\nof the random walker after a time twith the variance ( \u03c32) proportional to t(\u03c3\u223ct\u03b1where\u03b1= 0.5). This corresponds\nto the case of normal di\ufb00usion. However, nature shows enough ex amples of anomalous di\ufb00usion characterized by a\nvariance which does not follow a linear growth in time [28]. In such cases either the di\ufb00usion is accelerated if \u03b1 >0.5\nor the growth is dispersive if \u03b1 <0.5. As found in the analyses (see tables I and II), \u03b12>0.5 at large distances for\nmost of the sequences irrespective of their intron contents. How ever, a few sequences as shown in table III, not only\npeculiar, may also have \u03b1which decreases at large distances. In such cases, \u03b1 <0.5 which may indicate the in\ufb02uence\nof dispersive dynamics. This aspect needs further investigations. Finally, we would like to add here that \u03b11is close to\n0.5 for most of the sequences at short distance (see tables I and II ). Although, \u03b1= 0.5 would imply about a random\nbehavior, it can not be told conclusively from the present analyses u nless the short distance e\ufb00ects are taken into\nconsideration [29].\nV. PATCHY SEQUENCES\nIn the following, we investigate whether the mosaic character of DN A consisting of patches of di\ufb00erent composition\ncan account for apparent long range correlations in DNA sequence s [18]. The Charga\ufb00\u2019s second parity rule states\nthat in a single strand G\u2248CandT\u2248A. However, asymmetries in base composition have been observed in m any\nsequences. A quantitative estimate of the GCandATskews can be obtained from the relation ( G\u2212C)/(G+C)\n(Excess of Gnucleotides over Cnucleotides) and ( A\u2212T)/(A+T) (Excess of Anucleotides over Tnucleotides).

We consider LAMCG as an example\nand plot n(de\ufb01ned appropriately) versus l0where the starting position of the sliding window l0varies from 1, 2, 3 etc\n7\nuptoL\u2212l. Figure 6 shows the plots of GCandATskews as a function of the length for a typical LAMCG sequence.\nThe plots show a change in the direction of the slope with a change in sig n of the skew. The quantity and quality of\nthe skew can be assessed from the Vor from the inverted- Vshape of the curves.\nFIG. 6. The GCandATskews as a function of l0forLAMCG sequence.\nFrom the above plots, we can identify three well known compositiona l domains of LAMCG of size 22000 bps ( GA\ncontents 0.54), 17000 bps ( GAcontents 0.47) and 9000 bps ( GAcontents 0.54). We also consider an arti\ufb01cially\ngenerated sequence by joining three random patches of size 2200 0 bps, 17000 bps and 9000 bps respectively with\nappropriate G,A,TandCcontents. We also consider another heterogeneous sequence ge nerated from E.ColiDNA\nby a mobile insertion of TN10 at location 22000 bps. The correspondin g random patches are of size 22000 bps, 9147\nbps and 22000 bps respectively3\n3Please note the distinction between the random sequence whi ch is generated by joining three random patches of total leng th\nLand a pure random one of length L. Although, both the sequence has same percentage of nucleot ide contents in the length\nL, the former is random only patch wise.\n8\nFIG. 7.

Interestingly, the factorial moments f or both the cases behave similarly. Figure 8 shows a\nsimilar\u03c3(l) versuslplot both for real and arti\ufb01cially generated (from random patches ) sequences. Although, in some\ncases both agree, in general they are not identical at the individua l nucleotide levels particularly at large distances\n(Note that the scale is highly compressed). This deviation would mean that at large distances, the density distribution\nfunctions will have signi\ufb01cant discrepancy due to di\ufb00erent widths. S o at a \ufb01rst look from the \u03c3versuslplot, we can\nsay that the actual DNA sequences and the RANDOM patches need not have identical slopes \u03b1(hence the width\n\u03c3) at large distances for all the nucelotides although they agree in so me cases. Even at short distances, although\nthe DNA and the RANDOM sequences have nearly identical width \u03c3, the full shape of the distributions need not be\nidentical. To demonstrate this, we invoke the principle of complimenta ry which was mentioned before.\n9\nFIG. 8. The variance \u03c3versuslforG,A,T,C, andGAdistributions.

Th e three random\npatches are of size 22000 bps, 9147 bps and 22000 bps with appr opriateG,A,TandCcontents.\nFigure 9(a) shows a GandATCdistribution (left most) for a LAMCG sequence at l= 300. Notice that although\n\u03c3versuslplots are identical, i.e. both distributions have same \ufb02uctuations at a ll scales, the distribution functions\nare not same. Such di\ufb00erences are not found for a real random se quence (right most). The middle \ufb01gure corresponds\nto the case of arti\ufb01cially generated random sequence. Although, t he arti\ufb01cially generated sequence mimics the real\nsequence to some extent, it is not fully capable of reproducing the c haracteristic of a real sequence. Figure 9(b) shows\nanother comparison for a E.Coli::TN10 sequence for AandGTCdistributions. This discrepancy will be more\nprominent at higher lvalues which the arti\ufb01cially generated sequence can not reproduce .\nFIG. 9.

(a) for LAMCG and (b) for E.Coli::TN10.\n10\nVI. DENSITY DISTRIBUTIONS\nIn [26], we had demonstrated that the density distribution Pnis Gaussian at short distances and starts deviating\nfrom it as the distance increases. Figure 10 shows another example wherePnhas been plotted for two complimentary\ndistributions at l= 25, 100 and 200 respectively. The complimentary distributions are nearly identical at short\ndistance and coincide with the random distributions where as Pndistributions for G,ATCand pure random one are\nall di\ufb00erent at larger distances.\nFIG. 10. The density distribution Pnversusn\u2212n0(wheren0is average density) for LAMCG sequence at l= 25, 100 and\n200 respectively. The solid and the dashed curves are for GandATCdistributions respectively where as the dotted curve is\nfor a purely random sequence.\nThus, irrespective of intron contents, most of the sequences fo llow Gaussian statistics at short distances. However,\nat large distances, the statistics deviates signi\ufb01cantly from the Ga ussian nature.\nVII. CONCLUSIONS\nIn conclusion, we have extended our previous work to extract the slope parameter \u03b1for several intron containing\nand intron less DNA sequences. The advantage of the present met hod is that the variance analysis can be applied\nto any individual or group of nucleotides. We believe that the individua l nucleotides provide a more fundamental\nmeasure of the correlation than any combination or group (like the D NA walk representation) where the e\ufb00ects may\nget reduced or washed out. Another interesting aspect is the (low er) factorial moments of most of the DNA sequences\ncross unity in a very narrow region in lwhere the \u03c3versuslplot in the log-log scale also shows a bending. Although,\na formal justi\ufb01cation to this correlation has not been provided, we have used this scale as an approximate measure\nto exclude the bending regions from the slope analyses. Based on th is scale, we divide the DNA sequence into two\nsegments to extract the slope parameters. It is found that below this scale, the correlation is weak and the DNA\nstatistics is essentially Gaussian while above this all DNA sequences sh ow strong long range correlations irrespective\nof their intron contents with a signi\ufb01cant deviation from the Gaussia n behavior. It may be mentioned here that the\ncontroversies that exist in this \ufb01eld of research are primarily due to di\ufb00erent approaches that are adopted in various\nmodels. In this context, our analyses is model independent as it only involves the counting of an individual or a group\nof nucleotides in a given length to build the density distribution. In this work, we do not advocate for any speci\ufb01c\nmodel, although the extracted slope parameters indicate the pres ence of anomalous di\ufb00usion of both enhanced and\ndispersive nature. Instead, we provide an elegant tool to measur e the degree of correlations unambiguously so that\nthe interpretation of the data including theoretical analyses will be come more meaningful. This work will also provide\nfurther impetus to develop models for the understanding of the DN A dynamics.\n11\nTABLE I.

This is the case of a correlated random walk and di\ufb00ers\nfrom an uncorrelated walk where the direction of each step is indepe ndent of the previous steps. Further they assign\nui= 1 if a pyrimidine occurs at the site iwhereas ui=\u22121 if the site contains a purine. The net displacement ( y) of\nthe walker after lsteps is de\ufb01ned as\ny(l) =l/summationdisplay\ni=1u(i) (A1)\nThe standard deviation of the above quantity can be estimated fro m\n\u03c32(l,L) =1\nL\u2212lL\u2212l/summationdisplay\nl0=1(\u2206y(l0,l)\u2212\u00af\u2206(l))2(A2)\nwhereLis the number of nucleotides in the entire sequence and\n\u00af\u2206y(l) =1\nL\u2212lL\u2212l/summationdisplay\nl0=1\u2206y(l0,l) (A3)\nwhere \u2206y(l0,l) =y(l0+l)\u2212y(l0). It was found [13] that the \ufb02uctuations can be approximated by\n\u03c3(l,L)\u223cl\u03b1(A4)\nwhere\u03b1is the correlation exponents. For \u03b1close to 0 .5, there is no correlation or only short range correlation in the\nsequence. If \u03b1is signi\ufb01cantly di\ufb00erent from 0 .5, it indicates long range correlations.\nAPPENDIX: B\nIn the previos analyses, we account for the non-occurenceof a p articular nucleotide. This is operationallyequivalent\nto building the density spectrum Pnincluding n= 0. If the nucleotide compositional asymmetry is quite large like\nSCMIT, the occurence ncan be zero for some nucleotides particularly at short distances. T herefore, we can build\nPndistribution either including or excluding zerothchannel. The \ufb01gure B1(a) shows the comparison of \u03c3versusl\nplot for two complimentary distributions corresponding to a LAMCG sequence both with (top panel where Gand\nATCdistributions have identical slopes at all scales) and without (botto m panel) inclusion of n= 0 channel in the\nPnspectra. Interestingly, absence of n= 0 channel does not satisfy the complimentarity relation particular ly at short\ndistances. However, the di\ufb00erence does not exist at larger distan ces where always n >1. Figure B1(b) shows another\nexample of Fqversuslplot for a typical SCMITsequence. The spectrum with exclusion of n= 0 channel behaves\ndi\ufb00erently when zerothchannel is included (compare it with \ufb01gure 5 where Fqversuslhas no cross over).\n15\nFIG. B1. (a) The variance \u03c3versuslforG(solid curves) and ATCdistributions (dotted curves) for LAMCG sequence. Top\npanel is for distribution for which the complimentarity is p reserved while complimentarity is not satis\ufb01ed in the case o f bottom\npanel particularly at small distances. (b) Fqversuslplot forGdistribution of SCMITfor the case when complimentarity is\nnot preserved. The curves are scaled up appropriately for be tter clarity.\nSince the spectrum behaves di\ufb00erently when zerothchannel is not included, we have analysed the spectrum of three\ntypical sequences listed in the table below. Notice now that while \u03b12values are essentially same as before, the \u03b11\nvalues are quite di\ufb00erent. In fact, we have noticed a general tren d where\u03b11is higer than the previous values although\nthe corresponding density distributions do not deviate signi\ufb01cantly from the Gaussian behavior at short distances.\nHowever, in the previous analysis, we alwyas include the zerothchannel so that the complimentarity properties is\nsatis\ufb01ed at all scales. Moreover, we also found a correlation betwe en\u03b1and Gaussian statistics, namely the deviation\nof\u03b1from 0.5 also shows a corresponding deviation of Pndistribution from Gaussian behavior. For example, in case of\nSCMIT, the\u03b1is quite large at a short distance. Accordingly, the Pndistribution also shows strong deviation from\nthe Gaussian statistics. However, this is not necessarilly true when complimentarity is not preserved while building\nthe spectrum. At short distances, the deviation of \u03b1from 0.5 does not always mean a strong deviation from the\nGaussian statistics.\nTABLE IV.

Physikalisches Institut, Universit\u00a8 at Stuttgart, Pfa\ufb00e nwaldring 57, D-70550 Stuttgart, Germany\nA novel THz near-\ufb01eld spectrometer is presented which allow s to perform biological and medical\nstudies with high spectral resolution combined with a spati al resolution down to \u03bb/100. In the\nsetup an aperture much smaller than the used wavelength is pl aced in the beam very close to\nthe sample. The sample is probed by the evanescent wave behin d the aperture. The distance\nis measured extremely accurate by a confocal microscope. We use monochromatic sources which\nprovide powerful coherent cw radiation tuneable from 50 GHz up to 1.5 THz. Transmission and\nre\ufb02ection experiments can be performed which enable us to st udy solids and molecules in aqueous\nsolution. Examples for spectroscopic investigations on bi ological tissues are presented.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nDuring recent years there have been many e\ufb00orts to\nunderstand in detail how cells function. To cope this\ncomplex problem, it is necessary to examine the compo-\nnents of the system, like DNA, bio-molecules, proteins,\ncell-membrans. Due to the large entities and the high\ndensity of electronic, vibrational and rotational states\nin these bio-molecules, spectroscopic investigations in\nthe millimeter, submillimeter, and far-infrared spectral\nrange (often called THz range) seem to be an appro-\npriate method for this task. However, the dimensions\nof the samples under study are rather small, often well\nbelow Abbe\u2019s di\ufb00raction limit, implying that in the mil-\nlimeter to far-infrared spectral range it is not possible to\nperform measurements by standard optical methods. In\naddition to the scienti\ufb01c point of view, the THz range\nof frequency attracts considerable attention because of\npossible applications, in particular with the aim of THz\nimaging. While a number of groups try to peruse time\ndomain technique utilizing short laser pulses in order to\ngenerate a broad spectrum terahertz radiation [1,2], we\nimproved the well developed technique in the frequency\ndomain. Since most biologicaland medical investigations\nwill required measurements of molecules in aqueous solu-\ntion and water is highly absorbing in the THz range, we\nhave developed a re\ufb02ection setup in addition to simple\ntransmission arrangements.\nThe frequency range between microwaves and infrared\nhas proven to be particularly challenging to experimen-\ntalists since it falls right between the range of guided\nwaves (coaxial and microwave technique) and optical\ntechniques (free space propagation). Microwave oscilla-\ntors are in general not tunable over a larger range of fre-\nquency and/or deliver only a very small output power;\nhence they basically cannot be employed above 100 GHz.\nComing from optical methods, standard infrared spec-\ntroscopy using Fourier transform interferometer has tocope with two problems by trying to go to lower fre-\nquencies: (i) the output power of the thermal radiation\nsourcesvanishesfor \u03c9\u21920followingPlanck\u2019slawofblack\nbodyradiation; (ii) the spotsizetowhichthe lightcanbe\nfocusedformeasurementsisdi\ufb00ractionlimitedtoapprox-\nimately the wavelength. Here we present a new approach\nto overcome this limitations by utilizing monochromatic\nbut tunable backward wave oscillators as powerful ra-\ndiation sources and a near-\ufb01eld microscope in order to\nperform microspectrometry in the THz range.\nII.

The coherent radiation generated by backward\nwave oscillators is split by wire grids. The length of the in-\nterference arm can be adjusted by moving mirror 2. After\nthe sample is introduced, the interferometer is readjusted in\norder to obtain the phase di\ufb00erence.\nThe use of backward wave oscillators as radiation\nsources for spectroscopic measurement in the frequency\nrange from 1 cm\u22121to 50 cm\u22121(f= 30 GHz to 1.5 THz;\n\u03bb= 0.2 mm to 10 mm) was developed in the group of\nG. Kozlov during the last twenty years [3,4]. With a\n\u2217To whom correspondence should be addressed (dressel@pi1.p hysik.uni-stuttgart.de)\n1\ncw output power of 1 to 200 mW reliable optical experi-\nments can be performed with a very short data acquisi-\ntion time. The radiation can be tuned in frequency with\nan accuracy and stability of 10\u22126allowing to map very\nnarrow absorption lines. The radiation is detected either\nby a Golay cell or by a silicon bolometer, which is cooled\ndown to 1.2 K. The spectrometer has a dynamical range\nof up to 107. Experiments can be performed either in re-\n\ufb02ection or transmission, where a Mach-Zehnder interfer-\nometer (Fig. 1) also allows to probe the change in phase\nand thus to evaluate the real and imaginary part of the\nelectrodynamic response without performing a Kramers-\nKronig analysis [5]. Since a quasi-optical arrangement is\nlimited by di\ufb00raction and standing-wave problems, sam-\nples smaller than approximately three times the wave-\nlength cannot be investigated.\nIII.

Schematic of the THz near-\ufb01eld spectrometer.\nThe sample is placed in the near-\ufb01eld unit (1); the spectro-\nscopic measurements are done by a coherent source spectrom-\neter (2); the distance control and measurement is done by a\nconfocal micorscope (3).\nThe spectroscopic investigations are done with a co-\nherent source spectrometer similar to the one discribedabove in Sec. II just arranged for re\ufb02ection measure-\nments. The cw beam generated by backward wave oscil-\nlators is mechanically chopped and focussed on the pin-\nhole by te\ufb02on leses. Within a few seconds it can be elec-\ntronically tuned over the full range of the oscillator. The\nre\ufb02ected beam is guided to the bolometer by a wire-grid\nbeam splitter.\n/G31 /G61/G31 /G62 /G31 /G63\n/G31 /G64\n/G31 /G65\nFIG. 3. Schematic of the near-\ufb01eld unit, consisting of pin-\nhole (1a), piezo bender (1b), piezo motors (1c), sample (1d) ,\nand sample holder (1e).\nThe core part of the near-\ufb01eld spectrometer is a small\npinhole(1) which is drilled in a copper foil (thickness 1 to\n10\u00b5m) with diameter as small as 1 \u00b5m and which gen-\nerates the evanescent submillimeter wave the sample is\nprobed with (Fig. 3). Behind the pinhole sits the sample\n(1d) which can be translated relative to the pinhole by\nthree linear piezo-motors (1c). These motors are based\non stick and slip motion with a step size of 40 to 400 nm.\nThere is a fourth motor for moving the sample and pin-\nhole together, which is required for the distance control\nvia the confocal microscope. The distance between pin-\nhole and sample is modulated up to \u00b170\u00b5m with high\nfrequencies (about 1 kHz) by an additional piezo-electric\nbender (1b) in order to using look-in technique for data\nacquisition. The near-\ufb01eld unit is installed on an rotat-\nable frame for performing THz measurements on the one\nside and the distance control on the other side.\nAn accurate distance control is necessary because of\nthe strong dependence of the signal on the distance be-\ntween pinhole and sample. It is performed by a image-\nprocessing confocal microscope [Fig. 2, (3)], which was\ndeveloped by Tiziani et al. [6]. Therefore the light of an\ninfrared LED (3a) is focused on the sample via a rotat-\ning microlens array (3d). The re\ufb02ected light is measured\nby a CCD camera (3h). Because of the low depth of\nfocus, which is produced by the microlens array, the re-\n\ufb02ection has a maximum if the sample sits exactly in the\nfocus of the last lens (3f). By moving pinhole and sample\nrelatively to this lens a three dimensional quantitativ im-\nage originates, from which the distance between pinhole\nand sample can be measured with a precision of 100 nm\nwithin an adequate time.\n2\n0 100 200 300 4000.00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91.0\nMicrowave absorber\non glass\n1\u00b5m Al-layer\non glass\n200\u00b5mreflectivity\nx (\u00b5m)\nFIG. 4.

The pinhole was scanned over an interface\nbetween a microwave absorbing \ufb01lm and a silver \ufb01lm,\nboth deposited on a glass substrate. The increase of re-\n\ufb02ectivity within a width of 200 \u00b5m, which corresponds to\nthe diameter of the pinhole, can clearly be seen. With an\nused frequency of 180 GHz ( \u03bb= 1.7 mm) the near-\ufb01eld\nratio\u03bb/dis about 10. Additional mathematical treat-\nment (deconvolution) can be used to improve the spa-\ntial resolution considerably. Details of the experimental\nsetup will be discussed in [7].\nIV. SPECTROSCOPIC MEASUREMENTS\nDue to the strong dependence of the oscillators\u2019 out-\nput power on the frequency and due to the frequency-\ndependent absorption of the components of the optical\nspectrometer (lenses, grids, ...), measurements of abso-\nlutevalueofthere\ufb02ectivityrequiretoperformareference\nmeasurement on an ideal re\ufb02ecting sample (e.g. a silver\nmirror). If only spectroscopic features have to be identi-\n\ufb01ed, di\ufb00erence spectra are su\ufb03cient which were taken of\ntwo materials, at two di\ufb00erent sample positions, or two\nstates di\ufb00erent in other respect.1a 1.5\n0.60.8Black Forest hamImeat/Ifat\n6.06.57.07.58.00.1110\nb\n frequency [cm-1]Chicken bone Ibone/Icartilage\nFIG. 5. Spectra of two biological samples: a) The solid\nline shows the re\ufb02ectivity of the meat part normalized on the\nre\ufb02ectivity of the fat part of Black Forest ham, averaged on\nthree points each. b) Ratio of the re\ufb02ected power of chicken\nbone and of chicken cartilage. The dotted lines demonstrate s\nthe reproducibility by the 100% line of the spectrometer.\nEmploying this near-\ufb01eld re\ufb02ection spectrometer, we\nhave performed investigations on a variety of biological\nand medical samples. As an example Fig. 5a exhibits the\nre\ufb02ectivity of the meat part of Black Forest Ham rela-\ntive to the fat part in the frequency range from 5.5 cm\u22121\nto 8.5 cm\u22121. The circular pinhole used was 200 \u00b5m in\ndiameter in a 10 \u00b5m thick copper foil. The distance\nbetween pinhole and sample was 3.0 \u00b5m. To rule out\ninhomogeneities of the sample we performed three mea-\nsurements on di\ufb00erent the meat part as well as on the fat\npart and averagedthem. The reproducibility of the main\nfeatures and the homogeneity of the sample are demon-\nstrated by dividing data sets taken at di\ufb00erent positions,\nideally leading to a 100% line (dotted line). The spectro-\nscopic distinction between meat and fat become obvious\nwhen the ratio of the spectra is plotted (solid line).\nSimilar experiments have been performed on chicken\nbone which has a much lower water content and thus a\nsmaller re\ufb02ection coe\ufb03cient. Fig. 5b shows the ratio of\nthe the re\ufb02ected power of the bone and of the cartilage.\nAgain the spatial resolution is less than 200 \u00b5m.\n3\nV. SPECTROSCOPIC IMAGING\nIn both spectra we \ufb01nd unexpectedly sharp and strong\nfeatures; in certain ranges the re\ufb02ected power is 5 times\nas high in cartilage compared to the chicken bone, for\ninstance. This indicates strong absorption lines which\nmay serve as a spectroscopic signature of the material.\nWhile at presence we cannot reliably assign the lines,\nwe already want to note the possibility of using these\nlarge di\ufb00erences for imaging. Di\ufb00erential images may\nbe a very sensitive tool to probe the spatial distribution\nof certain molecules with a resolution in the microme-\nter range. For this purpose only two distinct frequencies\nhave to be measured which is easily possible by our spec-\ntrometer and which reduces the measurements time by\norders of magnitude. This technique allows to selectively\nmap out the composition of samples.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nWe have developed a new microspectrometer to per-\nform spectroscopic experiments in the THz range with a\nlarge frequency resolution of 107. The use of near-\ufb01eld\ntechnique enables us to obtain a spatial resolution down\nto several micrometers. With a re\ufb02ection setup we can\ninvestigate biological samples in aqueous solution. The\ninstrument also provides spectro-images which show the\nspatial distribution of biological molecules with a high\nspatial resolution. This novel technique has an enormous\npotential for a variety of biological and medical applica-\ntions.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis study has been carried out with \ufb01nancial sup-\nportfromtheCommissionoftheEuropeanCommunities,\nspeci\ufb01c RTD program \u2018Quality of Life and Management\nof Living Resources\u2019, QLK4-CT-2000-00129 \u201cTera-Hertz\nRadiation In Biological Research, Investigation on Diag-\nnostics and Study on Potential Genotoxic E\ufb00ects\u201d.

A protein can fo ld itself to its uniquely\nwell-de\ufb01ned native structure in a biologically short time, regardless o f the huge number of\npossible conformations, showing a highly cooperatively kinetic behav ior. It is now clear that\nthecooperativityoffoldingmay result fromthebackbone hydroge nbonding, sidechain pack-\ning and hydrophobic interactions, among them the hydrophobic inte ractions are believed to\nbe the dominant driving force for folding [2]. For many small single-dom ain proteins or\nlattice proteinlike models, there is a two-state behavior between th e unfolded states and the\nfolded native one [3,4]. Recently, Chan and Kaya [5] indicated that acc ording to the calori-\nmetric criterion, which is widely used in experiments as a condition for t wo-state folding,\npopular lattice models, e.g., two-letter HP and 20-letter MJ models, a re far from two-state\nmodels. Thismay beduetosome \ufb02awed assumptions inthepotentialf unctions usedinthese\nmodels. Lattice models usually use statistical potential functions e xtracted from the pair-\ning frequencies of 20 kinds of amino acids in databases of protein str uctures [6]. Although\nthese knowledge-based potentials may be a good approximation to t he relative strength of\ninteractions between the residues in the native state, they provid e no information about\nhow the interactions evolve during the folding. For computational c onvenience, a common\nassumption in lattice models is that the interactions are additive, and they are the same\nduring the folding as in the native state. This means that the interac tion energies are\nconformation-independent. Clearly this is not relevant to the expe rimental situation [7]. In\nfact, as Dill pointed out [8], the thermodynamic additivity principle whic h is widely used in\nchemistry may be unsuitable in biochemistry. Some recent experimen ts also indicated that\nthe transition state is an expanded version of the native state, wh ere the majority of inter-\nactions are partially formed [9], and their strengths are di\ufb00erent fr om those in the native\nstate (with \u03a6 <1). That is, these interactions depend on the conformations [7], es pecially\nthe local structures around the contacts as emphasized recent ly in Ref. [10]. Previously, the\nnon-additivity was built in a lattice model for packing e\ufb00ects [11]; and t he hydrophobic force\ndepending on the local density of peptide atoms was also taken into a ccount in an o\ufb00-lattice\n2\nmodel [12]. Studies on these models show that the introduction of th e non-additivity is\nsigni\ufb01ciant, but the two-state cooperativity of these models is not checked, and the e\ufb00ects\nof the non-additivity on thermodynamics and kinetics of folding need to be further studied.\nIn this paper, we develop a re\ufb01ned G\u00af o model where the pairwise inte raction energies\nvary as the local environment changes, i.e., some kinds of collective e \ufb00ects between contacts\nare introduced. Our purpose here is to study the two-state coop erativity of protein folding\nand its physical origin with such a model. Our results give a general pic ture about how the\nconformation-dependent interactions a\ufb00ect the folding kinetics, which is consistent with the\nphenomenological explanation based on experimental results.\nWe model a polypeptide chain as a self-avoiding chain on a cubic lattice. A contact is\nformed if two residues are space adjacent but not sequence adja cent. If two residues form a\ncontact as the same as in the native state, we call this contact a na tive contact, otherwise\na non-native contact. Following the G\u00af o model [13], only native conta cts are considered to\ncontribute to the total energy. Di\ufb00erent from the G\u00af o model, we a ssume that the interaction\nenergies between residues are conformation-dependent, and va ry with changes of the local\nenvironment. Toachieve this, weintroduceaparameter Stodescribethedegreeforaresidue\nbeing ordered relative to the native state. For the i-th residue in a certain conformation, its\ndegree of order Siis de\ufb01ned as\nSi=zi/znat\ni, (1)\nwhereziis the number of native contacts in this conformation, znat\niis the number of contacts\nformed in the native state. Obviously, Sivaries between 0 (the i-th residue being fully\ndisordered) and 1 (being fully ordered). Thus, the interaction ene rgy between residues iand\nj,Bij=-(Si+Sj)\u03b5/2 is de\ufb01ned, where SiandSjare the degrees of order for residues iandj,\nrespectively. \u03b5is the unit of energy and is set to be 1 in this work. The total energy o f the\nconformation then is E=/summationtext\ni<j\u2206ijBij, where \u2206 is unity when residues iandjform a native\ncontact, and zero otherwise. Here, a contact formed between r esiduesiandjmay have\ndi\ufb00erent energies in di\ufb00erent conformations, i.e., Bijmay change from one conformation to\n3\nanother (for the G\u00af o model, one always has Bij=\u2212\u03b5). In general, a contact formed between\nresidues iandjwill stabilize, to some extent, other contacts that residue iorjformed\nwith other residues. On the contrary, its breakage may destabilize those contacts as well.\nTherefore, the introduction of the degree of order for a residue into the potential function\nre\ufb02ects the cooperativity between the residues. Although the co rrelation distance is small,\nonly one lattice unit, the many-body e\ufb00ects are obviously included in o ur model. Figure 1\nshows such a collective e\ufb00ect. The interaction energies of contact A-B (or B-C) are di\ufb00erent\nwhen the other contact is present or not present. Clearly, the en ergy of state I3is lower than\nthe sum of that of states I1andI2, indicating the interaction non-additivity. Each contact\nis stabilized by the other contact due to the collective e\ufb00ect. Note t hat in this paper our\nmodel is called G\u00af o+ model to distinguish from the G\u00af o model.\nNow let us present the Monte Carlo simulations on the thermodynamic and kinetic\nfeatures for both models. The mean \ufb01rst passage time (MFPT), as a common measure of\nfolding rate, is calculated by an average of the \ufb01rst passage time (F PT) over 1000 runs.\nEach run begins with a random conformation, and ends when the nat ive state is reached for\nthe \ufb01rst time. The FPT is the Monte Carlo steps (MCS) consumed in a r un.\nGenerally, as the temperature Tdecreases, the population of the native state, PN, in-\ncreases from zero to about unity. The degree of sharpness of ch anges in PN, similar to the\n\u201crapidity\u201d in Ref. [14], is a measure of the cooperativity of the folding reaction. Figure 2\nshows the population PNand the speci\ufb01c heat Cvversus temperature Tfor a 36-mer chain\nfor both models. PNis de\ufb01ned as PN=e\u2212EN/T//summationtext\nE\u2126(E)e\u2212E/T, where \u2126( E) is the density\nof states for energy E,ENis the energy of the native state. \u2126( E) is calculated with the\nMonte Carlo histogram method [15]. From Fig.2 we can see that the fold ing transition for\nour G\u00af o+ model is much sharper than that of the G\u00af o model, i.e., a sha rper change in PN.\nThere is also a single peak in Cvcurve, but it is narrower than that of the G\u00af o model. For\nour G\u00af o+ model, the maximum of Cvoccurs at a temperature nearly the midpoint tempera-\nture of transition with PN=1/2, i.e., the di\ufb00erence between these two temperatures is quite\nsmall. This is consistent with recent studies on naturally occuring pro teins [14,16], implying\n4\na good cooperativity of folding in this model. Di\ufb00erently, such a tempe rature di\ufb00erence is\nlarge for the G\u00af o model (see Fig.2), indicating that the folding of the G\u00af o model is much less\ncooperative than that of the G\u00af o+ model. Since the sharpness is on ly a qualitative descrip-\ntion for the transition, we further calculate the equilibrium energy d istribution at the folding\ntransition temperature, Tf. Figure 3 shows such distributions for both models. Clearly our\nG\u00af o+ model shows a goodbimodal behavior, and the denatured-st ate energy is distributed in\na narrow region [see Fig. 3(a)]. This means clearly a two-state folding and there is basically\nno intermediate states at equilibrium. Di\ufb00erently, for the G\u00af o model as shown in Fig. 3(b),\nthere are many intermediate states and the bimodal behavior is not so signi\ufb01cant as that in\nFig.3(a). Thus for the G\u00af o model the folding is not of a two-state. T his is in agreement with\nChan and Kaya\u2019s argument [5].\nIn experiments, a well-established criterion for two-state folding is that the van\u2019t Ho\ufb00\nenthalpy \u2206 HvHaround the transition midpoint is equal, or very close, to the calorime tric\nenthalpy \u2206 Hcalof the entire transition. In this work, we calculate the ratio \u2206 HvH/\u2206Hcalas\nsuggested in Ref. [5] (here, the de\ufb01nition of \u2206 HvH/\u2206Hcalis equal to ( k2)2in Ref. [5]), and\nlist the results in Table I. From Table I, we can clearly see the di\ufb00erenc e between the G\u00af o\nmodel and our G\u00af o+ model. The G\u00af o model, which is considered as a mod el with minimal\nenergetic frustrations, does not meet the calorimetric two-stat e criterion and gives out the\nvalue of \u2206 HvH/\u2206Hcalfar from 1. Nevertheless, our model satis\ufb01es the criterion quite w ell\n(for real proteins, the value of \u2206 HvH/\u2206Hcalis 0.96\u00b10.03 [17]). This, again, implies the\ntwo-state folding and the good cooperativity of our G\u00af o+ model.\nPhysically, thehighcooperativityofourmodelmayresult fromthen arrowdistributionof\nthe denatured states and the high population of the native state a t the folding temperature\n(see also Figs.2 and 3). In our model, the energy spectrum relating t o various conformations\nis redistributed, comparing with that of the G\u00af o model, due to the co llective e\ufb00ect between\ninteractions. As a result, the energies of non-native conformatio ns are moved to higher\nenergy levels and a larger energy gap is left between the non-native conformations and the\nnative one (for the two models, the energies of the native state ar e the same). The large\n5\nenergy gap makes the native state paticularly stable, which is believe d to be a necessary\ncondition for cooperative folding [18]. This may be the physical origin o f the two-state\ncooperativity. It can be further explained from the viewpoint of th e free energy pro\ufb01le. For\nour G\u00af o+ model, as shown in Fig.4, the free energy pro\ufb01les have broa d activation barriers.\nThe broad activation barriers can account for the large movement of transition state caused\nby mutation or temperature changes, and are considered as a com mon feature of the two-\nstate folding [19]. Our numerical results are surprisingly consistent with a phenomenological\nspeculation for the existence of such a free energy pro\ufb01le in Ref. [1 9]. It should be noted that\nthe broad activation barriers are consistent with the narrow distr ibution of the denatured\nstates.\nNow let us make a comparison of the foldability based on the plots of th e MFPT versus\nPNfor both models. Note that we use PNinstead of the commonly used temperature T\nin the horizontal axis in Fig.5. This is because that an identical conditio n should be taken\nfor the comparison. In lattice simulations, the temperature has an arbitrary unit and also\nhas no direct relationship with the real temperature. The comparis on between two di\ufb00erent\nmodels at the same temperature may make no sense. Nevertheless , at an identical condition\nwith the same PN, the di\ufb00erences in the foldability can be well-de\ufb01ned. This is similar to\nother conditions used previously [20]. From Fig. 5, we can see that th e MFPT for our G\u00af o+\nmodel shows a slow decrease as PNincreases, it reaches a minimum at PN\u22480.93, and then\nit increases. For the G\u00af o model, there is also a minimum but at PN\u22480.71. It is clearly\nthat when the native state is stable (say, PN\u22650.9), our G\u00af o+ model folds signi\ufb01cantly fast,\ni.e., the MFPT is smaller with one or two orders of magnitude than that o f the G\u00af o model.\nPhysically, this can be explained as follows. From Eq.(1) we can easily se e that the energy\ngain of forming a contact is usually smaller for our G\u00af o+ model than th at for the G\u00af o model.\nAt high temperatures, entropic contribution is dominant to the fre e energy barrier, and\nthe loss of entropy is always undercompensated by the energy gain , thus the G\u00af o+ model\nfolds slower for its smaller energy gain. Whereas at low temperature s, folding is nearly a\ndownhill process, and the loss of entropy is always overcompensat ed by the energy gain.\n6\nTherefore, for the G\u00af o+ model, it is easier to escape from kinetic tr aps, and the folding is\nfaster. Finally, we note that for the two models the pathways of re aching the transition state\nfrom the denatured state are di\ufb00erent. Due to the high cooperat ivity in our G\u00af o+ model, a\ngood core, the assembly of non-polar residues, is formed much ear lier at low temperatures\nthan that in the G\u00af o model. Detailed kinetic results will be reported els ewhere. We also note\nthat similar results are obtained for di\ufb00erent chain sizes.\nIn conclusion, our G\u00af o+ model, with many-body interactions depend ing on the local\nstructures included, exhibits a good two-state folding behavior. O ur results suggest that\nthe evolution of interactions during the folding plays an important ro le in the two-state\ncooperativity in protein folding. We give a possible way how the interac tions evolve in\nthe folding, which may capture some essential features of the two -state folding. We expect\nfurther study could provide new insights into the mechanism of prot ein folding.\nWe thank H.S. Chan, A. Maritan and D. Thirumalai for useful sugges tions.

These cellular structures are s tudied as topological trees rooted on\na central cell or as closed shells arranged concentrically a round a germ cell. We single out the\nmost signi\ufb01cant parameters that characterize statistical ly the organization of these patterns.\nUniversality and speci\ufb01city in disordered cellular struct ures are discussed.\nPACS numbers: 82.70Rr, 02.50.-r, 05.07.Ln\n1 Introduction\nCellularstructures, space-\ufb01llingdisorderedpatterns, arewidesp readin nature [1, 2, 3]. In an ordered\nstructure, one must constrain the elementary bricks (or group o f them) to satisfy the local rotational\nsymmetry compatible with translational invariance. By contrast, a disordered structure is free\nof any local symmetry constraint, and only subjected to the inesc apable, topological condition\nof partitioning space. In two dimensions, these structures (frot hs) are partitions of the plane by\nirregular polygons. Disorder, or absence of symmetry, imposes min imal incidence numbers (3 edges\nincident on a vertex, 2 faces incident on a edge). The Four-Corner boundary between the States\nof Arizona, Utah, Colorado and New Mexico is a decision made in Washing ton; it has nothing\nto do with population dynamics or with agricultural e\ufb03ciency. It is neit her topologically, nor\nstructurally stable: a small deformation splits it into two topologically stable three-State vertices,\nfound everywhere else on Earth.\nThe setofallthe possiblecon\ufb01gurationsofafrothcanbe explored byelementary, localtopological\ntransformations [4] which, in two dimensions, are: T1, exchange of neighbours (for example, a \ufb02ip\nbetweenthestablealternativesofUT-NMorofAZ-COasneighbour s,abouttheunstablefour-corner\nboundary); T2, disappearance (or apparition) of a triangular cell into a single vert ex. Two alterna-\ntive, equivalent transformations are the cell-division (called mitosis in biology) and cell-coalescence.\nIt can be easily seen (\ufb01g.1) that local, speci\ufb01c combinations of division and coalescence generate\nthe two elementary transformation T1 and T2, and vice versa. The se elementary, local topological\ntransformations are observed in all natural foams, soap froths , metallurgical grain aggregates, but\nalso in biological tissues (epidermis) [5] or in the cellular networks prod uced by B\u00b4 enard-Marangoni\nconvection, whether in the laboratory or on the surface of the su n (solar granulation) [2, 3].\nIn in\ufb01nite two dimensional (2D) Euclidean froths (or froths with per iodic boundary conditions),\nthe average number of neighbours per cell is \ufb01xed by the Euler relat ion to be equal to 6 [2]. Given a\ncell with nedges, the quantity q= 6\u2212nis called its topological charge. The sum of the charges of\nthe cells overthe whole in\ufb01nite Euclidean froth must be equalto zero . The topologicalchargecannot\nbe generated or destroyed. It is just shu\ufb04ed in between cells by th e topological transformations.\nIn this paper, extensive computer simulation are performed to obt ain disordered systems with\nmore than 105cells generated from an hexagonal lattice and applying at random eit her only T1, or\nT1 and T2, or cell-division and coalescence transformations. In the se simulated froths, we forbid\n1\nFigure 1: A froth is a cellular network generated or transformed by successive applications of two\nlocal elementary transformations: T1 (neighbours exchange), a nd T2 (triangular) cell disappearance\n(a). These two transformations can also be regarded as combinations (c)of cell division and cell\ncoalescence (b).\ncon\ufb01gurations with cells which are neighbours of themselves and cells with two edges. The typical\nresulting structures are shown in \ufb01g.2.\nThe structural organizationofthese computer-generatedfro ths arestudied in terms ofthe relative\ndistances between cells. Two di\ufb00erent topological distances can be introduced: the bond distance [6,\n7] andthe shell distance [8,9, 10,11](section2). Thesetwodistancesaredi\ufb00erent: the b onddistance\nis de\ufb01ned on the graph of the froth; the shell distance is best de\ufb01n ed on its dual triangulation. They\nare associated with the number of edges (or vertices) of the shor test paths between two cells. The\nrelationbetween the two distancesis verycomplex and stronglydep endent onthe froth organization,\nbecause they involve minimal paths.\nThe characterization of a disordered structure is a di\ufb03cult task. T he absence of translational\norder or repetitive local con\ufb01guration makes in principle necessary to know the position, size and\nshapeofeverycellin ordertocompletely characterizethe struct ure. But, disordermakesmostofthis\ndetailed local information unimportant. The physical properties of the froth must be describable\nin terms of macroscopic statistical information. A simple and powerf ul way to study disordered\ncellular systems, is to analyze the structure as organized around a given arbitrary central cell. The\ninformation about the structure can be obtained in terms of the pr operties of the set of cells at\nthe a given distance (bound or shell) from the central cell. We show t hat the classi\ufb01cation by\nbond distances reduces the froth to a set of trees rooted on the vertices of an arbitrary central\ncell (see \ufb01g.3). On the other hand, in terms of shell distance, the f roth can be seen has a set of\n2\nFigure 2: Typical topological froths generated by: (a)Cell division and coalescence; (b)T1 trans-\nformations only; (c)T1 and T2 transformations.\nclosed layers of cells arranged concentrically around the central c ell (see \ufb01g.4). This classi\ufb01cation\nin terms of distances naturally introduces a structure and a hierar chy in the froth. Moreover, a\nphysical meaning is directly associated to the sets of equally-distan t cells: any perturbation, signal\nor information propagates from a given cell to the whole froth thro ugh these structures and cells at\nthe same distance are those reached -on average- at the same tim e and with equal intensity by the\nsignal. They are the successive wave fronts of the signal in the fro th.\n2 Topological structure of a froth\nTopological distances\nConsider two cells in a froth. These cells are connected by many path s along the edges of the\ndirect graph or of its dual triangulation. Two di\ufb00erent topological d istances can be associated with\nminimal paths:\nThe bond distance , is the minimum number ofedgesnecessaryto connect two cells in the direct\ngraph of the froth.1. (The concepts of bond distance and of bond neighbours was \ufb01rst introduced\nby one of the authors [6], who called them T1 distance and T1 neighbou rs, respectively [7].)\nThe shell distance (or simply, topological distance [11]), is the minimum number of edges\nconnecting the centers of two cells in the dual triangulation.2\nAll the cells in the froth can be classi\ufb01ed in terms of distances (bond & shell) with respect to a given\n\u201ccentral\u201d cell.\nWe denote by Ftthe number of cells which are at a bond distance tand byKjthe number of cells\nwhich are at a shell distance jfrom a given central cell. These quantities are in generaldependen t on\nthe number of edges nof the central cell. For any froth on the Euclidean plane, FtandKjincrease\nwith the respective distances. But the rates of growth are chara cteristics of a speci\ufb01c cellular system\nand are good, sensitive quantities to characterize its disorder (se e section 4 and [12, 13]).\n1This path is a set adjacent edges ( \u2018bonds\u2019) connecting the two cells.\n2The set of equidistant cells makes a closed layer around the c entral cell, and successive layers form concentric\nrings. The edges separating two successive layers form a clo sed loop: the \u2018shell\u2019[11].\n3\nFigure 3: (a)The forest of n bond trees. (b)In a tree, any vertex at distance tis connected with\none bond to a vertex at distance t\u22121. Two of the three cells incident on a vertex at distance tare\nalso incident on a vertex at distance t\u22121. The mean vertex connectivity ( zt) tends asymptotically\nto 2, which is typical of a tree structure spanning vertices distribu ted uniformly (see also \ufb01g.12). In\n(c)vertices with connectivity z= 1 andz= 3 are labelled with white and black circles respectivelly.\nThe n rooted bond trees\nAssociated with the bond distance, there is a spanning forest of n t rees rooted on the central cell\nand reaching every vertex of the froth in the least number of step s . These trees are the minimal\nbond paths which join the vertices of the froth with the central ce ll. Consider a vertex of the froth\nat a large bond distance t. It has 3 neighbouring vertices, with at least one at a distance t\u22121. Select\none of them and connect it with a bond. The other neighbouring vertex at t\u22121 (if there is one) is\nleft unconnected. Continue down in distances until a vertex of the central cell is reached. This is\ntherootof the tree, which, at this stage, is simply a branch (chain) of tbonds. Then, begin again\nwith another vertex at distance t, down in distances. This second t-branch either meets the \ufb01rst at\nsome point, or it reaches another root (vertex of the central ce ll). Proceed successively with every\nvertex at distance t, down in distances until the branch connects another branch or is rooted into\nthe central cell. Consider then the vertices at distance t\u22121 which have not yet been reached by the\nbranches already constructed, and repeat the operations abov e. By repeating the process to all the\nvertices yet unspanned at distances t,t\u22121,t\u22122,....,2, 1, 0, we generate a forest of ntrees, where n\nis the number of vertices (and of edges) of the central cell. These trees are rooted on the central cell\nand span all the vertices of the froth. Fig.3 (a) shows a forest of t rees up to distance 3. Each vertex\nin the tree has connectivity 2 \u2264z\u22643, except the root and branch ends which have connectivity\n1 (zero if the tree consists of its root vertex only, as happens, fo r example, if the central cell has a\n3-cell as topological neighbour). Call ztthe average vertex connectivity at distance t(1\u2264zt\u22643\n4\nFigure 4: The shell structure.

It follows immediatelly that Vt+1= (zt\u22121)VtandV1=z0V0=z0n. The\nnumber of vertices at distance t >1 is therefore related to the number of edges of the central cell\n(n)\nVt=/bracketleftBig\nz0t\u22121/productdisplay\ni=1(zi\u22121)/bracketrightBig\nn . (1)\nThe bond distance associated to a cell is the bond distance of its ver tex nearest to the central\ncell. Consider a vertex at distance t. It has 3 incident cells. Two must also be incident on a vertex\nat distance t\u22121 (they are separated by the bond linking vertex tto vertex t\u22121, see \ufb01g.3(b) ).\nTherefore, to each vertex at a given distance, there correspon ds no more than one cell at the same\ndistance, i.e. Ft=\u03bdtVtwith\u03bdt\u22641. In 2D Euclidean froths, a cell has 6 vertices on average, and 3\ncells are incident on any vertex. Therefore we expect \u03bd\u22430.5 on average.\nA special case is the hexagonal lattice where there are 6 vertices a nd 6 cells at distance t= 1, 12\nvertices and 6 cells at t= 2, 12 vertices and 12 cells at t= 3, and, in general Vt=Ft= 3(t+ 1)\nfortodd and Vt= 3(t+ 2) and Ft= 6 forteven. We have therefore \u03bdt= 0.5 on average, with\n\u03bdt= 1 when tis odd and \u03bdt= 0 when tis even. This di\ufb00erence between even and odd distances is\ncharacteristic of the hexagonal lattice. When the froth is disorde red, this di\ufb00erence between even\nand odd distances disappears and, asymptotically, the quantities VtandFtgrow linearly with the\ndistance twith\u03bdt\u22430.5. The growth law depends on the speci\ufb01c system and it is studied in se ction\n3 and 4.\nThe shell structure\nThe structure associated with the shell distance for a typical fro th is shown in \ufb01g.4. The shell\ndistance foliates the froth into successive layers of cells surround ing the central cell. Most cells at a\n5\nFigure 5: The shortest bond path crosses at least tmin= 2j\u22123 vertices to connect the central cell\nwith a cell in the layer j.\n(shell) distance jfrom the central cell have neighbours at distances j\u22121,jandj+1. They belong\nto layer ( j). In addition, some cells at distance j(hatched in Fig.4) have neighbours at distances\nj\u22121 andjonly. These cells are local defectinclusions, intercalated between layers ( j\u22121) and (j).\nIn this paper we characterize the shell structure by the number o f cells at distance j,Kj(n),\naveraged over all n-sided central cells. In the perfect honeycomb (hexagonal frot h),Kj= 6j, there\nare no defects, and the successive layers have an hexagonal sha pe. In a random froth, the layers are\nroughly circular, but wiggly. At large distances, Kj(n) is larger than for the honeycomb, but still\nincreases linearly with the distance. The rate of increase is related t o the degree of disorder and to\nthe number of topological defects in the system [12].\nThe combined structure\nThe quantities FtandKjare both radial properties with the angular dependence averaged out.\nIn order to extract information on the angular \ufb02uctuations, it is int eresting to study the interplay\nbetween bond and shell structures. A bond tree develops radially o utward from the central cell\nalong edges which are perpendicular to the shells and it broadens side ways along edges parallel to\nthe shells. The distribution in the bond tree of edges parallel to the s hells gives therefore a measure\nof its spread. Call N(j,t) the number of couples of cells that are simultaneously at a shell dist ancej\nand at a bond distance tfrom each other. (Clearly,/summationtext\ntN(j,t) =KjNand/summationtext\njN(j,t) =FtN, with\nNthe total number of cells in the system.)\nTo calculate N(j,t), let one of the cells be the central cell. The other cell is at shell dist ancej.\nWhat is the bond distance tbetween the two cells? It is readily seen (Fig.5) that at least 2 bonds\nare necessary to go from one layer to the next. Thus, tmin= 2j\u22123 =tRforj\u22652. Therefore, tRis\nthe radial component of the bond distance. (In an hexagonal fro th,t=tR, forj\u22652.)\nIn disordered froths, the bond distance tis, in general, much larger than tR. Suppose, for\ninstance, that a path takes in average \u221dangbracketleftv\u221dangbracketrightextra bonds from one layer to the next. These extra bonds\ncorrespond to segments of the bond tree parallel to the shell and also to extra vertices associated\nto the topological defects between the shells. From the central c ell to a cell at distance j, there\nare\u221dangbracketleftv\u221dangbracketright(j\u22121) additional bonds and the total bond distance is therefore t=tR+\u221dangbracketleftv\u221dangbracketright(j\u22121) =\n(2 +\u221dangbracketleftv\u221dangbracketright)j\u22123\u2212 \u221dangbracketleftv\u221dangbracketright. The number vof extra bonds between layers is a random variable with\nprobability distribution w(v) and mean \u221dangbracketleftv\u221dangbracketright. When w(v) is Poissonian, the conditional probability\nP(t|j) of \ufb01nding a cell at a bond distance t, given that it lies at a shell distance j, is a shifted\n6\nn0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20p(n)\n0.000.050.100.150.200.250.300.350.40\nFigure 6: Distribution of the number of edges per cell in the froth ge nerated by applying cell-division\nand coalescence transformations (C-D simulation).\nPoissonian with average \u00aft=\u221dangbracketleftv\u221dangbracketright(j\u22121)+2j\u22123 and variance \u03c32=\u221dangbracketleftv\u221dangbracketright(j\u22121) (see appendix A).

Then, a cell chosen at random, is divided in two parts (mitos is) if it has more than 6 sides\nor fused by coalescence with one of its neighbours if has less than 6 s ides. If it has six sides, it is\ndivided with probability pd= 1/4 or left unchanged with probability 1 \u2212pd= 3/4. The coalescence\nis performed between the cell and one of its neighbours chosen at r andom. We chose a symmetric\nmode of division: the two \u201cdaughters\u201d of an n-sided \u201cmother\u201d cell have both 2 + n/2 edges for n\neven, and 2 + ( n+ 1)/2 and 2 + ( n\u22121)/2 edges if nis odd (which one has which is assigned at\nrandom).\nAfter iterating the coalescence-division operations for 10 N0times, the resulting structure (shown\nin \ufb01g.2(a)) reaches a stationary number of N= 114475 cells.

The second\nmoment of the distribution is \u00b52= 1.77, and the Aboav-Weaire parameter [2, 14, 15] is a= 0.64.\nThis distribution is stationary under further division-coalescence t ransformations. It is also in-\ndependent of the initial con\ufb01guration. We have obtained statistica lly identical froths starting from\nthe hexagonal lattice ( \u00b52= 0) or from a very disordered froth with \u00b52>10. In the \ufb01rst case, the\nsystem evolves from order to disorder during the simulation. By con trast, in the second case, the\ndisorder of the system decreases throughout the simulation (see \ufb01g.7). This is an example of self\norganization induced by local random transformations only. The dis tribution p(n) reaches a steady\nstate, regardless of the parameter pdwhich controls the fate of 6-sided cells. However, the number\nof cells is very sensitive to pd. Forpd= 1/4, once the steady state is reached, the number of cells\nin the froth remains also stable. But, when pd= 0, the number of cells in the system decreases,\nwhereas, when pd= 1/2, it increases.\nRandom T1 (T1 simulation)\nAn hexagonal lattice of N= 100172 cells and periodic boundary conditions is disordered by \ufb02ippin g\n(T1 transformation) 10 Nedges chosen at random. (Note that the T1 transformation cons erves\nthe total number of cells in the system.) If the chosen edge is bound ing a triangular cell, the T1\ntransformation is refused (lest it would generate a cell with two side s). The probability for a T1 to\nbe refused increases during the disordering process, it reaches t he value of 0.21 at the end of the\nsimulation.\nA typical cellular system obtained with this simulation is shown in \ufb01g.(2b) . Fig.8 shows the\nprobability distribution p(n) for this froth.

The average number of sides per cell is equal to 6 (as imposed by\nthe Euler theorem [2]) but the distribution is an exponential with a max imum at n= 3,p(n) =\np3exp[\u2212\u03b1(n\u22123)] with p3= 0.27 and\u03b1= 0.30. In this simulation, most of the cells are triangles\nbecause it is easier to generate a triangular cell than to make it gain a n edge by random T1.\nRandom T1 and T2 (T1-T2 simulation)\nIn this type of simulation, a \ufb02ip (T1 transformation) is performed on any edge chosen at random,\nexcept if the edge is bounding a triangular cell. In this case, the trian gular cell is made to disappear\n(T2 transformation). For this reason, the number of cells decrea ses during the simulation. We found\nthat, when 5 N0transformations are applied on an initially hexagonal lattice of N0cells, the number\nof cells is reduced by half. But 10 N0transformations are more than enough to reduce the froth to\n3 (hexagonal) cells only. This is the minimum possible number of cells for a froth tiling a torus.\nHere each cell has 2 neighbours and 6 edges and they are arranged as shown in \ufb01g.10. Note that, for\nthis con\ufb01guration, there are two families of closed paths of only 4 ed ges, not bounding a cell, that\nwind around the torus. No further T1 or T2 transformations can b e applied on this \ufb01nal, minimal\ncon\ufb01guration without generating a cell that is neighbour of itself.\nThis simulation started with an hexagonal lattice of N0= 250000 cells on which we applied 5 N0\nof T1 or T2 transformations on edges chosen at random. The resu lting structure had a number of\ncellsN= 115149. A typical froth generated by T1-T2 transformations is shown in \ufb01g.2(c). The\nprobability distribution p(n) is plotted in \ufb01g.9. It is quasi-stationary (until the system is close to\nits \ufb01nal con\ufb01guration of 6 hexagonal cell). It has a maximum in n= 4 and then decreases with\nan exponential tail p(n) =p4exp[\u2212\u03b1(n\u22124)] with p4= 0.84 and\u03b1= 0.53, forn >7. The second\nmoment is \u00b52= 6.33 and the Aboav-Weaire parameter is a= 0.05.\n9\nn0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20p(n)\n0.000.050.100.150.20\nFigure 9: Distribution of the number of edges per cell in the froth ge nerated by T1 and T2 trans-\nformations (T1-T2 simulation).\n4 Results and Discussion\nForeachsimulation,thecellularsystemsarecharacterizedbythen umberofcellsintheshellstructure\n(Kj), in the bond trees ( Ft) and in the combined structure ( N(j,t)), at the respective distances j\nandtof the central cell.

For the three sets of simulations, \u221dangbracketleftFt\u221dangbracketrightincreases linearly with the distance as\nt\u2192 \u221e, with a slope 3 .577 (D-C), 4.68 (T1) and 3.112 (T1-T2). As anticipated in Section 2, the\nnumber of vertices at distance tin the bond tree is expected to be proportional to the number of\ncells at that distance, Vt=Ft/\u03bdt. Indeed, we \ufb01nd a coe\ufb03cient of proportionalitythat asymptotically\ntends to \u03bdt\u2192\u03bd\u221e= 0.5.\nAsymptotically, the mean vertex connectivity zttends to 2, which is typical of a tree structure\nspanning vertices distributed uniformly on a \ufb01nite area (see \ufb01g.3(c) and \ufb01g.12). There are nsuch\ntrees for an n-sided central cell. If the trees were not impeding each other one w ould expect Vt\u221dtn,\nasymptotically in t. But trees do impede each other. This interaction between the ntrees implies\nthat, after a certain distance, the leading contribution to Vtis proportional to t, regardless of n. The\nin\ufb02uence of the central cell is screened by the disorder [16], which d istributes the vertices uniformly\non the plane. This is manifest in Fig.13, which shows that Vtis linear in n, with a slope independent\noft.\n10\nFigure 10: Two topologically equivalent views of the \ufb01nal con\ufb01guratio n for the T1-T2 simulation.\nThere are three cells of 6 sides tiling a torus.

Similar behaviours were\nfound for the other two types of simulations.\nShell structures\nThe number of cells Kjat shell distance j(whether within layer ( j) or inside defect inclusions)\nincreases linearly with jafter the \ufb01rst few layers. The dependence of Kjon the number of edges n\nof the central cell is also linear. Among all cells at distance j, the proportion belonging to defects\nis 18% for the C-D simulation, 52% and 38% for the T1 and T1-T2 simulat ions, stationary after\na few layers. Fig.14 shows the averaged (over all central cells) num ber of cells \u221dangbracketleftKj\u221dangbracketrightat a shell\ndistance j. Figure 14 shows clearly that the rate of growth Cof\u221dangbracketleftKj\u221dangbracketrightis very di\ufb00erent in the three\ntypes of simulations. The number of cells at a given shell distance is lar ger in the more disordered\nsystems. Speci\ufb01cally, the rate is C= 19.35 for the C-D simulation ( \u00b52= 1.77),C= 56.6 for\nthe T1 simulation ( \u00b52= 11.9) andC= 25.7 for the T1-T2 simulation ( \u00b52= 6.33). These values\nare much larger than C= 6 for the hexagonal tiling ( \u00b52= 0), or than C= 2\u03c0expected if layers\nwere circular annuli. Indeed, in disordered froths the concentric la yers wiggle around the averaged\ncircular annulus. This behaviour has already been observed in soap a nd Voronoi froths [12]. It can\nbe interpreted as an additional, negative curvature caused by the disorder, and compensated by the\npositive curvature of the defects intercalated between the layer s to produce a tiling which is globally\nEuclidean. A relation for the slope Cin froths free of topological defects (SSI) ans with shortest\nranged correlations was obtained in [12]: C= 6+(3 \u2212a)\u00b52, withathe Aboav-Weaire parameter.\nThis relation give C= 10.2,C= 51.3 andC= 24.7 for the C-D, T1 and T1-T2 simulations,\nrespectivelly. The moderate agreement indicates that defects ar e relevant.\nThe topological charge ( Qj) of a cluster bounded by layer ( j) (included) has been measured in\nthe three types of simulation. Figure (15) shows the averaged cha rge\u221dangbracketleftQj\u221dangbracketrightas a function of the shell\ndistance j(the average is over all the central cells). The topological charge \u221dangbracketleftQj\u221dangbracketrightis negative and\ndecreases linearly with j(similar results were found for soap and Voronoi froths [12]). The m ean\ntopological charge per defect ( \u221dangbracketleftqdef\u221dangbracketright) is independent of jat largej. We found \u221dangbracketleftqdef\u221dangbracketright= 1.1 in the\nC-D simulation, \u221dangbracketleftqdef\u221dangbracketright= 2.1 and\u221dangbracketleftqdef\u221dangbracketright= 1.8 in the T1 and T1-T2 simulations, respectively.\nThe negative topological charge of the cluster ( Qj) is due to the wiggling of the boundary. The\nlinearity shows that the amplitude of the wiggling remains constant wit h increasing shell distance.\nThe boundary does not roughen as jincreases.

Several disordered froths with\nmore than 105cells were generated by computer simulations. The results present ed in this paper\nrefer to three types of simulations of cellular systems (C-D, T1 and T1-T2) generated with di\ufb00erent\ntechniques, which exhibit di\ufb00erent degrees of disorder. The T1 and T1-T2 simulations generate very\ndisordered systems where the number of edges of a cell \ufb02uctuate s widely.

The average is over all central cells. The topological charge of a n-sided cell is 6 \u2212n\nhomogeneous cellular pattern, somewhat akin to soap froths or ot her natural cellular structures.\nWhen C-D simulations are applied on an initially very disordered froth, t he system self-organises,\nand a more homogeneous con\ufb01guration with steady statistical pro perties is reached. In all three\ntypes of simulation, a stationary distribution of cells can be obtained . Moreover, the number of\ncells in the froth also remains stationary in the C-D simulation for a spe cial value of the probability\npd= 1/4 of dividing 6-sided cells.\nThese disorderedcellularstructureswerecharacterizedin terms oftwodistancesfrom anarbitrary\ncentral cell: the bondand theshelldistance. In terms of bond distances, the froth is structured in\na forest of nbond trees , rooted on the nvertices of the central cell. They have asymptotic vertex\ncoordination z\u221e= 2 and the number of vertices Vtat a given distance tincreases linearly both with\nnand with t.\nThe number of cells Kjat a shell distance jfrom a given central cell, increases linearly with j.\nThis linearity seems to indicate that froths remain Euclidean structu res, and that the concentric\nlayers of cells at the same cell distance jfrom the central cell, if they wiggle, do not roughen. There\nis no indication of fractal behaviour in our simulations (see [17] for an -arti\ufb01cial- example of fractal\nfroth). The rate of increase ( C) of the number Kjof cells with the shell distance jvaries strongly\nwith the type of simulation. It is larger for the more disordered syst ems,C= 6 for the hexagonal\ntiling, and C\u224319, 25 and 56 for the C-D, T1-T2, and T1 simulations, respectively. The slope of\nKjv.s.jis therefore a very good parameter to di\ufb00erentiate froths with va rious degrees of disorder.\nMoreover, these di\ufb00erences should be observable in the physical p roperties of the froth like the\ndi\ufb00usion coe\ufb03cient [18].\nThe topological charge Qjof a cluster of cells at shell distances i\u2264jfrom a given central\ncell is negative, with a linear dependence on j.

First consider the layer of cells at a shell distance jfrom\nthe central cell. Let P(t|j) be the conditional probability of \ufb01nding, among all the cells at shell\ndistance jfrom the central cell, a cell at a bond distance t. This probability can be written in terms\nofN(j,t) asP(t|j) =N(j,t)/[/summationtext\ntN(j,t)]. Letw(i) be the probability to require 2+ ibonds in the\npath between a layer and the next. Therefore, any cell in layer jis connected, in the bond tree, to\na nearest cell the layer j\u22121 through a (shortest) path of 2+ ibonds, with probability w(i). Thus,\nP(t|j) =t\u22122j+3/summationdisplay\ni=0w(i)P(t\u2212i\u22122|j\u22121) (for j >2). (3)\nLet us now calculate P(t|1) andP(t|2). Cells sharing an edge with the central cell ( j= 1) are at\na bond distance zero. Thus, P(t|1) =\u03b4t,0). Cells of the second layer ( j= 2) are connected to the\nnearest cell in the \ufb01rst layer through a path of 1 + ibonds with the same probability w(i) (i= 0\nlabels those cells connected by one bond directly to the central cell) . Thus,\nP(t|2) =t\u22121/summationdisplay\ni=0w(i)P(t\u2212i\u22121|1) =w(t\u22121). (4)\nThis \ufb01xes the initial condition in Eq.(3).\nThe weights w(i) can be in principle any discrete probability distribution. The simplest c ase is\nwhenw(i) =\u03b4i,0. In this case, Eq.(3) has the solution P(t|j) =\u03b4t,2j\u22123.

The method is based on the calculation of\nShannon mutual information between analyzed and artificial symbolical sequences,\nand allows the revealing of latent periodicity in any symbolical sequence. We show\nthe stability of the ID method in the case of a large number of random letter changes\nin an analyzed symbolic sequence. We demonstrate the possibilities of the method,\nanalyzing both poems, and DNA and protein sequences. In DNA and protein\nsequences we show the existence of many DNA and amino acid sequences with\ndifferent types and lengths of latent periodicity. The possible origin of latent\nperiodicity for different symbolical sequences is discussed.\n1. Introduction\nThe development of mathematical methods for the study of symbolical sequence periodicity is\ngiven special significance nowadays. Its main concern is the successful determination of DNA\nsequences from various genomes and the accumulation of a great number of amino acid sequences [1-\n7]. Therefore, there is a problem for mathematicians and biologists to solve - to determine the\nstructural features of these sequences and to find the biological meaning of the revealed structural\nfeatures of the sequences.\nOne such structural feature is a periodicity of symbolic sequences. Earlier comprehensive\nmathematical methods were developed for the study of periodicity of continuous and discrete\nnumerical sequences, using Fourier transformation and allowing the definition of the spectral density\nof a numerical sequence [8]. The same approach was widely used for revealing symbolical sequence\nperiodicity. However, such application of Fourier transformation demands presentation of a\nsymbolical sequence as a numerical sequence in which the properties of any symbolical text should be\ndisplayed unequivocally. The direct transformation of a symbolical text to a numerical sequence with\nreplacement of symbols by numbers is not an adequate transformation, because we actually introduce\nweights for symbols, leading to distortion of statistical properties of the initial symbolical sequence.\nEarlier, several approaches were used for solving this problem [9-17]. The most widely used is the\nmethod involving construction from the given symbolical sequence of m sequences consisting of the\nnumbers zero and one, formed according to the law: x(i,j)=1, if the symbol ai occupies a site j, and\nx(i,j)=0 in all other cases. Here A={a1, a2, \u2026, am} is the alphabet of a symbolical sequence and m is\n-1-\nthe size of the alphabet of a symbolical sequence. The Fourier transformation is then applied to each\nnumerical sequence and the Fourier-harmonics are calculated, corresponding to i-type symbols, as\nwell as matrix structural factors, corresponding to pair correlation of symbols [11]. Final spectral\ndensity is usually constructed taking into account statistical characteristics of random sequences [11].\nHowever, in our opinion the given method only works well for the study of periodicity of\nsymbolical sequences with a relatively short length (which is smaller than the size of the symbolical\nsequence alphabet). For periods with a length greater than the size of the symbolical sequence\nalphabet, there is the possibility of \"decomposition\u201d of the power of the longer periods in favor of the\nshorter ones. We shall explain this with the following example. Let a symbolical sequence be given\nwith the period YRTDFT repeated 50 times. For this sequence we have 5 numerical sequences\nconsisting of the numbers 0 and 1 (according to the alphabet used). In this case, for the letters Y, R, D,\nand F the Fourier-harmonics show the length of the symbolical sequence period equal to 6 symbols,\nbut for the letter T the period equal to 3 letters is found. This reduces the power of the 6-letter period\nby the value of the power of the 3-letter period. This effect will increase with the growth of the\nrelation of period length to the size of the alphabet used. Thus, it turns out that the power of the longer\nperiod is a kind of \"spread\" onto the power of the shorter periods, i.e. there is an effect of attenuation\nof harmonics with longer periods in favor of harmonics with shorter periods. This effect will be even\nstronger for cases where there are several replacements in periodic sequences - in such sequences\nperiods could not be simply identical.\nThe main purpose of the present work is to introduce the concept of information\ndecomposition (ID) of a symbolical sequence that allows the finding of all available cases of\nperiodicity in a sequence, as well as to develop an algorithm which will allow the calculation of ID for\na symbolical sequence based on any possible alphabet. In this study, the developed mathematical\napproach is applied for analysis of poetic texts, DNA sequences and several amino acid sequences.\nThe ID concept allowed us to discover latent periodicity in many poetic texts, genes and various\nproteins. We also discuss the possible origin of latent periodicity in symbolical sequences of various\norigin.\n2. Methods and Algorithms\nThe main objective is to define the spectral density of a symbolical sequence (or another\nsimilar function) without the use of any conversion of a symbolical sequence into a numerical\nsequence(s). Thus, spectral density of the longer periods should not be distributed onto the shorter\nperiods, as occurs in the case of symbolical sequence decomposition into a certain set of numerical\nsequences and following the use of Fourier transformation [9-17].\nFirstly, let us define the concept of latent periodicity of a symbolical sequence. Let S = s1\ns2\u2026sk be the sequence of symbols with the alphabet A={a1, a2,\u2026am}. If in the sequence s1 s2\u2026 sk  there\nis the subsequence sj+1 sj+2\u2026sj+np , so that at all i,r, 1\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3i\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3n, 1\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3r<p, sj+rp+i = sj+i where j\u00b3\u00b3\u00b3\u00b30, n\u00b3\u00b3\u00b3\u00b32, p\u00b3\u00b3\u00b3\u00b32, then\nthe sequence could be presented as S = s1 s2\u2026 sj [sj+1 sj+2\u2026sj+n]p sj+np+1 \u2026 sk. In this case we can name\nthe fragment sj+1sj+2\u2026sj+n as the period of length n repeated in the sequence p times. Expanding the\nconcept of periodicity, we name any fragment of the kind [sj+1 sj+2\u2026 sj+n]p sj+1 sj+2\u2026 sj+l, a periodical\nfragment, where l < n. It is obvious that such periodicity, reflecting some structural features of the\nsymbolical text, is at the same time the simple recurrence of the same fragment. Let us note that the\ngiven definition does not describe imperfect periodicity when the replacements of separate symbols in\nthe various periods are possible. Therefore, we shall expand the concept of periodicity further. Let\nsome positions of the period have more than one symbol (set of symbols). Let us introduce the name\n\u201ca dim period\u201d for any period where for each position the allowed set of symbols can be given. Let us\nname a fragment of a sequence containing, in each appropriate position, one of the allowable symbols\nof the period, as a fragment with a dim periodicity. Let us name as the latent period any dim period\nwhose occurrence in the random text is statistically improbable. A set of symbol frequencies for the\npositions of the period (in view of cyclic rearrangements of positions) we shall name as a type of a\nlatent period. For example, the sets of symbols used in various positions of the 6 letter period can look\nas follows: {YRT} {YR} {DF} {N} {RDF} {YTD}, where the symbols within brackets are symbols\nused in the corresponding position of the period, and N denotes any symbol. The corresponding set of\nsymbol frequencies or type of latent periodicity is shown in the T matrix:\n-2-\n1 2 3 4 5 6\nY 1/3 \u00bd 0 1/5 0 1/3\nR 1/3 \u00bd 0 1/5 1/3 0\nT 1/3 0 0 1/5 0 1/3\nD 0 0 \u00bd 1/5 1/3 1/3\nF 0 0 \u00bd 1/5 1/3 0\nThe elements of this matrix t(i,j) show the probability of the i type symbol in the period\nposition j. This latent period determined by the T matrix of probabilities may be observed in a certain\nset of symbolical sequences. One such sequence is: [YYDRFT] [RRFDDT] [TYDTFD] [YRDFRY]\u2026\nFrom this example, it is obvious that there is no appreciable similarity between the separate periods\n(placed in square brackets). Revealing such latent periodicity will be rather difficult using Fourier\ntransformation methods because of strong attenuation of harmonics with the longer periods in favor of\nshorter period harmonics, as was discussed above. Actually, for genetic texts, many latent periods\nremain unrevealed until now, and the periodicity of many biologically important sequences is not yet\nrevealed. For this purpose it is necessary to develop a mathematical approach allowing the revealing of\nlatent periodicity for periods with rather large lengths, and to define types of latent periodicity, i.e.\ntypes of an M matrix. We can expect that there would be various types of matrix M for latent periods\nwith the same length but from different symbolical sequences.\nThe concept of information decomposition (ID) of a symbolical sequence was applied earlier\nby authors for analysis of DNA and amino acid sequences [18-22]. Under ID, we understand a\nspectrum representing the statistical importance of mutual information for periods of various lengths\nin the analyzed symbolical sequence. Mutual information between the investigated symbolical\nsequence and artificial symbolical periodic sequences can be used for obtaining an ID spectrum. Let us\ntake a symbolical sequence a(i), i = 1,2, \u2026 L. We generate a set of artificial symbolical sequences\nwith periods from 2 up to L/2 of the same length as well as an initial symbolical sequence. We use\nnumbers as symbols of artificial symbolical sequences. The artificial symbolical sequence with period\nlength equal to 2 symbols can be presented as follows: 1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,\u2026; the sequence\nwith period length equal to 3 symbols can be presented as: 1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,\u2026; the\nsequence with period length equal to n symbols can be presented as: 1,2,\u2026,n, 1,2,\u2026,n, 1,2\u2026,n\u2026.\nFurther, we can determine the mutual information between the analyzed sequence a(i) and each of the\nartificial periodic sequences. Values of the mutual information define the ID spectrum for the analyzed\nsymbolical sequence. We fill a matrix M with dimensions (nxk) for the value of the mutual\ninformation, where n shows the period length of the artificial periodic sequence used, and k is the size\nof the alphabet of the analyzed symbolical sequence. The value of the mutual information is calculated\nas follows:\n\u0001\u0001=k\njimjimn\nI\n1),(ln),(\n1-\u0001n\nixix\n1)(ln)( -\u0001k\njyjy\n1)(ln)( LLln+     (1)\nwhere matrix M shows the numbers of coincidences of ij (i=1,2..,n; j=1,2\u2026k) type between compared\nsequences (L is the length of the analyzed symbolical sequence, x(i), i=1,2, \u2026, n are the frequencies of\nsymbols 1,2, \u2026, n in the artificial periodic symbolical sequence; y(j), j=1,2, \u2026, k are the frequencies\nof symbols in the analyzed symbolical sequence). The relation between elements of the T and M\nmatrixes is: t(i,j)x(i)=m(i,j).\nOne of the properties of mutual information is its orthogonality. This means that I(a, b)=0, in\nconditions where a and b are symbolical periodic sequences with period lengths representing prime\nnumbers. Another important property of an information spectrum is the nesting of mutual information\nfor various periods one into another [19]. This means that mutual information I(n) for composite\nperiod n = n1\u00b4n2\u00b4n3\u2026\u00b4nt  (n1, n2, n3,\u2026,nt \u2013 prime numbers) is equal to:\nI(n)=I(n1)+I(n2)+I(n3)+\u2026+I(nt)+I\u2019(n) (2)\nwhere I(n1), I(n2), I(n3),\u2026,I(nt) are the values of mutual information between artificial periodic\nsequences with lengths n1,n2,n3,\u2026,nt and the analyzed symbolical sequence; I'(n) - is \"pure\" mutual\n-3-\ninformation between the artificial periodic sequence with period length equal to n and the analyzed\nsymbolical sequence, which could not arise from periodicity with period lengths equal to n1, n2, n3, \u2026,\nnt. The formula (2) is easily deduced from the correlation of mutual information for three sequences\n[23], taking into account that the mutual information between artificial periodic sequences is equal to\nzero, if the period lengths of them represents various prime numbers.\nFormula (2) shows that short ID periods don\u2019t provide the effect of \u201cdamping\u201d of longer\nperiod statistical significance. On the contrary, ID allows accumulation of mutual information of\n\u201cprime periods\u201d (period lengths are given by various prime numbers) in \u201ccomposite periods\u201d. This ID\nproperty is attractive for the detection of long latent periodicity (where the period length value exceeds\nthe value of the alphabet size of the analyzed symbolical sequence).\nFIG.1. Dependence of the mutual information J(n, 4)=I(n, 4)-3(n-1) at the length of the period for 5-\nlipoxygenase coding region (34-1000 bases) (Matsumoto et al., 1988) of HUMLOX5A (GENBANK). Mutual\ninformation is shown for lengths of the periods multiple to three bases only. On a background of triplet\nperiodicity of DNA is distinctly visible the periodicity in 15 bases that shows herself as local maximums on\nlengths of the periods equal to 15, 30,45,60,75, \u2026 bases.\nFor ID construction it is necessary to take into account that the value 2I(n,k) is distributed as c2 with\nthe value of degree of freedom equal to (n-1)(k-1) [24]. The average value of a mutual information of\ntwo random symbolical sequences with alphabet size n and k, is equal to (n-1)(k-1) correspondingly.\nThis means that a I(n,k) dependence from n at the constant k has the linear component equal to (k-\n1)(n-1). Therefore, it is more convenient to show on the diagram the dependence J(n,k)=I(n,k)-(k-1)(n-\n1), which should resemble a diagram of the Fourier transformation. Such a relation is shown in Fig. 1,\nand in our previous publications [18,19]. This relation is similar to Fourier harmonics, but only for\nrelatively short periods. For longer periods, the mutual information determined by the formula [1]\nbegins to deviate from the c2 distribution if each element of the matrix M becomes less than 10 [25].\nThis deviation from the c2 distribution results in an increase of the average value of J(n,k) with an\nincreasing n value. Two approaches can be used for taking into account such a deviation of I(n,k) from\nthe c2 distribution in conditions of small sample statistics. The first approach allows direct calculation\nof the probability of the fact that the relation of symbols in the artificial periodic sequence and in the\nanalyzed symbolical sequence is caused by random factors only, instead of calculation of mutual\ninformation [26]. The second approach is based on a Monte-Carlo method for the estimation of the\nstatistical importance of J(n, k) by means of the value Z(n,k) calculation [20-22]:\nk)) D(J(n,  /}k) J(n,-k) {J(n, k) Z(n,= (3)\nwhere ) Jkn,(  and D(J(n,k)) show the average value and deviation of the J(n,k) value, for a set of\nrandom matrixes with the same sums x(i) and y(j) as in the initial matrix M(n,k). The results of the\nstudy of periodicity in various symbolical sequences are presented below. In our study, we used a\nMonte-Carlo method that permits the execution of the calculations relatively quickly [20-22].\n-4-\nInformation decomposition of a symbolical sequence we shall represent as a spectrum Z(n,k).\nThe spectrum Z(n,k) is similar to a spectrum of Fourier transformation for numerical sequences, but\nhas the following advantages: 1. The calculation of the spectrum does not require any transformation\nof a symbolical sequence to numerical sequences; 2. ID allows the revealing of both\nthe obvious periodicity and the latent periodicity of a symbolical sequence in which there is no\nstatistically important similarity between any two periods; 3. The statistical importance of long periods\nis not spread onto the statistical importance of shorter periods; 4. On the basis of the matrix M it is\npossible to determine the type of periodicity.\nThe proposed approach also allows us to refrain from using a fixed size window when\nsearching for periodicity in a symbolical sequence of large size. For this purpose, we search in the\nanalyzed window for the sub-sequence having the maximum Z value for every tested period length.\nThis approach allows us to realize a segmentation of the analyzed symbolical sequence, depending on\nthe presence of periodicity in various sites of the sequence. Using this approach, periodicity with\nvarious period lengths and of various types can be revealed [18-22].\nFor the study of the long symbolical sequence by the ID method we chose part of a sequence\n(window) with a length of 2000 symbols. With this window we realized the search for such sub-\nsequences, where each period length (in a range from 2 up to 200) had the most statistical importance.\nThe window was then moved forward 1000 symbols, and all calculations were repeated. If we analyze\nthe DNA sequence from Genbank or the amino acid sequence from the Swiss-Prot data bank or some\nlinguistic text, it is possible that the length of the analyzed text could be less than the offered window\nlength. In this case, the window size was made equal to the length of the sequence under\nconsideration.\nWe compared DNA sequences of the ID decomposition method with the Fourier\ntransformation and dynamic programming methods. For calculation of Fourier spectra we used the\nprogram \u201cGenescan\u201d [30, 69]. This program converts any DNA sequence to four binary sequences,\nwhich can then be Fourier analyzed in the normal manner, to examine correlations between the\nsymbols. For example, the DNA sequence agatctcggact converts to four sequences:\na   1010000000100\nt   0001010000001\ng   0100000110000\nc   0000101000010\nThe total Fourier spectrum of the DNA sequence is the sum of these individual spectra. We show the\npower of a periodicity against a period length for the Fourier spectra.\nFor the search for DNA sequence periodicity with the help of the dynamic programming\nmethod we used a program named \u201cTandem Repeat Finder\u201d [70]. This program used weights for\nmatches, mismatches and indels. These parameters are for Smith-Waterman style local alignment\nusing wraparound dynamic programming. Match weight was +2. Mismatch and indel weights\n(interpreted as negative numbers) were either 3, 5, or 7. Lower weights allow alignments with more\nmismatches and indels. The minimum alignment score to report a repeat was chosen as 50.0.\n3. Results\n3.1 Model sequence\nAt first we studied the presence of periodicity in 10 random texts (four-letter alphabet), with\nthe length of each being more than 100 million symbols. It was shown that there were no sub-\nsequences with Z value exceeding 7.0 in random texts with all lengths of the analyzed periods.\nRandom texts for analysis were generated by the random-number generator of the FORTRAN\nlanguage using the letter probabilities equal to the probabilities of the bases of the human genome\n(p(a)=0.26; p(t)=0.26; p(c)=0.24; p(g)=0.24). The results obtained demonstrated that we can consider\nperiodicity with Z exceeding 7.0 as statistically important for study of sequences with a usual length of\nup to 100 million symbols. We used this threshold value for the study of DNA sequences from\nGenbank. The same result was obtained for alphabets with up to 50 symbols.\nThe threshold value of Z can be less than 7.0, on the condition that the same level of statistical\nimportance is provided, if we analyze sequences with smaller length. The SWISS-Prot data bank\n(release 39) contains nearly 39 million amino acids, and the average length of amino acid sequence in\nthe data bank is 392 symbols. It allowed us to choose a threshold value of Z equal to 6.0 for the\n-5-\nanalysis of amino acid sequences from the SWISS-Prot data bank. The size of poetic texts analyzed\ndid not exceed 30,000 symbols, allowing us to choose a threshold value of Z equal to 5.0 for poetic\ntexts.\nWe also defined the ID of an artificial symbolical sequence (ATAAACT)100. In this sequence\nthere is a distinct period equal to 7 symbols. In Fig. 2 (a) it is shown that the statistical importance\n(expressed as Z value) is extremely large (exceeding 250) for period length equal to 7 symbols, and\ngradually decreases for period lengths divisible by 7. So, for such perfect periodicity, the mutual\ninformation reaches a maximum value when the period length is equal to 7 symbols. The mutual\ninformation maintains this level for period lengths divisible by 7, but the increasing number of degrees\nof freedom results in the gradual reduction of Z value for the c2 distribution.\nFig.2. Dependence Z (n,3) from length of the period n for:\na - symbolic sequence (ATAAACT)100;\nb - symbolic sequence (ATAAACT)100 after introducing of the 50% of random base changes;\nc - symbolic sequence (ATAAACT)100 after introducing of the 80% of random base changes.\nWe also calculated the ID after the introduction of 50% and 80% random changes in the\nperiodic sequence (ATAAACT)100 (Fig. 2 (b,c)). In these figures one can see that the introduction of\n50% random changes into the periodic sequence reduces the level of Z(7,3) to 50.0, and the\nintroduction of 80% random changes gives a level of Z(7,3) equal to 11.8. It is possible to determine\n-6-\nthe period equal to 7 symbols on the statistically important level (Z> 7.0) for the introduction of up to\n82% random replacements into the sequence (ATAAACT)100. The statistical importance becomes\ninsignificant for periods with length equal to 7 symbols in the case of a greater percentage of\nintroduced letter changes.\nFIG.3.

Matrixes \u0001 for latent periods of the poems that are shown in the Fig3. Letter upper the matrix\ncorresponds to the letter in the Fig.3.\nThese results show that information decomposition is very stable when a large number of\nrandom replacements are introduced. It allows the use of the ID method for the detection of latent\nperiodicity of the symbolical sequence in the absence of any statistically important similarity between\nany two periods. Such a property of ID is very attractive for the study of DNA sequences, as during\nevolution DNA sequences accumulated a significant number of base replacements.\n3.2 Poetic texts.\nIt seems quite natural to expect that poetic texts will have some degree of periodicity,\nsince such periodicity is quite evident at a perusal of poetic texts. The poetic texts have obvious sound\nperiodicity, which can have a reflection in the structure of the poetic texts. As ID is a sensitive method\nfor the detection of periodicity, it could reveal reflection of sound periodicity of the poetic texts\nwithout dependence on the used language. It means that poetic texts in different languages can have\nvarious types of periodicity determined by a matrix M, but a common appearance for them should be\n-8-\nthe presence of any latent periodicity. To notice such generality we analyzed some poetic products in\nthe Russian and English languages.\nAt first we analyzed several poems of the classic Russian poet, A.S. Pushkin. The ID of the\nA.S. Pushkin poem \"I remember a wonderful moment\u2026\" is shown in Fig. 3. In order to realize\ndecomposition, we considered a word space as a letter, and punctuation marks were equated to an\nadditional word space. The maximum value of Z was obtained for a period equal to 16 letters.\nSo, in matrix M a word space is considered as an additional letter and is marked as *. Matrix\nM demonstrates that the calculated latent periodicity is conditioned by non-uniform distribution of\nmany letters in period positions (Fig. 4). For example, the Russian letter E \"prefers\" to be located in\n1,3,4,5,7 and in 13 positions of the period, the Russian letter O is mainly located in 6 and in 13\npositions and the Russian letter B is mainly located in 7 positions, and so on. The statistical\nimportance of the 16-letter-long period is a result of small deflections from the expected frequency for\nmany letters. Expected values of frequency were calculated for a random text with the same alphabetic\nstructure.\nThe latent periodicity was also found in other poems of A.S. Pushkin and in poems of other\nauthors. In Fig. 3 (b,c,d) the latent periodicity of fragments in poems of V. Mayakovski and W.\nShakespeare is shown. The origin of the periodicity shown in Fig. 3 is also conditioned by preferable\ndistribution of many letters from the Russian or English language alphabets in certain positions of the\nperiod. For all four ID shown in Fig. 3 (a,b,c,d) one can see the existence of harmonics of the basic\nperiod with the period length divisible by the length of the basic period.\nLatent periodicity of poetic texts was revealed in the poems of various authors, writing both in\nRussian and in English. It is necessary to note that the latent period length in different texts by the\nsame author is not a constant value. Different fragments of text can be characterized by a latent\nperiodicity of various lengths. The type of matrix M (taking into consideration all cyclic\nrearrangements) for various texts can differ even for periods with identical length.\nOn the whole, the results obtained from the present study demonstrated that ID is capable of\nrevealing the structure of poetic texts, most probably caused by the sound periodicity of poems in\ndifferent languages [27,28].\n3.3 DNA sequences\nEarlier, many authors showed the existence of triplet periodicity in DNA sequences in the\nmajority of protein coding regions of genes [11,29-31]. Therefore, triplet periodicity has a coding\npotential, allowing the prediction of protein coding region positions in many genes [30]. But triplet\nperiodicity can prevent the detection of longer latent periodicity in genes. Since Z(n,k) at n lengths\nequal to 6,9,12,15, \u2026 contains I(3, k) as a component of the mutual information, so for the search of\nperiodicity with period lengths divisible by 3, we used random sequences for estimation of J(n.k) and\nD(n,k) with the same triplet periodicity as in the analyzed DNA sequence. For this purpose we\ndetermined frequencies for each of four bases in each of three possible position locations. Then, these\nfrequencies were used for the generation of a set of random sequences with triplet periodicity. Using\nthe random sequences with these properties allowed us to subtract I(3,k) from the mutual information\nI(n,k) for all of n = 6,9,12,15 \u2026.  It is interesting to note that by this method it is possible to take into\naccount the influence of periodicity of any length to longer multiple lengths.\nWith the algorithm developed, we studied the presence of latent periodicity in various gene\nsequences from different species from Genbank (release 122). We demonstrated that about 20% of all\nknown genes contain sequences with latent periodicity [18-22]. In Fig. 5 (Ai, Bi, Ci, Di) there are ID\nof several genes from various bacterial genomes. We chose bacterial genes for demonstration because\nbacterial genomes contain a low number of the mini- and micro-satellite DNA sequences. It allows us\nto propose that detected latent periodicity is not connected with recent insertion of different mini- and\nmicro-satellites into genes [32]. Corresponding Fourier spectra are shown in Fig. 5 (Af, Bf, Cf, Df). As\nit is possible to see from these figures, the Fourier transformation methods do not find the periodicity\nrevealed by the ID method. On the other hand, the program \u201cTandem Repeats Finder\u201d did not find any\nperiodicity in these DNA sequences.\n-9-\n10-\nFig.5. Comparison of the Information Decomposition and Fourier transformation spectrums for the DNA\nsequences from genomes of different bacteria for period lengths that are multiple to three bases. Z is the Score\nand P is the Fourier transformation power multiplied by 1000. Figures with letter i in the titles show the ID\nspectrums and figures with letter f show the Fourier transformation spectrums. All Fourier transformation\nspectrums have a strong triplet period and do not show latent periods found by ID methods. It may be caused by\nthe distribution of the power of long latent periods across more short periods by the Fourier method (see main\ntext).\nAi \u2013Bordetella pertussisi cya gene for calmodulin-sensitive adenylate cyclase.(981-6101 b.p.)

It is possible to see from Fig. 5 (Ai,\nAf) that the latent periodicity equal to 27 bases is observed on a background noise of the strongly\nexpressed triplet periodicity of this gene. The situation reminds us of so-called \"amplitude\nmodulation\" used in radio engineering for transmission of a signal by a carrier frequency. We found\nthe same situation in many genes from Genbank, and examples of this phenomenon are shown in Fig.\n5 (Bi, Ci, Di). Fig. 5 (Ci) shows the latent periodicity of the Deinococcus radiodurans gene for c-di-\nGMP phosphodiesterase with the length of period equal to 120 b.p. [46], and Fig. 5 (Di) shows the\nlatent periodicity equal to 120 b.p. of a fragment of Methylobacterium extorquens methanol oxidation\ngene mxaE [47]. We can assume that there are longer correlations in gene structures than triplet\ncorrelation and the long correlations can be important for the formation of defined protein structures.\nSuch long correlations can define preferences for using codons in defined gene positions. Triplet\nperiodicity can be considered as some rhythm intrinsic to coding sequences of genes on top of which\nlonger periodicity is expressed.\nFig. 5 (Bi) shows that the major part of the beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase gene [33, 34] has\nlatent periodicity with the period length equal to 120 bases. In Fig. 5 (Bi) one can see the harmonics of\nthe main period with lengths of 240 and 480 bases, as well as induced periodicity for short periods\nwith lengths of 40 and 60 bases. ID can be characterized by the property that the basic periodicity\n\"induces\" periodicity on shorter periods, which are constituent elements of the basic period. We\nconsider a period having the maximum Z value in the ID spectrum as the main period. Earlier, a\nmethod was developed for estimation of the influence of the main period on the statistical importance\nof other periods [19].\nWe also studied the presence of periodicity with period lengths non-divisible by three in DNA\nsequences from Genbank. We found more than 600,000 such sequences in Genbank. Fig. 6 (Ai, Bi, Ci,\nDi) shows the examples of revealed latent periodicity and Fig. 6 (Af, Bf, Cf, Df) shows the\ncorresponding Fourier transformation spectra. Latent periodicity found by the ID method can not be\nrevealed in the corresponding Fourier spectra, and any periodicity was not revealed by the program\n\u201cTandem Repeats Finder\u201d in these DNA sequences.\nThe presence of latent periodicity with period length non-divisible by three in gene sequences is very\ninteresting. It can prove that these DNA sequences might have existed long ago as mini-satellite\nsequences or sequences with multi-tandem duplications, but during evolutionary DNA transformations\nthese DNA sequences might have become a coding sequence. We noticed this phenomenon in the case\nof a region including two hypothetical proteins of Aeropyrum pernix (Fig. 6 (Bi)), a region of\nmercuric reductase MerA of Bacillus sp (Fig. 6 (Ci)) and two V-regions from Fugu rubripes of the T-\n-11-\n-12-\nFig.6.

Fourier transformation spectrums do not\nshow or show very low power for the latent periods found by ID methods. It may be caused by the distribution of\nthe power of long latent periods across more short periods by the Fourier method (see main text).\nAi \u2013 noncoding region of the NRC-1 plasmid of Halobacterium sp [48] from AE005163 (Genbank).\nDNA sequence from 7484 to 7670 bases has the latent period equal to 13 bases and Z(13,4) equal to 7.1.\nBi \u2013 region including two hypothetical proteins of Aeropyrum pernix from AP000063 [35].

DNA sequence from 13628 to 14594 bases has the latent period\nequal to 59 bases and Z(59,4) equal to 7,2.\nAf, Bf, Cf and Df - Fourier transformation spectra for the sequences analyzed by ID method in Fig.\nAi,Bi,Ci, and Di.\ncell receptor alpha-chain (TCRA) gene (Fig. 6 (Di)). The DNA sequences from these genes were\nfound with latent period length equal to 59 bases (Fig. 6 (Di)).\nIn Fig. 6 (Ai) the latent periodicity with length equal to 13 bases, found in non-coding DNA\nsequence, is also presented. Such period length is usually typical for mini-satellite sequences.\nTherefore, it is possible to assume that this DNA sequence represents a super-diverged mini-satellite\nsequence, accumulated after a great many mutations. The ID method, owing to its stability with\naccumulation of mutations, allowed us to see the periodicity of this sequence. We believe that the ID\nmethod can be very useful for the detection of ancient mini- and micro-satellite sequences in various\ngenomes. These sequences can be used for PCR analysis of various genetic traits.\n3.4 Amino acid sequences.\nThe latent periodicity of genes should be evident at amino acid level as well, but due to the\nambiguity of genetic code several classes of latent periodicity might become statistically insignificant.\nThis means that some types of latent periodicity in genetic sequences could be imperceptible at the\nlevel of amino acid sequences, and some types of amino acid latent periodicity could be unnoticeable\nat the level of DNA sequences. We studied the presence of amino acid sequences with latent\nperiodicity in the Swiss-Prot data bank (release 39). We revealed more than 12,000 amino acid\nsequences with various types of latent periodicity of various lengths. Figs. 7 and 8 show examples of\namino acid sequences with short and long latent periodicity. The periodicity in these examples was\nobserved for protein sequences of different kinds, including various enzymes. This may show that\nlatent periodicity is a characteristic of proteins, fulfilling certain structural functions as well as being\ncatalyzers for certain biochemical reactions. It can be assumed that relatively short latent periods (with\nperiod length from 2 up to 10 amino acids) (Fig. 7) are associated with secondary structure formation\nin amino acid sequences, such as: a-helix, b-layers and some combinations of these structures [32, 38-\n40]. Longer latent periodicity can be associated with the domain organization of proteins and packing\nof amino acid sequences [32, 38-40]. In this regard, the long latent periodicity of amino acid\nsequences can be responsible for hydrogen bond formation between elements of the protein secondary\nstructure, as well as for stabilization of protein structure by means of these interactions.\n4. Discussion and Conclusions\nThe developed method of information decomposition (ID) of symbolical sequences proved to\nbe capable of revealing the latent structure of various symbolical sequences. The method intended for\ndetection of periodicity appeared to be rather tolerant to a relatively large number of symbol\nreplacements. The results obtained using this method demonstrated that a large number of known\ngenetic texts contain sequences with latent periodicity of various lengths and various types. It is in\nagreement with the results of investigation of DNA sequences by integral mathematical methods and\nfinding the long-range correlations (LRC) in DNA sequences [55-68].\n-13-\nFig.7.

The reason is the rather large lengths of found periods, compared with the size\nof the alphabet used. The power of a long period, as noted above, is distributed on powers of a set of\nshort periods, leading to an impossible detection of latent periodicity. This appearance can be seen by\ncomparing the spectra ID decomposition and Fourier transformation shown in Figs. 5 and 6. It is very\ninteresting also that the method of tandem repeat finding based on dynamic programming [70] was not\ncapable of revealing any periodicity in the sequences shown in Fig. 5 and 6. It can be stipulated that\nthe use of a weight matrix of symbol coincidences limits the possibilities of determinating latent\nperiodicity. Therefore, it seems that the developed programs, based on a dynamic programming\nmethod,  are  only  useful  for  the  detection  of homologous  periodicity.  In this sense ID represents a\nuseful method for the definition of rather long latent periodicity in symbolical sequences, which could\nbe missed by other developed mathematical methods and algorithms.We think that the revealed latent\nperiodicity of gene sequences could be caused for two reasons. Firstly, gene sequences could be\nformed at the time of the first living organisms or some time later by way of simple multi-tandem\nduplications. After this, natural selection improved their properties over a long time. This\nimprovement could be connected to a set of directed mutations, realized in gene sequences. The\ndirected mutations could change triplet frequencies in genes in correspondence with defined\npreferences in amino acid usage, that could cause formation of the defined triplet periodicity of gene\nsequences. However, these mutations probably not could completely destroy the tracks of the\nprocesses of gene origin. Therefore, ID shows the presence of a rather long latent periodicity on a\nbackground noise of the presence of a triplet periodicity. Secondly, the latent periodicity of the genes\nwhich have been found in the present work can be stipulated by defined periodic spatial organization\nof coded proteins. For example, periodicity equal to 21 bases is usually connected with a-helix\nformation protein molecules [11, 38, 41, 42]. The longer periodicity could be determined by domain\norganization formation in proteins [32]; it could also be involved in the process of nucleosome binding\nwith DNA [43]. However, we observed a great variety of period lengths and types in DNA and amino\nacid sequences. It testifies that some other protein spatial structures have characteristic periods of their\nown [22]. It is possible to assume that the ID method is able to \"see\" certain structural characteristics\nof gene sequences, reflecting spatial organization of the corresponding proteins. In this regard, ID is\nobviously an important method, allowing the connection of the origin of certain protein structures with\nthe presence of certain latent periodicity in corresponding DNA and amino acid sequences.\nAs a result of our study, we have found more than 106 sequences with various types of latent triplet\nperiodicity, more than 2x106 DNA sequences with period length from 2 up to 200 bases (without\ntriplet periodicity) in Genbank (release 122) and more than 12,000 cases of latent periodicity of\nprotein sequences in the Swiss-Prot data bank (release 39).\nThe developed ID method, as well as the methods based on Fourier transformation, are not able to\ndetect latent periodicity with deletions or insertions of symbols. Deletions and insertions of different\nsizes are mutation events, frequently met in genetic texts. We think that this could lead to a reduction\nin the number of DNA and protein sequences with latent periodicity found by the ID method in the\nGenbank and Swiss-Prot data banks. It permits us to assume that the real number of sequences with\nlatent periodicity in genetic texts is actually considerably greater than can be revealed with the ID\nmethod at present. This is a reason why we are currently improving the ID method, using some of the\nmethods of profile analysis and dynamic programming. In the near future our results will be completed\nwith a large number of genetic texts with latent periodicity, revealed in the presence of deletions and\ninsertions of symbols.\nReferences\n[1] E.

An explicit relation, \nrelating the propagation speed to the connecting weights distribution and other network \nparameters, is deriv ed.

When the fed input is asynchronous, depending on t he \nweight parameters, the propagation speed is more than or less than the synchronous case. In this \ncase the propagation speed increases by increasing the mean or standard deviation of \nconnecting weights.

Introduction  \n \nRecent evidences from multiunit recording studies indicate that the cortical neural populations are \nable to produce precise firing sequences (Abeles 1993a,b ; Prut et al 1 998). In a precise firing \nsequence, when the first neuron fires, the second neuron fires 1t milliseconds later and the third \nneuron 2t milliseconds later, with a sub -millisecond precision across trials.  \nThe synfire  chain model, proposed by Abeles (1991) on the basis of anatomical and physiological \ncharacteristics of the cerebral cortex,  appeared to be able to explain the generation of precise \nfiring sequences. A synfire chain consists of successive pools of spiking neurons connected in a \nfeed-forward manner . If all neurons in one pool fire synchronously, they will in turn elicit a \nsynchronous firing pattern in the next pool and a train of synchronous firing patterns will be \ngenerated in the successive pools. In this case, when one observes three different neurons from \nthree successive pools, he will detect a precise firing sequence among them. Given that all \nneurons in a pool are synchronous, the same precise firing sequence can be detected in several \nobservations.  \nTo date, researchers have analyzed different aspects of the synfire chain models. These aspects \ninclude memory capacity (Herrmann et al 1995), learning algorithms (Hertz & Pr\u00fcgel -Bennett \n1996a,b; Sougn\u00e9 2001 ) and robustness of synchronous pattern propagation  in spite of noise \n(Postma et al 1999; Diesman et al 1999; Gewaltig et al 2001) etc.  \nAssuming that a synfire chain is responsible  for generating the observed precise firing \nsequences, the question arise that what properties of the synfire model are most im portant in this \nregard?  \nAs described earlier in the literature (Diesman et al 1999; Gewaltig et al 2001; Cateau & Fukai \n2001), an important aspect of synfire activity is the sustainability of synchronous firing patterns \nthrough the successive pools.  \nAs far as  its role in generation of precise firing sequences is concerned, another important aspect \nof synfire activity is the speed of pattern propagation from one pool to the next. Due to the synfire \nnotion, it is the velocity of pattern propagation through the successive neuron pools that \ndetermines the time interval between single spikes within a recorded firing sequence.  \nPattern propagation velocity has been addressed in some studies using numerical simulations \n(Arnoldi & Brauer 1996) and analytical method s (Arndt et al 1995; Wennekers & Plam 1996; \nWennekers 2000).  Arnoldi and Brauer (1996) have shown that two parallel synfire chains with \ndifferent propagation speeds, coupled with excitatory synapses, will become synchronized \neventually. Wennekers and Plam  (1996) and also Wennekers  (2000) have shown that the speed \nof pattern propagation in synfire chains considerably depends on the non -specific external input \n(background activity)  and also the number of co -activated chains. In these studies, the analytical  \napproach was restricted to over -simplified models , which do not allow the network properties \nsuch as connecting weights distribution and temporal spread of patterns in each pool to be taken \ninto account. On the other hand, the more detailed and biology in spired models were tackled only \nby means of computer simulations ( Arnoldi & Brauer 1996) , which can hardly capture the \nbehavior of the model holistically.  \nIn this article we have extended the analytical method used by Herrmann et al (1995), to account \nfor propagation speed in synfire chains. Thereby, we have derived an explicit formula, relating the \nspeed of pattern propagation between two successive layers, to the network parameters. In order \nto incorporate the effect of firing pattern temporal jitter into  the analysis, we have also used the \nnotion of pulse packets, which was introduced by Diesmann et al (1999).  \nGiven that the most learning algorithms proposed for the synfire chains (Hertz, Pr\u00fcgel -Bennett \n1996a,b; Sougn\u00e9 2001 ), are based on the modification  of connection weights, we focused our \nconcentration on the effect of connection weights distribution parameters on the propagation \nspeed. However , it is worth to note that our analytical method can be likewise used to study the \neffect of other network par ameters.  \nIn the next section the structure of our network model is introduced. In section 3, we have applied \nthe analytical methods to study the speed of pattern propagation in the network. In section 4, the \nanalytical results are verified with a computer simulation of the network. Finally in section 5, the \nbiological relevance of the results, particularly to the synfire model as a structure involved in the \ngeneration of precise firing sequences is discussed.  \n \n2. The network model  \nThe network studied in thi s article, is a multi -layered, feed -forward network, which consists of \nnon-leaky integrate -and-fire neurons. All the layers contain equal number of neurons (namely N) \n(Figure 1.a).  \n2.1 The neuron Model  \nThe non -leaky integrate -and-fire neuron model is a sim plified approximation to the more detailed \nconductance based neuron models (Koch 1999). The voltage of a non -leaky integrate -and-fire \nneuron changes continuously as a function of its input with a rate adjusted to the real neuron\u2019s \nmembrane time constant. W henever this continuous changing potential reaches a certain value \n(the threshold), an action potential is artificially inserted, which simulates the firing event. \nImmediately after the action potential, the voltage will be reset to the resting potential. Although \nthe non -leaky integrate -and-fire model is a caricature of a real neuron, it captures many of the \nreal neuron properties and is much more realistic than the classic binary (Ising) neuron models in \nwhich the states of the neuron are discrete.  \nThe r esting membrane potential of this neuron is assumed to be zero and in the sub -threshold \nregime, the membrane potential is governed by:  \n(1)                                                                             , )(    \n t Input\ndtdV\nii mm\nt =  \nWhere, m\niV is the voltage of the ith neuron at layer m, t is the membrane time constant of the \nneuron, which is taken equal for all the neurons in the network, and )(t Input imis the incoming \ninput to the ith neuron at layer m. \n \n \n \na                              b  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1.  a) A schematic view of the studied network. b) Schematic view of the probability density of firing times for \nneurons is successive layers. The mean -to-mean (or peak -to-peak) int erval (the bold lines) is an index for pattern \npropagation delay between successive layers.  \n \n \n2.2 The Input  \nThe neurons in the first layer, which are the initiators of synfire activity, are assumed to fire at \nindependent, normally distributed random times.  The temporal probability density function for \neach pulse generated in the first layer can be written as:  \n(2)                                                                       ))(5.0(\n21)(2\n1 11\ns sprtExp t \u2212 = ,                                                              \nwhere, 1sis the temporal standard deviatio n of the pulses. Without loss of generality, we \nassumed that the mean of firing times for the neurons in the first layer is zero. Thus, according to \nthe pulse packet notion (Diesmann et al 1999), the first layer produces a pulse packet containing \nN n=1pulses with a temporal standard deviation of 1s. \n\nExcept for the first layer, the input of each neuron is the weighted sum of the outputs of neurons \nin the previous layer, as illustrated in the following formula:  \n  (3)                                  , ) ( )(  1\n \u2211\u2212  =\u2212\njd\nji j ji it  t Outputw  t Inputm m m\n ,              \nin which m\njiw  is the weight of the connection between the jth neuron of the donor layer                  \n( layer m-1 ) to the i th neuron of the recipient layer (layer m), 1\u2212m\njOutput  is the spike generated \nby the jth neuron of donor layer (layer m-1), and d\nijt is the connection delay. The delays for all \nconnections are assumed to be equal, so we can omit the indi ces i,j and simply denote the delay \nby d\nt instead.  \n   \n2.3 The connections  \nTwo successive layers are fully interconnected but there is no connection within a layer itself. \nThere is also no feed back connection from one layer to the prev ious layers. All synaptic weights \nof the network are constant and distributed normally with mean weight of w and standard \ndeviation of ws. \n2.4 Output  \nA constant threshold value ( th) is assigned to each neuron, whi ch does not vary in time. The \nthresholds of all neurons are assumed to be equal. Whenever the membrane voltage of a neuron \nreaches its threshold, it fires, i.e. generates a spike which can be represented mathematically by \na delta (impulse) function as:  \n (4)                                                                 , ) ( )(m md j jtt t Output \u2212= , \nwhere, m\njt, is the firing time of the neuron, i.e. the time when its voltage has reached the \nthreshold. Immediately after firing, the voltage of the neuron is rendered zero. In real neurons the \nduration of an effe ctive action potential is considerably short, also immediately after producing an \naction potential the membrane potential declines, so the above assumptions on the firing state \n(namely setting voltage to zero and using d (impulse funct ion) as the ultimate output function) \nseem to be relevant. In this analysis, we assume that each neuron produces one spike at the \nmost in response of the incoming pulse packet.  \nAs mentioned above, the firing times of the neurons in the first layer have a d istribution with mean \n01=t  and standard deviation 1s. The neurons in the next layers in turn have firing times with \nsome probability distribution characterized by a mean (mt) and a standard devia tion (ms), i.e. \neach layer m produce a pulse packet containing mn pulses with a temporal standard deviation \nms, centered around mt. \nAs most of the neu rons in layer m fire in times near mt, the time interval between 1+mt and mt \ncan be used as a measure for pattern propagation delay between layers 1+m  and m. Thus, we \nuse the mean -to-mean (or peak -to-peak) interval as an index for pattern propagation delay \nbetween successive layers (Figure 1.b). Note that the pattern propagation delay has an inverse \nrelation with the propagation speed , i.e. the faster the propagation of pattern between to layers is, \nthe shorter the propagation delay will be. In the rest of this article, we will focus our study on the \neffect of the network parameters on the pattern propagation delay.  \n2. Analytic method  \nInserting eq.(3) and eq.(4) in eq.(1) and solving the differential equation for the ith neuron in layer \n1+m  yields:  \n(5)                                                                 ) (   1\n 1\n\u2211  \u2212\u2212 =+\njd\nj ji it tt w Vm mq\nt \n \n \nNow assume that the firing times of the neurons in layer m (the m\njt variables in (5) ) obey a \nnormal distribution:  \n(6)                                                           )) (5.0(\n21)(2\nmm\nmm\ns sprtt\nExp t\u2212\n\u2212 =  \n \n As it can be seen in section 4, this assumption is a reasonable approximation in a wide range of \nnetwork parameters.  \nWith this assumption, when the number of firing ne urons in the layer m is sufficiently large, \neq.(5) can be approximated as:  \n(7)                              ) (  \n)(1\nmm m m m\ns trtd\ni dt\n-\u00b5i\nittt Wn\n t) dtt (Wn\nt V\u2212\u2212\n\u03a6 =\u2032 \u2212\u2032 =\u222b\u221e+  \nwhere mnis the number of firing neurons in layer m,  iW=\u2211jij\nnw\nm is a measure for the average \nof incoming weights  to the neuron and )(x\u03a6  is the cumulative standard normal distribution. \nGiven that the weights of the network obey a normal distribution with mean w and stan dard \ndeviation ws, the iWwill obey a normal distribution with mean w and standard deviation \nms\nnw respectively. So, by eq.(7), it is obvious that )(1t Vi+m has also a normal distribution with the \nfollowing parameters:  \n                                                               (8)                                                                            \n) (\n  ) (   \n11\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\uf8f1\n\u2212\u2212\n\u03a6\n=\u2212\u2212\u03a6 =\n++\ntss\nss t\nmm\nmmm m m\nmd\nw\nVd\nttt\nnttt wnV\n \nas its mean and standard deviation.  \nClearly, when )(1t Vi+m becomes greater than or equal with the threshold, the neuron fires. So the \nprobability of firing before the time t for the neurons in layer 1+m  can be written as:  \n(9)                                                                                              )( ,  \n2)\n2(\n  \n11)(2\n1\n++\u221e\u2212+\n\u2212=\u2212\n=\u222b\nmsp\nmm\nVtu\nVthtudxxExp\n?\n \n \nEvidently, the probability distribution of firing for the neurons will be:  \n(10)                                                         \n2)2()( )()(2\n1\n1\nprm\nmuExp\ndttdu\ndtt d?t\u2212\n= =+\n+ \nNow, we must calculate the  mean of )(1t+mr  namely 1+mt.

In this case the pattern \npropagation speed is independent of the network parameters except the connection delay dt. \nWhen firing pattern of the layer m is not fully synchronized ( 0>ms ), the propagation speed can \nbe lower than or higher than the fully synchronous case, i.e. if the second term in the right side of \neq.(13) is positive, the mean -to-mean interval will be greater than dt, hence the pattern \npropagatio n speed will be lower and vice versa. The condition for the second term in the right \nside of (13) to be positive is:  \n (14)                                                                                       22\nts t\nmth nthww\u2212 <   \nFrom eq.(13) it is obvious that 0>\nwddD and 0>\nwddD\ns.(provided that all the parame ters are \npositive values). Thus, when the other parameters of the network are fixed, increasing the mean \nof connection weights will increase the propagation speed respectively, and increasing it more \nthan a critical value, can cause the propagation speed b ecome even more than the fully \nsynchronized case.  \nGiven that \nwddD\ns is also always positive, a similar reasoning is also applicable for the weights \nstandard deviation. In this regard, considering all the other parameters of the network to be fixed, \nthe condition for the second term in the right side of (13) to be positive is:  \n    (15)                                                                               22 2\n2tts\nmthwnth\nw\u2212 <  \nSo, increasing the weights standard deviation more than a critical value can increase the speed \nof pattern propagation as well.  \n \n4. Simulation results  \nWe evaluated the above discussion through a computer simulation of a two -layered feed -forward \nnetwork of non -leaky integrate -and-fire neurons. Each layer consists of 100 neurons. As \nmentioned above, the obtained results for two successive layers ca n be generalized for a network  \n \n \nFigure 2.

Note that the neurons in the f irst layer are set to fire with a mean \nfiring time of 0 and standard deviation of 5 ms . The solid curve is the result  of eq.(2) for these parameters b) The  \nprobability density distribution for firing times of the neurons in the second layer when 5=w  and 5=ws , c) \nwhen 93.7=w  and 5=ws , d) when 10=w  and 5=ws . The solid curves for the second layer (b -d) are the \nresults of eq. (10) and the dotted lines  are the approximated results for the mean firing times from eq(12).  \n \nhaving an arbitrary number of layers. To be a close approximation to the biological reality, the \nmembrane time constant is set to 20 msec and the threshold to 20 mV above the resting pot ential \n(McCormik et al 1985). The synaptic delay for each connection is set to be 5 ms . The membrane \npotential s of the neurons (eq.(1)) were solved numerically by the forward Euler method. The time \nstep was set to 0.01 ms .  \n \n \nFigure 3.  The effect of weig ht parameters on propagation delay. a) Propagation delay as a function of mean weight. b) \nPropagation delay as a function of weight standard deviation. The circles show the simulation results, the solid line is the \npropagation delay numerically calculated by eq.(10) and the dotted line is the result of eq.(13).  \n \nDuring the simulation, we imposed a normal distribution of firing times to the first layer (fig 2.a), \nand then studied the distribution of firing times in the second layer. The mean -to-mean interva l of \nthe two distributions is a measure for pattern propagation delay between the two layers. All the \nresults are the average of 100 realizations of the network with the corresponding parameters   \nFigure 2 illustrates the density distribution of firing tim es of the neurons in the first and second \nlayer for a number of weight parameters obtained the simulation (gray curves). The analytic \nresults are also drawn for comparison (solid curves). The firing times of the neurons in first layer \nwere set to obey a no rmal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 5 ms (figure 2.a). \nFigures (2.b -2d) show that our analytic formula for the density distribution of firing times in the \nsecond layer (eq (10)), which is the cornerstone of our analytic results, satisfacto rily feats the \nsimulation results. The approximated mean of the distribution for layer 2 (eq (12)) is also \nillustrated (dashed lines). Also our approximation for the mean of firing times is acceptable in a \nwide range of parameters.    \nAs it can be seen, th e output spike times in the second layer in turn have a somehow bell -shaped \n(though not symmetric) density distribution curve and can be approximated by normal \ndistributions, so our analysis can be generalized for more than two layers.  \n \nFigure 4. Propag ation delay as a function of input pattern temporal standard deviation.  a) When 5=w , b) when \n93.7=w , c) when 10=w . The circles show the simulation results, the solid line is the propagation delay \nnume rically calculated by eq.(10) and the dotted line is the result of eq.(13).  \n \nAlso note that the distribution of spike times in the second layer is narrower than that of the first \nlayers, i.e. the neurons in the second layers are more synchronized as menti oned by many \nresearchers (Abeles 1991; Herrmann et al 1995; Marsalek 1997; Burkitt & Clrak 1999).  \nFigure 3.a illustrates the propagation delay between the two layers as a function of mean \nconnection weight, when the other network parameters are fixed and t he neurons in the first layer \nfire with a temporal standard deviation of 5 ms . The simulation results are shown by circles, the \nexact analytic result derived numerically from eq.(10) is shown by the solid line and the \napproximated delay from eq.(13) by the  dashed line. As expected, by increasing the mean \nweight, the propagation delay decreases (i.e. the propagation speed increases), so that it can \nbecome even shorter than the connection delay.  Figure 3.b illustrates the propagation delay as a \nfunction conn ection weights standard deviation, when the other network parameters are fixed. \nHere also, the propagation delay decrease by increasing the weights standard deviation, as \nexpected.  \nFigure 4 shows the propagation delay as a function of input spikes temporal  standard deviation. \nIn figure 4.a, the mean weight is set to be 5=w . According to eq.(14) we expect the propagation \ndelay to increase by increasing the input spikes temporal standard deviation. As it can be seen, \nthe propagation delay i ncrease almost linearly by increasing the input spikes standard deviation.  \nIn figure 4.b, the mean weight is set to be 93.7=w , which according to eq.(14) must result the \npropagation delay to be insensitive to the input spikes standard devia tion. The simulation results \nconfirm this expectation. Finally, the mean weight is set to be 10=w  in figure 4.c. The simulation \nresults show that, as expected from eq.(14), the propagation delay remains unchanged by \nincreasing the input s pikes standard deviation in this case. So increasing the input spikes \nstandard deviation (i.e. the amount of asynchrony in input spikes) can increase, decrease or have \nno effect on the pattern propagation speed depending on other network parameters.  \n \n4. Di scussion  \nIn summery, we have studied the effect of weight distribution parameters and also the input \nspikes jitter (temporal standard deviation) on the speed of pattern propagation between \nsuccessive layers of a synfire chain, by analytical methods and als o computer simulation. \nIncreasing the mean or standard deviation of connection weights increases the pattern \npropagation speed. The input spikes asynchrony can increase or decrease this speed almost \nlinearly, depending on the weight parameters.  \nWhen the i nput spikes are fully synchronous, the propagation speed depends only on the \nconnection delays between the neurons, which are more structural properties of the network \ncompared with connection weights and do not change rapidly during the process of learnin g and \nplasticity. This result emphasizes once again the importance of synchronous firing patterns (as \nproposed in the initial notion of synfire chain) as the mechanism involved in generation of precise \nfiring sequences. When the input spikes to the network s are fully synchronous, the network can \ngenerate reproducible firing sequences, which do not change time by time with variations of the \nsynaptic weights. Furthermore, as it can be seen in figure 4, by increasing the temporal standard \ndeviation of input sp ikes, the random deviation of the propagation delay from its expected value \nincreases. So asynchrony in the input pattern may hinder the generation of reproducible firing \nsequences, even if the network parameters remain unchanged between two trails.    \nOn the other hand, the linear dependence of the propagation speed on the input spikes temporal \nstandard deviation, shows that a finite amount of asynchrony in the propagating patterns of a \nfeed-forward network, can act as a control parameter for the pattern p ropagation speed. The \nbiological relevance of this conjecture remains to be studied.    \n \nReferences  \nAbeles, M. (1991).  \nCorticonics: Neural circuits of the cerebral cortex.

INTRODUCTION\nThe polarization of biological cells has a wide scope of practical applica tions like manip-\nulation, trapping or separation of biological cells [1,2], and thus an acc urate characterization\nof the polarization is needed. While the polarization of biological cells ca n be investigated\nby the method of dielectric spectroscopy [3] as well as by the measu rement of \ufb01eld-induced\ncell movements [4,5], the former method has a much higher resolution [1]. For biological\ncells, the main contribution to the dielectric dispersion is the structu ral (Maxwell-Wagner)\npolarization e\ufb00ects [1]. Because of the practical applications, ther e is a strong need for\nintuitive models as well as simpli\ufb01ed equations which describe the param eter dependence of\nthe polarization. Thus, various cell models have been proposed for the analysis of the po-\nlarization mechanisms. However, due to the complexity of existing th eories, these methods\nhave not yet found broader acceptance.\nIn this work, we propose the use of the spectral representation [6] for analyzing the cell\nmodels. The spectral representation is a rigorous mathematical f ormalism of the e\ufb00ective\ndielectric constant of a two-phase composite material [6]. It o\ufb00ers the advantage of the\nseparation of material parameters (namely the dielectric constan t and conductivity) from\nthe cell structure information, thus simplifying the study. From th e spectral representation,\none can readily derive the dielectric dispersion spectrum, with the dis persion strength as\nwell as the characteristic frequency being explicitly expressed in te rms of the structure\nparameters and the materials parameters of the cell suspension ( see section II.B below).\nThe actual shape of the real and imaginary parts of the permittivit y over the relaxation\nregion can be uniquely determined by the Debye relaxation spectrum , parametrized by the\ncharacteristic frequencies and the dispersion strengths. So, we can study the impact of these\nparameters on the dispersion spectrum directly.\nThe plan of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we will review the\nspectral representation theory [6] and show that the dielectric d ispersion spectrum of a\ncell suspension can be expressed in terms of the spectral repres entation. In section III, we\n2\nwill apply the spectral representation to the various cell models an d present an alternative\napproach. We show that a better agreement with the experimenta l data can be achieved. In\nsection IV, we discuss the e\ufb00ects of dipole rotation. We will show tha t the dipole rotation\ne\ufb00ect has a strong impact on the dispersion spectrum when the cells are su\ufb03ciently long.\nDiscussion on further applications of our theory will be given.\nII.

Spectral representation\nThe spectral representation is initiated by solving the di\ufb00erential e quation\n\u2207\u00b7/bracketleftbigg/parenleftbigg\n1\u22121\n\u02dcs\u03b7(r)/parenrightbigg\n\u2207\u03c6(r)/bracketrightbigg\n= 0, (1)\nwhere \u02dcs= \u02dc\u01eb2/(\u02dc\u01eb2\u2212\u02dc\u01eb1) denotes the relevant material parameter and \u03b7(r) is the characteristic\nfunction of the cell structure. The electric potential \u03c6(r) can be solved formally [6]\n\u03c6(r) =\u2212E0z+1\n\u02dcs/integraldisplay\ndr\u2032\u03b7(r\u2032)\u2207\u2032G0(r\u2212r\u2032)\u00b7\u2207\u2032\u03c6(r\u2032), (2)\nwhereG0(r\u2212r\u2032) = 1/4\u03c0|r\u2212r\u2032|is the free space Green\u2019s function. By denoting an operator\n\u0393 =/integraldisplay\ndr\u2032\u03b7(r\u2032)\u2207\u2032G0(r\u2212r\u2032)\u00b7\u2207\u2032, (3)\nand the corresponding inner product\n/angb\u2207acketleft\u03c6|\u03c8/angb\u2207acket\u2207ight=/integraldisplay\ndr\u03b7(r)\u2207\u03c6\u2217\u00b7\u2207\u03c8, (4)\n3\nit is easy to show that \u0393 is a Hermitean operator. Let snand|n/angb\u2207acket\u2207ightbe the eigenvalue and\neigenfunction of \u0393 such that \u0393 |n/angb\u2207acket\u2207ight=sn|n/angb\u2207acket\u2207ight, where 0 \u2264sn<1 is a real eigenvalue. The\nintegral equation can be solved symbolically:\n|\u03c6/angb\u2207acket\u2207ight=\u2212\u02dcs\n\u02dcs\u2212\u0393|z/angb\u2207acket\u2207ightE0. (5)\nFrom the solution, we obtain the electric \ufb01eld and hence compute the e\ufb00ective dielectric\nconstant \u02dc\u01ebein the spectral representation. We further de\ufb01ne the reduced e \ufb00ective dielectric\nfunction [6]:\nF(\u02dcs) = 1\u2212\u02dc\u01ebe\n\u02dc\u01eb2=\u22121\n\u02dcsVE0/angb\u2207acketleftz|\u03c6/angb\u2207acket\u2207ight.

Dielectric dispersion spectrum\nFor cells of arbitrary shape, the eigenvalue problem of the \u0393 operat or can only be solved\nnumerically. However, analytic solutions can be obtained for isolated spherical and ellip-\nsoidal cells. For dilute suspensions of prolate spheroidal cells, the c ells can be regarded as\nnoninteracting. The problem is simpli\ufb01ed to the calculation of snand|n/angb\u2207acket\u2207ightwith a single cell,\nwhich can be solved exactly. Only two of the Fnare nonzero, due to the orthogonality of\n|n/angb\u2207acket\u2207ightwith|z/angb\u2207acket\u2207ight.\n4\nThus, in subsequent studies, we restrict ourselves to two poles ( n= 1,2). From Eq.(7),\nthe e\ufb00ective dielectric constant is written in the spectral represe ntation:\n\u02dc\u01ebe= \u02dc\u01eb2/parenleftBigg\n1\u22122/summationdisplay\nn=1Fn\n\u02dcs\u2212sn/parenrightBigg\n.

We obtain the dispersion magnitudes \u2206 \u01ebnand the\ncharacteristic frequencies fc\nn, respectively [7]:\n\u2206\u01eb1=F1\u01eb2s1(s\u2212t)2\ns(s\u2212s1)(t\u2212s1)2,\n\u2206\u01eb2=F2\u01eb2s2(s\u2212t)2\ns(s\u2212s2)(t\u2212s2)2,\nfc\n1=\u03c32s(t\u2212s1)\n2\u03c0\u01eb2t(s\u2212s1),\nfc\n2=\u03c32s(t\u2212s2)\n2\u03c0\u01eb2t(s\u2212s2),\nwheres=\u01eb2/(\u01eb2\u2212\u01eb1) andt=\u03c32/(\u03c32\u2212\u03c31).

(13)\nIII. APPLICATIONS TO VARIOUS CELL MODELS\nIn a recent work [7], we adopted the spheroidal model (SM) to analy ze the cell suspen-\nsions. Here we brie\ufb02y review the analytic results of the model:\ns1=Lz, s2=Lxy, F1=1\n3p, F2=2\n3p.\n5\nwhere\nLz=\u22121\nq2\u22121+q\n(q2\u22121)3/2ln(q+/radicalBig\nq2\u22121),\nLxy= (1\u2212Lz)/2\nare the depolarization factors along the z-axis andx-(ory-) axis of the prolate spheroid and\nqis the ratio of length Lto diameter D.\nIn the spheroidal model, we neglected the presence of a cell membr ane. To study this\ne\ufb00ect, weputforwardtheshell-spheroidal model (SSM) here. In thiscase, thebiologicalcells\nare modelled as shell-spheroidal ones with a spheroidal core of comp lex dielectric constant\n\u01eb1, covered with a confocal spheroidal shell of \u01ebs. For a small volume fraction pof shelled\nspheroidal cells embedded in a host medium of complex dielectric const ant\u01eb2, the e\ufb00ective\ndielectric constant \u02dc \u01ebeis given by the dilute-limit expression:\n\u02dc\u01ebe= \u02dc\u01eb2+p\u02dc\u01eb2(bz+2bxy).\nwherebzis the dipole factor for a single-shelled spheroidal cell along the z-axis [9]:\nbz=1\n3(\u02dc\u01ebs\u2212\u02dc\u01eb2)[\u02dc\u01ebs+Lz(\u02dc\u01eb1\u2212\u02dc\u01ebs)]+(\u02dc\u01eb1\u2212\u02dc\u01ebs)y[\u02dc\u01ebs+Lz(\u02dc\u01eb2\u2212\u02dc\u01ebs)]\n(\u02dc\u01ebs\u2212\u02dc\u01eb1)(\u02dc\u01eb2\u2212\u02dc\u01ebs)yLz(1\u2212Lz)+[\u02dc\u01ebs+Lz(\u02dc\u01eb1\u2212\u02dc\u01ebs)][\u02dc\u01eb2+Lz(\u02dc\u01ebs\u2212\u02dc\u01eb2)],\nwhereyis the volume ratio of core to the whole shelled spheroid, while bxyindicates the\ndipole factor along the x- (ory-) axis, which can be obtained by replacing the subscript z\nwithxyin the expression of bz. As a matter of fact, the cell suspension consisting of shell-\nspheroidal cells dispersed in a host medium is a three-phase system. Although the spectral\nrepresentation was generally valid for two-phase composites, we h ave recently shown that\nit applies to composites of coated spheres as well as to coated sphe rical particles randomly\nembedded in a host medium [10]. Note the sum rule/summationtextFn=pis no longer valid. Similarly,\none can show that the spectral representaton also applies to the present system consisting\nof spheroidal cells with shells of complex dielectric constant \u02dc \u01ebsdispersed in a host. The\ne\ufb00ective dielectric constant is then given by\n\u02dc\u01ebe= \u02dc\u01eb2/bracketleftBigg\n1\u2212/parenleftBigg2/summationdisplay\nn=1Fn\n\u02dcs\u2212sn+N.P./parenrightBigg/bracketrightBigg\n(14)\n6\nwithN.P.being the nonresonant part which vanishes in the limit of unshelled sph eroidal\ninclusions, where\ns1=Lz[1+(x\u22121)y+Lz(\u22121+x+y\u2212xy)]\nx\u2212Lz(x\u22121)2(y\u22121)+L2\nz(x\u22121)2(y\u22121),\ns2=Lxy[1+(x\u22121)y+Lxy(\u22121+x+y\u2212xy)]\nx\u2212Lxy(x\u22121)2(y\u22121)+L2xy(x\u22121)2(y\u22121),\nF1=px2y\n3[x\u2212Lz(x\u22121)2(y\u22121)+L2z(x\u22121)2(y\u22121)]2,\nF2=2px2y\n3[x\u2212Lxy(x\u22121)2(y\u22121)+L2\nxy(x\u22121)2(y\u22121)]2,\nwherex= \u02dc\u01ebs/\u02dc\u01eb2. We omit the complicated expression for the nonresonant part her e. In\nwhat follows, for the sake of convenience, we assume: (1) yis a constant for all coated\nspheroid; (2) xis a real number.\nIn Fig.1, we plot the structure parameters Fnandsnversusxfor various yand for (a)\nq= 3.46, (b) 7.17 and (c) 10 .24, respectively. In all case, p= 0.01. We \ufb01nd Fnis strongly\ndependent on yforx >0.5, whereas it is not the case for sn. It may be concluded that\nthe dielectric property of the cell membrane has a minor e\ufb00ect on th e dispersion magnitude\nratio, but plays no role in the characteristic frequency ratio.\nTo investigate the validity of these models, we compare to experimen tal data, which was\nextracted by using a temperature sensitive cell division cycle mutan t of \ufb01ssion yeast, cdc25-\n22 [8]. Asami\u2019s theory [8] results are also plotted for comparison. Fro m Fig.2, it is evident\nthat our model gives a better comparison with experimental data t han Asami\u2019s theory. The\nreason for the improvement lies in the introduction of the conductiv ity contrast tby using\nof the spectral representation. As stated in Ref. [7], the large di\ufb00 erence between our model\nand Asami\u2019s theory is due to a large \u03c31\u226b\u03c32used in contrast to Asami\u2019s claim \u03c31\u2248\u03c32[8].\nWe further \ufb01nd that SSM provides a better \ufb01t than SM for the dispe rsion magnitude ratio\n\u2206\u01eb1/\u2206\u01eb2, while SSM yields the same results as those of SM for the frequency r atiofc\n2/fc\n1\n(both curves overlap in the right panel of Fig.2), indicating that the dielectric property of a\ncell membrane is indeed unimportant.\n7\nIV. EFFECTS OF DIPOLE ROTATION\nAccording to the numerical results, we \ufb01nd that the SSM provides a better \ufb01tting with\nprevious experimental data than SM, but this improvement is actua lly too small. In other\nwords, the dielectric properties of a cell membrane does not play an important role in\ndielectric dispersion spectrum. But, those numerical result will also show that both SM and\nSSM cannot obtain a good agreement with experimental data. In th e presence of an electric\n\ufb01eld, cells of large length may rotate in favor of the applied \ufb01eld, thus we propose another\nmodel, namely the dipole-rotation spheroidal model (DRSM) to obta in a better \ufb01tting.\nWhen the cells are long enough, the rotation of dipole becomes very im portant with the\nexternal electric \ufb01eld under consideration, and the system is in gen eral anisotropic. We have\nto take into account the e\ufb00ect of dipole rotation on F1andF2, even for a weak electric\n\ufb01eld. Let us compute them from a thermodynamic consideration. We will show that they\nin general depends on q.\nConsider a spheroidal cell in an electric \ufb01eld E0. Its long axis makes an angle \u03b8with the\n\ufb01eld. The dipole energy of the cell is\nEd(q,\u03b8) =\u2212Re/bracketleftBigg\u02dc\u01eb2D3E2\n0\n16q(bzcos2\u03b8+bxysin2\u03b8)/bracketrightBigg\n, (15)\nwherebzandbxyare dipole factors along and perpendicular to the long axis:\nbz=1\n3(Lz\u2212\u02dcs), bxy=1\n3(Lxy\u2212\u02dcs).\nEq.(15) can be understood by the energy approach. For simplicity, suppose the major axes\nof the cells all lie along the electric \ufb01eld, i.e., \u03b8= 0, then the induced dipole moments of the\ncells give a contribution to the e\ufb00ective dielectric constant. In the d ilute limit,\n\u02dc\u01ebe= \u02dc\u01eb2+3p\u02dc\u01eb2bz,\nwherep=V1/Vis the volume fraction of the cells. For a \ufb01xed external \ufb01eld condition , the\ntotal electrostatic energy density of the suspension is given by Et=\u2212Re(\u02dc\u01ebeE2\n0/8\u03c0), which\nis equal to \u2212Re(\u02dc\u01eb2E2\n0/8\u03c0)+Ed/V, and hence the desired results.\n8\nWe showed that the conductivity contrast tattains a small negative value [7] and thus\nthe complex material parameter \u02dc scan be approximated by t. Consequently, both bzandbxy\nhave positive values. The probability is given by the Boltzmann factor\n\u03c1(q,\u03b8) =Ae\u2212Ed(q,\u03b8)/kBT(16)\nwhereAis a normalization factor such that/integraltext\u03c1(q,\u03b8)d\u2126 = 1, where \u2126 is the solid angle,\nd\u2126 = sin\u03b8d\u03b8d\u03d5. We can calculate F1andF2by the following integrals\nF1(q) =p/integraldisplay\n\u03c1(q,\u03b8)cos2\u03b8d\u2126, F2(q) =p/integraldisplay\n\u03c1(q,\u03b8)sin2\u03b8d\u2126. (17)\nTheF1(q)/F2(q) ratio may be obtained by integrating with respect to \u03b8from 0 to\u03c0/2 by\nsymmetry. In the absence of an electric \ufb01eld, Ed(q,\u03b8) = 0 and\u03c1(q,\u03b8) equals to a uniform\ndistribution. In which case, we obtain F1=p/3 andF2= 2p/3, and hence F1/F2= 0.5.\nWhentheelectric\ufb01eldisweakenough, theratioisstillconstantand F1/F2= 0.5. Otherwise,\nthe ratio will increase rapidly with q. Forq= 1,bz=bxyandF1/F2= 0.5 always. The\nabove result implies that both F1andF2depend strongly on qwhen there is an electric\n\ufb01eld. For large q,bz\u226bbxy, the spheroids tend to align with the applied \ufb01eld and hence\nF1/F2becomes very large.\nIt is found that the mean cell length depends on the cultivation time, whereas the\ndiameter is almost unchanged in an experiment [8], which will be applied to compare the\ndi\ufb00erentmodels. Inthefollowingnumerical calculation, withoutlosso fgenerality, weneglect\nthe small imaginary part of \u02dc \u01eb2, and de\ufb01ne a new parameter \u03be:\n\u03be=\u01eb2D3E2\n0\n16kBT(18)\nwhich characterizes the electric \ufb01eld strength.\nWe can readily obtain the dispersion magnitude ratio \u2206 \u01eb1/\u2206\u01eb2as well as the dispersion\nfrequency ratio fc\n2/fc\n1by substituting the results of F1(q)/F2(q) into Eqs.(12) and (13), and\nsettings1=Lzands2=Lxy. In Fig.3, F1/F2is plotted versus q. It is shown that F1/F2\ndepends strongly on the axial ratio q, especially for large qor strong magnitude of external\nelectric \ufb01eld.\n9\nTo compare with experimental data in Fig.2, we obtain good agreemen t in the DRSM\nwith\u03be= 0.017, which corresponds to a weak \ufb01eld E0\u22480.1 V/m. The results show that\ndipolerotationindeedplaysanimportantroleinthedielectricdispersio n\u2013wecannotneglect\nthe e\ufb00ect of the rotation of dipole induced by the applied electric \ufb01eld , especially when the\naverage length of cell is large. In addition, good agreement exists o nly for large cytoplasmic\nconductivity, as attributed to a higher ion concentration in their cy toplasm to avoid the\nshrinkage of cells due to a loss of water across the cell membrane.\nV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION\nHere we would like to make a few comments. At low frequencies, the ce ll membrane\ne\ufb00ectively insulates the interior of cell. In other words, a potential builds up entirely over\nthe cell membrane, leaving the interior of cell rather inactive to the \ufb01eld [1]. Thus \u01eb1\u226a\u01eb2\nands= 1+and it is reasonable to use s= 1.001 as \ufb01tting parameter. On the other hand,\nwe assume that the host medium has low loss and \u03c32\u22480 and at the same time a large\ncytoplasmic conductivity \u03c31\u226b\u03c32. Thust= 0\u2212and it is reasonable to use t=\u22120.0001 to\n\ufb01t the data.\nThe resulting equations [Eqs.(12) and (13)] are indeed simple equatio ns arising from\nthe spectral representation. These equations serve as a basis w hich describe the parameter\ndependence of the polarization and thereby enhances the applicab ility of various cell models\nfor the analysis of the polarization mechanisms. In this connection, the shell-spheroid model\nmay readily be extended to multi-shell cell model. However, we believe that the multi-shell\nnature of the cell may have a minor e\ufb00ect on the dispersion magnitud e ratio as well as on\nthe characteristic frequency ratio.\nIn the presence of external electric \ufb01elds, \ufb01eld-induced motions s uch as rotation of cells,\ndielectrophoretic motion or vibrational motion may have a signi\ufb01cant impact on the di-\nelectric dispersion spectrum. With the recent advent of experimen tal techniques such as\nautomated video analysis [11] as well as light scattering methods [2], t he cell movements can\n10\nbe accurately monitored. For purely rotational motions, the distr ibution of surface charge\non the cell surfaces may deviate signi\ufb01cantly from the equilibrium dist ribution for cells at\nrest, leading to a change in the polarization relaxation and in the dielec tric dispersion spec-\ntrum. In this regard, our recent work on dynamic electrorheologic al e\ufb00ects [12], in which\nthe suspended particles can have rotational motions, may be applie d to cell rotational mo-\ntions. InRef. [12], we found that the particles\u2019 rotational motions do change the polarization\nrelaxation substantially.\nIn this work, we considered a monodisperse cell suspension, in which the cells are of the\nsame shape (i.e., same length and diameter). While the diameter of the cells may remain\nconstant during the cultivation process, the cells may possess a wid e distribution of cell\nlengths[8]. Amodi\ufb01edtheory, whichtakesthedistributionoflengthin toaccount, isurgently\nneeded and our spectral representation theory will certainly help . In this connection, we\nmay apply a strong dc electric \ufb01eld (in addition to the ac probe \ufb01eld) to help separating\nthe long cells from the short ones. Our results indicate that even in a moderate \ufb01eld, the\nlong cells can easily be aligned with the applied \ufb01eld, while the short ones r emain essentially\nrandomly oriented. In this way, an emphasis of dispersion spectrum of the long cells can be\nmade possible.\nIn summary, prompted by the discrepancy between recent theor y and experiment on\n\ufb01ssion yeast cells, we have proposed the use of spectral represe ntation to analyze more\nrealistic cell models. We adopted a shell-spheroidal model to analyze the e\ufb00ects of the\ncell membrane. It is found that the presence of a membrane has on ly a minor e\ufb00ect on\nthe dispersion ratio, but plays no role in the frequency ratio. We fur ther included the\ne\ufb00ect of rotation of dipole induced by an external electric \ufb01eld. It h as been found that the\ndipole-rotation e\ufb00ect plays an important role in the dispersion magnit ude, but it does not\nchange the characteristic frequency ratio. We obtained good agr eement between theory and\nexperiment when dipole-rotation e\ufb00ect is included.\n11\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported by the Research Grants Council of the Ho ng Kong SAR Gov-\nernment.

Introduction\nThe nervous system creates many di\ufb00erent rhythms, each assoc iated with a\nrange of behaviors and cognitive states. The rhythms were \ufb01rst d iscovered from\nscalp recordings of humans, and the names by which they are known still come\nmainly from the electroencephalograph (EEG) literature, which pay s attention to\n\u2217Boston University, Department of Mathematics and Center fo r BioDynamics, Boston, MA\n02215, USA.

Therhythmicpatternsincludethealpha(9-11Hz), beta(1 2-30Hz), gamma\n(30-80 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), delta (2-4) Hz and slow wave (.5-2 Hz) rhythms. The\nboundaries of these ranges are rough. More will be said about the c ircumstances in\nwhich some of these rhythms are displayed.\nItisnowpossibletogetfarmoreinformationaboutthemechanismsb ehind the\ndynamics of the nervous system from other techniques, including e lectrophysiology.\nThe revolutions in experimental techniques, data acquisition and an alysis, and fast\ncomputation have opened up a broad and deep avenue for mathema tical analysis.\nThe general question addressed by those interested in rhythms is : how does the\nbrain make use of these rhythms in sensory processing, sensory- motor coordination\nand cognition? The mathematical strategy, to be discussed below, is to investigate\nthe \u201cdynamical structure\u201d of the di\ufb00erent rhythms to get clues t o function. Most\nof this talk is about dynamical structure, and the mathematical iss ues surrounding\nits investigation. I\u2019ll return at the end to issues of function.\n2.

The equations,\nwhich play the same role in neural dynamics that Navier-Stokes does in \ufb02uid dy-\nnamics, are an elaborate analogy to a distributed electrical circuit.

The term \u25bd2vrepresents the spatial di\ufb00usion, and Iextthe current fed\nintothe cell./summationtextIsynrepresentsthe currentsintroducedby couplingfrom othercells.\nThus, these equations can also be used to model networks of inter acting neurons,\nthe focus of this talk.\nEach of the intrinsic currents Iionis described by Ohm\u2019s law: Iionis electro-\nmotive force divided by resistance. In this context, one usually use s the concept\nof \u201cconductance\u201d, which is the reciprocal of resistance. The elec tromotive force\ndepends on the type of charged ion (e.g., Na, K, Ca, Cl) and the volta ge of the cell;\nit has the form [ v\u2212Vion], where Vionis the so-called \u201creversal potential\u201d of that\nion.\nThe dynamics of the conductances are what make the equations so mathemat-\nically interesting and rich. In a simple description of the conductance , each ionic\ncurrent has up to two \u201cgates\u201d, which open or close at rates that a re dependent on\nthe voltage of the cell. For each such gate, there is then a \ufb01rst ord er equation of\nthe form\nx\u2032= [x\u221e(v)\u2212x]/\u03c4x(v)\nRhythms of the Nervous System: Mathematical Themes and Variat ions 807\nwhere x denotes the fraction of channels of that type that are op en at any given\ntime,x\u221e(v) is the steady state value of xfor a \ufb01xed voltage, and \u03c4x(v) is the rate\nconstant of that gating variable. For example, the standard Na cu rrent has the\nformINa=gm3h[v\u2212VNa], wheregis the maximal conductance, and mandhare\ngatingvariablessatisfyingtheaboveequationfor x. Thedynamicsfor mandhdi\ufb00er\nbecausem\u221e(v) is an increasing function of v, whileh\u221e(v) is a decreasing function;\nalso\u03c4m(v) is much smaller than \u03c4h(v). The (chemical) synaptic currents have the\nsame form as the intrinsic ones, with the di\ufb00erence that the depend ence of the\ndriving force on voltage uses that of the post-synaptic cell, while th e conductance\ndepends on the pre-synaptic voltage. That is, Isynhas the form g/hatwidex[v\u2212Vsyn],\nwhere/hatwidexsatis\ufb01es the equation for x above, with vreplaced by /hatwidev, the voltage of\nthe cell sending the signal, and Vsynis the reversal potential of the synapse. The\ncoupling is said to be excitatory if the current is inward (increases vo ltage toward\nthe threshold for \ufb01ring an action potential) or inhibitory if the curre nt is outward\n(moves voltage away from threshold for \ufb01ring.)\nFor a simple version of the HH equations, there are three ionic curre nts; one\nof these (Na) creates an inward current leading to an action poten tial, one (K) an\noutward current helping to end the action potential, and a leak curr ent (mainly Cl)\nwith no gating variable. The HH equations are not one single set of equ ations, but a\ngeneral(and generalizable)formforafamilyofequations, corres pondingto di\ufb00erent\nsets of intrinsic currents (which can depend on position on the neur on), di\ufb00erent\nneuron geometries, and di\ufb00erent networks created by interactio ns of neurons, which\nmay themselves be highly inhomogeneous. Numerical computation ha s become\nhighly important for observing the behavior of these equations, bu t does not su\ufb03ce\nto understand the behavior, especially to get insight into what the s peci\ufb01c ionic\ncurrents contribute; this is where the analysis, including simpli\ufb01catio n, comes in.\nFor an introduction to HH equations, some analysis and some of its us es in models,\nsee [1].\n2.1. Some mathematical issues associated with rhythms\nIt is not possible to analyze the full class of equations in all generality . Our\nstrategy is to look for mathematical structures underlying some c lasses of behav-\nior observed experimentally; the emphasis is on the role of dynamical systems, as\nopposed to statistics, though probabilistic ideas enter the analysis .\nOurcentralscienti\ufb01cquestionhereishowrhythmsemergefromth e\u201cwetware\u201d,\nas modeled by the HH equations. As we will see, di\ufb00erent rhythms can be based on\ndi\ufb00erent sets of intrinsic currents, di\ufb00erent classes of neurons, and di\ufb00erent ways of\nhooking up those cells. There are some behaviors we can see by lookin g at small\nnetworks, and others that do not appear until the networks are large and somewhat\nheterogeneous. Even in the small networks, there are a multiplicity of di\ufb00erent\nbuilding blocks for the rhythms, with excitation and inhibition playing di\ufb00 erent\nroles. Noise appears, and plays di\ufb00erent roles from heterogeneity .\nInvestigators often use simpli\ufb01cations of the HH equations. For ex ample, this\ntalk deals only with \u201cspace clamped\u201d cells in which the spatial distributio n of each\ncell is ignored, and the equations become ODEs. (There are circums tances under\n808 Nancy Kopell\nwhich this can be a bad approximation, as in [2]). Under some circumsta nces, the\n4-dimensional simplest space-clamped HH equations (one current e quation, three\ngating variables) can be reduced to a one-dimensional equation; th us, networks of\nneurons can be described by a fraction of the equations that one n eeds for the full\nHH network equations. Another kind of reduction replaces the full HH ODEs by\nmaps that follow the times of the spikes. In both cases, there are a t least heuristic\nexplanations for why these reductions are often very successfu l, and hints about\nhow and why the simpli\ufb01cations can be expected to break down.\n3. Mathematics and small networks of neurons\n3.1. Centrality of inhibition in rhythms\nSome kinds of cells coupled by inhibition like to form rhythms and synchr o-\nnize [3-5]. This is unintuitive, because inhibition to cells can temporarily k eep the\nlatter from \ufb01ring (see below for important exceptions), but mutua l inhibition can\nencourage cells to \ufb01re simultaneously.\nThere are various ways to see this, with methods that are valid in di\ufb00e rent\ncontexts. For weak coupling, it can be shown rigorously that the fu ll equations\nreduce to interactions between phases of the oscillators [6]; the pa rticular coupling\nassociated with inhibition can then be shown to be synchronizing (tho ugh over\nmany cycles) [7]. If the equations can be reduced to one-dimensiona l \u201cintegrate and\n\ufb01re\u201d models, one can use \u201cspike-response methods\u201d to see the sy nchronizing e\ufb00ect\nof inhibitory synapses on timing of spikes . Both of these are describ ed in [6] along\nwith more references.\nAnother method, which I believe is most intuitive, looks at the ongoing e\ufb00ect\nof forced inhibition on the voltage of the cells, and how some of the pr ocesses\nare \u201cslaved\u201d to others. This is seen most clearly in the context of an other one-\ndimensional reduction that has become known as the \u201ctheta\u201d mode l, because of\nthe symbols used for the phase of the oscillations [8]. The reduced eq uations have\nbeen shown to be a canonical reduction of equations that are near a saddle-node\nbifurcation on an invariant circle (limit cycle). Many versions of HH-like models\n(and some kinds of real neurons) have this property for paramet er values near onset\nof periodic spiking, and they are known as \u201cType 1\u201d neurons.\nThe \u201ctheta model\u201d has the form\n\u03b8\u2032= (1\u2212cos\u03b8)+I(1+cos\u03b8).\nHeretheequationforthephase \u03b8hasperiodicsolutionsiftheparameter Iispositive,\nand two \ufb01xed points (stable, saddle) if Iis negative. To understand the e\ufb00ects of\nforced inhibition, we replace Iby a time dependent inhibition given by I\u2212gs(t),\nwheres(t) = exp(\u2212t/\u03c4) fort >0,and zero otherwise. With the change of variables\nJ(t) = 1\u2212gexp(\u2212t/\u03c4), this is a 2-D autonomous system. Figures [9] and analysis\nshow that the system has two special orbits, known in the non-sta ndard analysis\nliterature as \u201crivers\u201d [10], and that almost all of the trajectories f eed quickly into\nRhythms of the Nervous System: Mathematical Themes and Variat ions 809\none of these, and are repelled from the other. The essential e\ufb00ec t is that initial\nconditions become irrelevant to the outcome of the trajectories. A similar e\ufb00ect\nworks for mutually coupled systems of inhibitory neurons.\nThe rhythm formed in this way is highly dependent on the time scale of d ecay\nof the inhibition for the frequency of the network [11, 12]. These mo dels, and\nthe \u201cfast-\ufb01ring\u201d inhibitory cells that they represent, can display a large range of\nfrequencies depending on the bias ( Iextin HH, the parameter Iin the theta model);\nhowever, in the presence of a small amount of heterogeneity in par ameters, the\nrhythm falls apart unless the frequency is in the gamma range (30-8 0 Hz) [4, 13].\nThis can be understood from spike response methods or in terms of rivers.\nThe above rhythm is known as ING or interneuron gamma [14, 15]. A va ria-\ntion on this uses networks with fast-\ufb01ring inhibitory cells (interneur ons or I cells)\nand excitatory cells (pyramidal cells or E-cells). This is called PING (py ramidal\ninterneurongamma) [14, 15]. Heuristically, it is easyto understand t he rhythm: the\ninhibitory cells are set so they do not \ufb01re without input from the E-ce lls. When the\nE-cells \ufb01re, they cause the I-cells to cross \ufb01ring threshold and inhib it the E-cells,\nwhich \ufb01re again when the inhibition wears o\ufb00. This simple mechanism beco mes\nmuch more subtle when there is heterogeneity and noise in large netw orks, which\nwill be discussed later.\n3.2. Excitation and timing maps\nThe fast-\ufb01ring cells described above are modeled using only the ionic c urrents\nneeded to create a spike. Most other neurons have channels to ex press many other\nionic currents as well, with channel kinetics that range over a large s pan of time\nconstants. These di\ufb00erent currents change the dynamical beha vior of the cells, and\nallow such cells to be \u201cType II\u201d, which means that the onset of rhyth mic spiking\nas bias is changed is accompanied by a Hopf bifurcation instead of a sa ddle node.\nThe type of onset has important consequences for the ability of pa ir of such cells\nto synchronize. E.g., models of the fast-\ufb01ring neuron, if connecte d by excitatory\nsynapses, do not synchronize, as can be shownfrom weak coupling or other methods\ndescribed above (e.g., [7]). However, if the cells are Type II, they do synchronize\nstably with excitation (and not with inhibition). This was shown by Gutk in and\nErmentrout using weak coupling methods [16]. A more speci\ufb01c case st udy was done\nby Acker et al. [17], motivated by neurons in the part of the cortex t hat constitutes\nthe input-output pathways to the hippocampus, a structure of t he brain important\nto learning and recall. These cells are excitatory and of Type II (J.Wh ite, in prep.);\nmodels of these cells, based on knowledge of the currents that the y express, do\nsynchronize with excitatory synapses, and do not with inhibitory sy napses.\nThe synchronizationproperties of the such cells can be understoo d from spike-\ntiming functions and maps [17]. Given the HH equations for the cell, one can\nintroduce at any time in the cycle excitation or inhibition whose time cou rse is\nsimilar to what the synapse would provide. From this, one can comput e how much\nthe next spike is advanced or delayed by this synapse. From such a g raph, one can\ncompute a spike-time map which takes the di\ufb00erence in spike times in a s ingle cycle\nto the di\ufb00erence in the next cycle.\n810 Nancy Kopell\nThe analysis of such a map is easy, but the process raises deeper ma thematical\nissues. One set of issues concerns what is happening at the biophys ical level that\ngives rise to the Type II bifurcation, which is associated with a partic ular shape of\nthe spike advance function [18]. Analysis shows that the Type II is as sociated with\nslow outward currents or certain slow inward currents that (para doxically) turn on\nwhen the cell is inhibited [16, 17]; this shows how biophysical structur e is connected\nwith mathematical structure.\nAsecondsetofquestionsconcernswhythe high-dimensionalcoup ledHHequa-\ntions can be well approximated by a 1-D map. (In some parameter ra nges, but not\nall, this is any excellent approximation). The mathematical issues her e concern\nhow large subsets of high-dimensional phase space collapse onto wh at is essentially\na one-dimensional space. Ideas similar to those in Section 3.1 are rele vant, but\nwith di\ufb00erent biophysics creating the collapse of the trajectories. In this case (and\nothers) there are many di\ufb00erent ionic currents, with many di\ufb00eren t time scales, so\nthat a given current can be dominant in some portion of the traject ory and then\ndecrease to zero while others take over; this leads to structure t hat is more com-\nplex than that of the traditional \u201cfast-slow\u201d equations, and which is not nearly as\nunderstood. Such reductions to 1-D maps have been used in other investigations of\nsynchrony [19-21] involving multiple cells and multiple kinds of currents .\n3.3. More complex building blocks: Fancier inhibitory cell s\nSo far, I\u2019vetalked about networkscontainingfast-\ufb01ringneurons (inhibitory) or\nexcitatory cells. But there are many di\ufb00erent kinds of cells in the ner vous system,\nwith intrinsicand synapticcurrentsthat makethem dynamicallyvery di\ufb00erentfrom\none another. Once there are more currents with more time scales, it is easier to\ncreate more rhythms with di\ufb00erent frequency. That is, the di\ufb00ere nces in frequencies\noften (but not always) come from some time scales in the interacting currents, and\ncannot be scaled away.\nThe stellate cell of Section 3.2 is an excellent example of currents cre ating\nfrequencies; in a wide range of parameters, these cells, even witho ut coupling, form\na theta rhythm. Indeed, they are believed to be one of the primary sources of that\nrhythm in the hippocampus, which is thought by many to use these rh ythms in\ntasks involving learning and recall. As described above, these cells ar e excitatory,\nand synchronize when coupled by excitation.\nMore puzzling are inhibitory cells in the hippocampus that are capable o f\nforming theta rhythms as isolated cells with ionic currents similar to th ose in the\nstellatecells. Thepuzzleisthatthesecellsdonotcohere(inmodels)u singinhibitory\ncoupling. (The decay time of inhibition caused by these cells is roughly f our times\nlonger than the inhibition caused by the fast-\ufb01ring cells, but neither fast nor this\nslower decaying inhibition creates synchrony in models.) So what is pro viding the\ncoherence seen in the theta rhythm? (The rhythm can be seen in sm all slices that\ndo not have inputs from other parts of the brain producing theta, so in such a\nparadigm, the rhythm must be produced locally.)\nOne suggestion (Rotstein, Kopell, Whittington, in preparation) is th at the\ninhibitory rhythms seen in slice preparations with excitation blocked p harmacolog-\nRhythms of the Nervous System: Mathematical Themes and Variat ions 811\nically depend on both kinds of inhibitory cells discussed, the special on es (called\nO-LM cells [22]) and the others. Simulations show that networks of th ese cells can\nhave the O-LM cells synchronize and I-cells synchronize at a di\ufb00eren t phase, to\ncreate an inhibitory network with considerably more complexity than interacting\nfast-\ufb01ring cells involved in ING. Again, this can be reduced to a low-dim ensional\nmap for a minimal network (two O-LM cells, one fast \ufb01ring I-cell). How ever, the\nreduction now requires properties of the currents involved in the O -LM model, in-\ncluding the kinetics of the gating variables.\n3.4. Interaction of rhythms\nAnothersetofmathematicalissuesisassociatedwithtransitionsa mongrhythms.\nIn general, rhythms slower than gamma (e.g., beta, theta and alpha ) make use of\nionic currents that are active between spikes. These currents ar evoltage-dependent,\nso that changes in voltage, in the sub- and super-threshold regime s, can turn on\nor o\ufb00 these currents. Thus, neuromodulators that change the v oltage range of a\nneuron (e.g., by changing a leak current) can change which other cu rrents are ac-\ntively expressed. In that way, they can cause a switch from one rh ythm to another.\nFor example, models of the alpha rhythm [20] suggest that this rhyt hm makes use\nthe inhibition-activated \u201ch-current\u201d; this current is e\ufb00ectively o\ufb00 line if the voltage\nis increased (even below threshold level). Thus, a switch from alpha t o a faster\nrhythm (gamma or beta) can be e\ufb00ected by simply making the E-cells o perate in a\nmoderately higher voltage regime.\nThese switches can be seen in simulations (Pinto, Jones, Kaper, Kop ell, in\nprep.), but are still understood only heuristically. The mathematica l issues are as-\nsociated with reduction of dimension methods. In the regime in which t he network\nis displaying alpha, there are many more variables that are actively ch anging, no-\ntably the gating variables of each of the currents that is important in this rhythm.\nWhen there is a switch to gamma and those currents go o\ufb00 line, the ph ase space\nbecomese\ufb00ectivelysmaller. The mathematicshereinvolvesunderst andinghowthat\nphase compression takes place.\nA related set of mathematical questions concerns rhythms that a re \u201cnested\u201d,\none within another. For example, the theta rhythm often present s as the envelope\nof a series of faster gamma cycles, and the beta rhythm, at least in some mani-\nfestations, occur with the I-cells \ufb01ring at a gamma rhythm and the E -cells \ufb01ring\nat the slower beta rhythm, missing some cycles of the inhibitory rhyt hm. The\ngamma/beta switch has been understood from a physiological point of view (see\n[19] and its references) and has been simulated. The gamma/theta nesting is less\nunderstood, though new data and simulations are providing the phy siological and\nheuristic basis for this [22; Rotstein, Kopell, Whittington, in prep.].\n4. Large networks\nThough there are many more examples of other building blocks, I\u2019m tu rning\n812 Nancy Kopell\nto issues that do not appear in small network analysis. I\u2019m going to go back to a\nvery simple building block, but now put many such together. The simple building\nblock is one E cell, one I-cell, which together can create a gamma rhyt hm.\n4.1. Sparse coupling\nWe now considera networkwith N E-cellsand M I-cells, with randomcou pling\nfrom the E-cells to the I-cells and vica versa. Suppose, for example , there is a\n\ufb01xed probability of connection in each direction between any pair of E and I cells.\nThen the number of inputs to any cell is distributed across the popu lation, leading\nto heterogeneity of excitation and inhibition. Is it still possible to get coherent\ngammarhythms? Thiscanbeansweredwithmathematicalanalysisus ingthe\u201ctheta\nneuron\u201d model described above [9]. To understand synchrony in E/ I networks, it\nis helpful to understand what each pulse of inhibition does to the pop ulation of\nexcitatory cells and vica versa. The part in which both probability and dynamical\nsystems play a large role is the e\ufb00ect of a pulse of inhibition on a populat ion. The\n\u201crivers\u201d referred to above in Section 3.1 create synchronization if the inputs to cells\nhave no variance, but with variation in the size of the inputs, there is a spread in\nthe times of the outputs. This can be accurately computed using fe atures of the\ndynamicsandprobabilitytheory. Similarly, butwith lessaccuracy,on ecancompute\nthe the e\ufb00ect of variation of inputs on the spike times of the receivin g population\ndue to a pulse of excitation. The results lead to unintutive conclusion s, e.g., that\nincreasing the strength of the inhibition (which strengthens the sy nchronizing e\ufb00ect\nof the rivers) does not reduce the desynchronizing e\ufb00ects of ran dom connectivity.\nFurthermore, tight synchrony can be obtained even with extreme ly sparse coupling\nprovided that variance in the size of the inputs is small.\n4.2. Loss of coherence\nThe above analyses can be put together to understand synchron y of \u201cPING\u201d.\nHowever, they leave only partially answered many questions about la rger networks.\nOne such question, which is central to understanding how the asse mblies of neurons\nare created and destroyed, is the circumstances under which the synchrony falls\napart, i.e., what modulations of cells and/or synapses will lead to loss o f coherence\nof the gamma rhythm. The above analysis shows that too large a var iation in size\nof inputs to di\ufb00erent cells of the same population can be fatal. Similar p henomena\noccur with too much variation in drive or intrinsic currents. There ar e less obvi-\nous constraints that are understood from working with smaller net works described\nabove. From those, it is possible to see that ING and PING operate in di\ufb00erent pa-\nrameter regimes: the \ufb01ring times of the population in ING are govern ed by the bias\nof the I-cells (as well as the decay time of the inhibition); in PING, the inhibitory\ncells are more passive until driven by the E-cells, and the timing comes from bias of\nthe E-cells (as well as decay of inhibition). This means that the mecha nism of co-\nherence can switch between ING and PING by changing relative excit ability of the\ntwo populations. Changing the strengths of the I-E and E-I synap ses can also get\nRhythms of the Nervous System: Mathematical Themes and Variat ions 813\nthe population (large or small) out of the regime in which the E-cells syn chronize\nthe I-cells, and vica versa.\nA more mysterious issue that cannot be addressed within minimal net works is\nhowthesize ofthe sub-populationsrespondingonagivencyclea\ufb00ec tsthe coherence\non the next cycle and the numbers of cells participating, especially wh en there is\nsome heterogeneity in the network. E.g., as the number of inhibitory neurons \ufb01ring\nin a cycle changes, it changes the total inhibition to the E-cells, which changes the\nnumber of E-cells that are ready to \ufb01re when inhibition wears o\ufb00, and before the\nnext bout of inhibition. If the amount of inhibition gets too small, or inh ibition\ngets too dispersed, the coherence can rapidly die. Without taking in to account\nthe trajectories of each of the large number of cells, it is likely that s ome possibly\nprobabilistic account of the numbers of cells spiking per cycle can give some insight\ninto the dynamical mechanisms surrounding failure of coherence.\nSuch a reduction has been successfully used in a di\ufb00erent setting, in volving the\nlong-distance coherence of two populations of heterogeneous ce lls. In this case, if\nthe populations are each minimal (one E/I pair) for each site, there is 1-D map that\ndescribes the synchronization, with the variable the timing between the E and I\nsites [19] . For large and heterogeneous networks, the synchron ization (within some\nparameter regimes) can be described by a 3-dimensional map, in whic h the \ufb01rst\nvariable is the time between the \ufb01rst spikes of a cycle in the two E-cell populations,\nand the others are the fraction of I-cells \ufb01ring on that cycle in each of the two I-cell\npopulations (McMillen and Kopell, in prep.).\nRelated work has been done from a di\ufb00erent perspective, starting with asyn-\nchronous networks and asking how the asynchrony can lose stabilit y [23-25]. Work\nusing multiple time scales to address the formation of \u201cclusters\u201d whe n synchrony\nfails is in [26].\n4.3. Noise, PING, and frequency control\nOne of the main di\ufb00erences between ING and PING is the di\ufb00erence in r obust-\nness. Small amounts of heterogeneity of any kind make ING cohere nce fall apart\ndramatically [4,13]. By contrast, PING is tolerant to large ranges of h eterogene-\nity. The \u201cping-pong\u201d mechanism of PING is also able to produce frequ encies that\ncover a much wider range than the ING mechanism, which is constrain ed by loss\nof coherence to lie in the gamma range of approximately 30-80 Hz [4,13 ]. Since\nmany versions of gamma seen in experiments are of the PING variety , this raises\nthe question of what constrains the PING rhythms to stay in the ga mma frequency\nrange.\nA possible answer to this comes from simulations. C. Borgers, D. McM illen\nand I found that heterogeneity, unless extreme, would not disrup t the PING coher-\nence. However, a very small amount of noise (with \ufb01xed amplitude an d poisson-\ndistributed times) could entirely destroy coherence of the PING, p rovided the latter\nhad a frequency below approximately 30 Hz; if the same noise is introd uced when\nthe networkis in the gammarange, the behavioris onlyslightly pertur bed. Further-\nmore, the ability to withstand the noise is related to adding some I-I c onnections,\nas in ING. A heuristic explanation is that, at low frequencies, the inhib ition to the\n814 Nancy Kopell\nI-cells (which has a time constant around 10ms) wears o\ufb00 before th e excitation from\nthe E-cells causes these cells to spike. Thus, those cells hang aroun d the threshold\nfor signi\ufb01cant amounts of time, and are therefore vulnerable to be ing pushed over\nthreshold by noise. The mathematics has yet to be understood rigo rously.\n5. Mathematics and clues to function\nThe mathematical questions are themselves interesting, but the f ull richness of\nthe scienti\ufb01c endeavor comes from the potential for understand ing how the rhythms\ngeneratedby the brain might be used in sensoryprocessing, motor coordinationand\ncognition. We are still at the outer edges of such an investigation, b ut there are\nmany clues from animal behavior, physiology and mathematics. Work done with\nEEGs(see, e.g., reviews[27,28])has shown that many cognitiveand mo tortasks are\nassociated with speci\ufb01c rhythms appearing in di\ufb00erent parts of the tasks. Gamma\nis often associated with attention, awareness and perception, be ta with preparation\nfor motor activies and high-order cognitive tasks, theta with learn ing and recall and\nalpha with quiet awareness (there are several di\ufb00erent versions o f alpha in di\ufb00erent\nparts of the brain and found in di\ufb00erent circumstances). Work don e in whole\nanimalsandin slicepreparationsaregivingclues to the underlyingphys iologyofthe\nrhythms, and how various neuromodulators change the rhythms, e.g., [14]. Much\nof the math done so far has concerned how the networks produce their rhythms\nfrom their ionic currents and connectivity, and has not directly add ressed function.\nHowever, the issues of function are starting to be addressed in te rms of how the\ndynamics of networks a\ufb00ects the computational properties of th e latter.\nOne of the potential functions for these rhythms is the creation o f \u201ccell as-\nsemblies\u201d, temporary sets of neurons that \ufb01re synchronously. T hese assemblies are\nbelieved to be important in distributed processing; they enhance th e e\ufb00ect of the\nsynchronized pulses downstream, and provide a substrate for ch anges in synapses\nthat help to encode experience. (\u201cCells that \ufb01re together wire tog ether.\u201d) Simula-\ntions show, and help to explain, why gamma rhythms have especially go od prop-\nerties for creating cells assemblies, and repressing cells with lower ex citatbility or\ninput [29]. Furthermore, the changesin synapsesknown to occur d uring gammacan\nfacilitate the creation of the beta rhythm (see [19] for reference s), which appears\nin higher-order processing. Mathematical analysis shows that the beta rhythm is\nmore e\ufb00ective for creating synchrony over distances where the c onduction time is\nlonger. Thus, we can understand the spontaneous gamma-beta s witch seen in vari-\nous circumstances (see [19] and [29]) as creating cell assemblies (du ring the gamma\nportion), using the synaptic changes to get cell assemblies encode d in the beta\nrhythm, and then using the beta rhythm to form highly distributed c ell assemblies.\nThe new \ufb02ood of data, plus the new insights from the mathematics, a re open-\ning up many avenues for mathematical research related to rhythm s and function.\nA large class of such questions concerns how networks that are dis playing given\nrhythms\ufb01lterinputswith spatio-temporalstructure, andhowth is a\ufb00ectsthechang-\ning cell assemblies. This question is closely related to the central and controversial\nquestions of what is the neural code and how does it operate. Thes e questions will\nRhythms of the Nervous System: Mathematical Themes and Variat ions 815\nlikely require new techniques to combine dynamical systems and prob ability, new\nways to reduce huge networks to ones amenable to analysis, and ne w ideas within\ndynamical systems itself, e.g., to understand switches as global bif urcations; these\nare large and exciting challenges to the mathematical community.\nReferences\n[1] C.

We study the presence of Eig en\u2019s error\nthreshold and mutational meltdown. The phase diagram of the system shows\nthat the extinction of the whole population due to mutationa l meltdown can\noccur well before an eventual error threshold transition.\nTypeset using REVT EX\n1\nkeywords: Speciation models; Darwinian Theory; Population Dynamics; Eigen Mod el;\nMutational Meltdown.\nThe evolutionary process is due to the balance between two opposit e forces: random\nmutation and natural selection. Mutations tend to increase the ge netic diversity, while\nselection discriminates the individuals more apt to survive. A simple mod el for evolution of\nself-reproducing molecules was proposed by Eigen [1]. The inheritable characters (genotype)\nare modeled by a binary string g= (g1,g2,...,g L),gi\u2208 {0,1}, of \ufb01xed length L(haploid\nindividuals). The genotypic space is thus a binary hypercube of Ldimensions. One can\nthink of the zeros as good genes (or basis) and the ones as bad gen es. We shall denote the\nset of individuals sharing the same genotype as a strain.\nThe selection is modeled by the concept of \ufb01tness, which can be de\ufb01n ed as the survival\nprobability or birth rate of a strain in the limit of zero mutations and va nishing population\n(in order to avoid overcrowding e\ufb00ects). The selection acts on the external characters of an\nindividual, i.e. its phenotype m, which can be considered a (generally degenerated) function\nof the genotype m(g). The simplest phenotype (used also in Eigen\u2019s model) is a decreasing\nfunction of the fraction of bad genes in the genotype: m(g) = (1/L)/summationtext\nigi. The mutations,\noccurring with probability \u00b5, reverse the value of a single bit (point mutations) and thus\ncouple di\ufb00erent strains.\nThe classi\ufb01cation of strains into species is based both on the phenot ypic traits and on\nthe genotypic information: for strains to belong to the same specie s, they must be connected\nby mutations and form an isolated cluster in the phenotypic space. T his last requirement is\nguaranteed, even in an almost \ufb02at \ufb01tness landscape, by competitio n [2], which \u201celiminates\u201d\nthe less adapted strains phenotypically near to a \ufb01ttest one.\nFor asharp peak landscape the genotype g= (0,0,...) has higher \ufb01tness \u03b1, and all\nother genotypes have the same lower \ufb01tness \u03b2: the \ufb01tness landscape is almost \ufb02at. Two\ndi\ufb00erent regimes are possible: in one phase the asymptotic limit is a bell shaped distribution\nin phenotypic space (quasispecies), centered around the master sequence; in the other the\nmost common phenotype is no more the \ufb01ttest one. The shape of th e distribution in this\nsecond phase is dominated by combinatorial factors, approaching a Gaussian in the limit of\nvery large mutation rates, with almost no di\ufb00erence among strains.\nThe transition between these two regimes, triggered by the mutat ion rate \u00b5or by the\nlength of the genome L, is called error threshold . While the original results have been\nobtained for an in\ufb01nite population, this transition, disregarding the e\ufb00ects of \ufb02uctuations,\ndepends slightly on the size of population [3,4]. The error transition ha s the character of a\ntrue phase transition (\ufb01rst order) for an in\ufb01nite genome length L[5].\nA related e\ufb00ect, e\ufb00ective in small populations, is called Muller\u2019s ratche t [6] orstochastic\nescape[7,8]: in absence of back mutations there is a \ufb01nite probability that the master\nsequence will be lost due to \ufb02uctuations. Since it relies on a random pr ocess, the average\nescape time is however of order of the exponential of the size of th e strain [9], and thus this\ne\ufb00ect is relevant only for very small populations. In practice, this is the ultimate extinction\nmechanism, e\ufb00ective when another cause has reduced enough the population. The error\nthreshold, on the other hand, does not depend on the size of the t otal population. In the\nfollowing we shall neglect to consider the in\ufb02uence of \ufb02uctuations.\n2\nWhen the total population size is not kept \ufb01xed, the presence of un favorable mutations\nreduces the average \ufb01tness, and this can lead to the extinction of the whole population, a\nphenomenon which is called mutational meltdown [10\u201312]. The presence of this e\ufb00ect in\nthe Eigen model has been shown numerically in Ref. [13].\nIn this work we propose a simple minimal model which is able to exhibit bot h the\nerror threshold and the mutational meltdown. Due to the form of t he \ufb01tness function,\nthe dynamics of the population is fundamentally determined by the \ufb01t test strains. Let us\nindicate with Xthe number of individuals sharing the master sequence, with Ythe number\nof individuals whose genotype has m= 1, and with Zall others individuals. We assume\nalso non-overlapping generations, so that we can consider a discre te time dynamics with\nunit equal to the generation time.\nDuring reproduction, individuals from strain Xcan mutate, contributing to Y, andY\ntoZ, with mutation rate \u00b5L. We disregard the possibility of back mutations from ZtoY\nand from YtoX. This last assumption is equivalent to the limit of a large genome, which\nis the case for existing organisms.

In this second case the\nasymptotic population size is\nNB=K/parenleftbigg\n1\u22121\nq\u03b1/parenrightbigg\n. (6)\nWe characterize the error threshold by the fact that the \ufb01ttest phenotype is no longer\nthe most common one, its phase boundary is given by x=y. Evaluating this condition at\nthe \ufb01xed point Bwe get from Eqs. (5)\nqe=\u03b1\n2\u03b1\u2212\u03b2. (7)\nThe mutational meltdown corresponds to the vanishing of the tota l population N= 0,\nwhile not changing its distribution. Thus, from Eq. (6) we have\nqm=1\n\u03b1. (8)\nOur de\ufb01nition of the error threshold transition needs some remark s: in the original\nwork [1] the error threshold is located at the maximum mean Hamming d istance, which\ncorresponds to the maximum spread of population. In the limit of ver y large genomes these\ntwo de\ufb01nitions agree, since the transition becomes very sharp [5]. F or \ufb01nite populations, a\npossible transition can be located in correspondence of the vanishin g of the probability of\n\ufb01nding the master sequence [3,13], in a way similar to Muller\u2019s ratchet.\nHowever, since the master sequence has always an higher e\ufb00ective \ufb01tness than other\nstrains, this implies that for \u03b2 <1 the error threshold is only a transient phenomenon before\nextinction, unless the population is arti\ufb01cially kept \ufb01nite, as in Ref. [3]. This mutation-\ninduced extinction has been investigated numerically by Malarz and Tig gemann in Ref. [13].\nThe condition for the disappearance of the master sequence is x\u2032/x <1 in the limit of\nvanishing x. Denoting arbitrarily this transition as Muller\u2019s ratchet\u2019s one, we obt ain from\nthe \ufb01rst of Eqs. (2)\nqr=\u03b2\n\u03b1. (9)\n4\nThis transition coincides with the mutational meltdown for \u03b2= 1.\nIn Figure 1 we plot the phase diagram of the three transitions for so me di\ufb00erent values\nof\u03b2. We note that the error threshold depends only on the ratio \u03b1/\u03b2(i.e. on the relative\n\ufb01tness of strains); on the other hand, the mutational meltdown t hreshold involves the whole\npopulation, so it depends on the absolute value of the \ufb01tness \u03b1. For\u03b2 <1 the mutational\nmeltdown transition crosses the error threshold, so one can obse rve both extinction of the\nquasispecies distribution or the error threshold in a stable populatio n, according with the\nparameters.\nThe physical relevant conditions for the extinction of the master s equence is \u03b2 <1, for\nwhich also the Ystrains vanish; otherwise back mutations cannot be neglected. Ou r toy\nmodel can approximate the M2 model by Malarz and Tiggemann, in whic h only one bit\nis mutated with probability Pmut, and thus q= 1\u2212Pmut. In that model the selective\nadvantage \u03b1/\u03b2of the master sequence is given by the number of o\ufb00springs, Nrep, while\u03b2\nis given by the reproduction probability Prep. Since they observed the extinction of the\nmaster sequence as error threshold, their data must be compare d with Eq. (9), thus\nPmut= 1\u22121\nNrep\ncorresponds to their error threshold transition and\nPmut= 1\u22121\nPrepNrep\nto the mutational meltdown. The phase diagram of this model is repo rted in Figure 2. The\nnumerical data of Ref [13] are well reproduced, except for a small shift of the error threshold\ntransition.\nIn summary we \ufb01nd that for a very steep \ufb01tness function ( \u03b1\u226b\u03b2), by increasing the\nmutation rate \u00b5or the genome length Lone always observes the error threshold; but for\nmoderately \ufb01tness di\ufb00erence among strains the mutational meltdo wn causes the extinction\nof the whole population while retaining the quasispecies distribution.\n5\nREFERENCES\n\u2217bagnoli@dma.uni\ufb01.it\n\u2217\u2217michele@poincare.dma.uni\ufb01.it\n[1] W.

INTRODUCTION\nIt is widely accepted now that the DNA molecule has a\nrather moveable internal structure, and that the internal D NA\nmobility plays an important role in functioningthe molecul e.\nThe thermal bath where the DNA molecule is usually im-\nmersed, collisions with the molecules of the solution which\nsurrounds DNA, local interactions with proteins, drugs or\nsome other ligands lead to activation of different types of i n-\nternal motions. Small oscillations of individual atoms nea r\nequilibrium positions, rotational, transverse and longit udinal\ndisplacements of atomic groups (phosphate groups, sugars\nandbases),motionsofthedoublechainfragmentshavingsev -\neral base pairs lengths, local unwinding of the double helix ,\ntransitions of DNA fragments from one conformationalform\nto another, for example, from A-form to B-form and so on,\nare only some of them. A more detailed list of internal mo-\ntionsandoftheirdynamicalcharacteristicscanbefoundin the\nworks of Fritzsche [1], Keepers and co-authors[2], McClure\n[3],McCommonandco-authors[4],Yakushevich[5,6]).\nDifferent approaches to the modeling of the internal DNA\nmobilityareknown.

The approach has, however, one essential de\ufb01ciency:\nbecause of the limited possibilities of modern computers it\ncan not be used to study long DNA fragments, and therefore\nitdoesnotsuitableforstudiesoftheprocessesofpropagat ion\noflocalstructuraldistortionsalongthemolecule.\nIn this paper, to investigate the internal DNA mobility, we\nuse the approach developed in a series of works [14, 15, 16,\n17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25]. Peculiarityoftheapproac h\nis that it uses rather simple models of the internal DNA dy-\nnamics, which take into account only one or a few types of\ntheDNAinternalmotions. Thissimpli\ufb01cationgivesanoppor -\ntunityto\ufb01ndanalyticalsolutionsofcorrespondingdynami cal\nequations imitating both small and large amplitude interna l\nmotions. Andonemoremeritoftheapproachisthatitgivesa\npossibility to study the internal dynamics of long DNA frag-\nments. Threeworksintheseriesareofmostinterest.\nThe \ufb01rst one has been done by Englander and co-authors\n[14] who studied the dynamics of DNA open states. Their\nmodel took into account only rotational motions of nitrous\nbases, which as it was suggested, made the main contribu-\ntion to formation of the open states. Another paper belonged\nto Peyrard and Bishop [22], who studied the processof DNA\ndenaturation. Suggesting that the stretching of the hydrog en\nbonds in pairs made the most contribution into the process,\nthey created a simpli\ufb01ed model where only transverse mo-\ntionsofbasesalongthedirectionofthehydrogenbondswher e\ntaken into account. The third important paper was published\nby Muto and co-authors [21]. These authors suggested that\ntwo types of internal motions were made the main contribu-\ntion to DNA denaturation process: transverse motions along\nthe hydrogen bond direction and longitudinal motions along\nthebackbonedirection. Theirmodelconsistedoftwopolynu -\ncleotide strands linked together through the hydrogen bond s\ndescribed by a Lennard-Jones potential, and the phosphodi-\nester bridges in the backbone were described by an anhar-\nmonicTodapotential.\nFurther development of the approach was limited for sev-\neral years by small improvements of the models and their\ncombinations, and only involvingnumerical methodsof sim-\nulationoftheinternalDNAdynamicsgaveanewimpulseand\n2\n\u03d5\n\u03d5n,1\nn,2n+1\nn\nn-1\nA Tr rT A\nha\nFIG. 1: Fragment of the DNA double chain consisting of 3 AT bas e\npairs.

Justthesemethodspermitted\nnot only to study a possibility of appearance of large ampli-\ntude localized distortions in the DNA structure, but also to\ninvestigate their stability, the in\ufb02uence of thermal noise , the\ninteractions between the distortions, the propagation of t hem\nalongthehomogeneousandinhomogeneousDNA.\nIn all these works, however, the asymmetry of the base\npairs was neglected. That is both bases in a pair weremodeled as identical structural elements with the same\ncharacteristics (masses, moments of inertia and so on).\nBut even in the case of homogeneous (synthetic) DNA the\nasymmetryexists. Indeed,if, forexample,oneof the polynu -\ncleotide chains consists of only adenines, the other chain\nshould consist of thymines, and this homogeneous model is\nsubstantially asymmetrical. Just this type of asymmetrica l\nmodel is studied in this work. To simplify calculations, we\nconsider only rotational motions of nitrous bases around\nthe sugar-phosphate chains in the plane perpendicular to\nthe main axis of the double chain. We \ufb01nd solitary wave\nsolutions describing open states in the double helix. We\nclassify the solitons, investigate stability of the solito ns with\nrespect to thermal oscillations, interactions between the\nsolitons, interaction of the solitons with inhomogeneitie s of\nthe chain. To solve all these problems, we use numerical-\nvariation methods ef\ufb01ciency of which was proved in the\nworks [31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36], devoted to the analysis of\nnonlineardynamicsofmolecularchainsandpolymercrystal s.\nII.

Stationarysolution\nTheresultsof numericalinvestigationsofthe problem(13)\nshow that in the homogeneous chains stationary topological\nsoliton solutions exist when the parameter of cooperativit yg\nis larger than the threshold value: g\u2265g0>0. The ab-\nsence of the soliton topological stability when g < g 0can\nbe explained in the following way. Any topological defect\ncan be eliminated by turning the DNA bases. The turning of\none base about 360 degrees transfers the system to the initia l\nstate, that is \u03c6i,n\u2261\u03c6i,n\u00b12\u03c0.

For soliton stability it is neces-\nsary that its width D >4.33. The view of stationary solitons\nwith the parameters of cooperativity g= 10andg= 150\nis presented in Fig. 4. In the case of the soliton with topo-\nlogical charge q=(1,0), the \ufb01rst component has the form of a\nsmooth step (when nmonotonously changes, the base of the\nTABLE III: Dependence of the threshold value of the paramete r of\ncooperativity g0on the value of the soliton topological charge q=\n(q1,q2)for homogeneous \u03b1\u03b2=AT(GC) chain\n(q1,q2) (1,0) (0,1) (1,1)\nAT 8.3 5.7 8.3\nGC 12.0 8.2 12.0\ufb01rstoftwoDNAchainsmakesacompleteturn)accompanied\nbysmoothsmallamplitudedeformationinthesecondcompo-\nnent (Fig. 4a).

In the\ncase of soliton with q=(1,1), each of the components has the\nform of a step (Fig. 4c), steps being displaced relatively on e\nanother. Later on we shall show that this soliton is the bound\nstateoftwotopologicalsolitonswiththecharges q1=(1,0)and\nq2=(0,1). There exist two equivalentstates of the soliton: th e\nleft state q=(1,1)l, when the soliton with the charge q1is on\nleft of the soliton with the charge q2(Fig. 4c), and the right\nstateq=(1,1)r, whenthesolitonwiththecharge q1isonright\nofthesolitonwiththecharge q2.\nWhen\u01eb= 6000 kJ/mol and K= 0.234N/m the pa-\nrameter of cooperativity g= 150.24\u226bg0, and when\nK= 0.8714N/m the parameter g= 40.34> g0(see Ta-\nble III) for all typesof topologicalsolitons. So, forthese val-\nues of the rigidity parameter Kstable solitons with different\ntopological charges exist. For maximum value of the rigid-\nity parameter K= 4.744N/m the parameterof cooperativity\ng= 7.41< g0,andthismeansthatstabletopologicalsolitons\nare absent. Thus the problem of the existence of topological\nsolitons (open states) in the DNA reduces to the problem of\nreceivingexactestimationoftheparameters \u01eb K. But thisis,\nhowever, a rather dif\ufb01cult problem. We think that the values\n\u01eb= 6000kJ/mol,K= 0.8714N/m, when all three types of\nsolitonsexist, are the most grounded.

Thereforeit isinterest ingto\nconsider the problem of interaction of solitons imitating t he\nopenstates.\nNumericalapproach(13)permitsustoinvestigatetheprob-\nlem and to obtain the dependence of the energy of a pair of\nsolitonswith thecharges q1,q2onthedistance betweentheir\ncentersn1,n2. For the purpose, it is necessary to take the\nboundary conditions and the initial point, which correspon d\ntoapairoftopologicalsolitonswiththecentersmovingawa y\nat a distance R. When minimizing the energy of the system\nE=\u2212L, it is necessary also to \ufb01x the turns of the bases,\nwhich correspondto the centers of solitons. Then the energy\nof the obtained state E(R)corresponds to the energy of a\npair of topological solitons, the solitons being at a distan ce\nR=n2\u2212n1from each other. By changing positions of the\nsolitoncenters,we canobtainthe potentialofinteraction\nUq1,q2(R) =E(R)\u2212E(q1)\u2212E(q2),\nwhereE(q1)andE(q2)isthe energyofisolatedsolitons.\nThe potential of interaction of solitons of different types\nand the potential of topological solitons with the charges o f\nthe same sign are presented in Fig. 6. The potential of two\nsolitons of different types with q1= (1,0)andq2= (0,1)\nhas the form of symmetrical double well potential (Fig. 6,\ncurve 1). Maximum of the potential is reached when R= 0,\nthatiswhenthecentersofthesolitonsareplacedattheneig h-\nboringchainsandwhenthesolitonsareoppositetoeachothe r.\nFromenergeticpointofviewthiscon\ufb01gurationofthesolito ns\nof differentchains is the most disadvantageous.

Thus two solitons of\nthistypecanformtwoenergeticallyequivalentcoupledsta tes.\nOneofthestates(leftminimumofthepotentialofinteracti on)\ncorresponds to the left isomer of the topological soliton wi th\nthe charge q= (1,1)l, and the otherstate (the right minimum\nofthepotentialofinteraction)correspondstotherightis omer\nofthesoliton q= (1,1)r.\nIf solitons have different signs of charges q1= (1,0)andq2= (0,\u22121), the potential ofinteractionhas a bell-like form\nwith one maximum at R= 0(Fig. 6, curve 2). From the\npotentialitfollowsthat,thesolitonswhichbelongtodiff erent\nchains,shouldrepulsefromeachother. Solitonswiththesa me\nsign of charge ( q1=q2= (1,0), (0,1)) also repulse from\neachother.\nWhen distance between the solitons decreases, the energy\nmonotonically increases and goes to in\ufb01nity when R\u21920\n(Fig. 6, curve3).\nThe potential of interaction Uq1,q2(R)permits to predict\nthe result of repulsion of solitons with the charges q1and\nq2. Let us model the repulsion of the solitons. For the pur-\npose, let us consider a double chain consisting of N= 4000\nbase pairs. At the ends of each of the polynucleotide chains\nlet us introduce viscous friction which provides with absor p-\ntion of phonons. The system of equations of motion (5),\nn= 1,2,...,N, was integrated numerically with the initial\nconditionwhich correspondsto two topologicalsolitons wi th\nthe centers placed in the points n1=N/4andn2= 3N/4\nandwith thevelocities s1=\u2212s2=s >0.\nThe results show that collision of solitons having equal\nsignsq1=q2= (\u00b11,0),(0,\u00b11)leads to their re\ufb02ection\nat one another. When the velocities sare small, the re\ufb02ection\nispracticallyelastic,andwhenthevelocities sarelarge,colli-\nsionisaccompaniedbyslightemissionofphonons. Collisio n\nof solitons with q1= (\u00b11,0),q2= (0,\u22131)ands= 0.5\nleads to their re\ufb02ection, accompanied by slight emission of\nphonons. Thisbehavioris in a goodagreementwith the form\nofcorrespondingpotentialof interaction(Fig. 6, curve2) . To\npass through one another, solitons need to overcome energy\nbarrierUq1,q2(0) = 2025 kJ/mol. Thus, their kinetic energy\nshould be equal to Ek(s) =Eq1(s) +Eq2(s)\u2212Eq1(0)\u2212\nEq2(0)> Uq1,q2(0). This condition is ful\ufb01lled only in the\nvicinity of the most possible values of the velocity (see. Fi g.\n5). So, when s= 0.5, the kinetic energy Ek= 1732kJ/mol\nis lower than the heightof the energybarrier(re\ufb02ectiontak es\nplace), and when s= 0.6, the energy Ek= 3000.9kJ/mol is\nhigherthanthe barrier(solitonspassthroughoneanother) .\nSolitons with the charges q1= (\u00b11,0),q2= (0,\u00b11)at-\ntract one another at a distance R >20a, and when the dis-\ntance is shorter they repulse one another. Here the energy\nbarrierUq1,q2(0) = 4989 kJ/mol does not permit solitons to\npass throughone another. Solitons always re\ufb02ect. Formatio n\nof the bound state does not occur even when the value of the\nvelocity is small. It is explained by small value of the bond\nenergy\u2206E= 91kJ/mol.\nPotential of interaction of different topological soliton s\nwith the charges of opposite signs (q1=\u2212q2)is presented\nin Fig. 7. Potential of interaction of one component soliton s\n(q1= (1,0),(0,1))monotonically decreases with the de-\ncreasing of the distance between the solitons.

Soliton can to\novercome the barrier only when its velocity s > s d, where\nthe threshold value of the velocity sdis taken from equation\nE(sd)\u2212E(0) =Ed. From the data of Fig. 5 it is easy to\n\ufb01nd, that for soliton with q=(1,0) the velocity sd= 0.21, for\nsolitonwith q=(0,1)thevelocity sd= 0.28,andwhen q=(1,1)\nthevelocity sd= 0.17.\nLetusmodelnumericallytheinteractionofsolitonwithlo-\ncal defectof the homogeneousAT chain.

The height of\nthe step is equal to the difference between the values of soli -\nton energy in homogeneous GC and AT chains. From data\nof table IV it follows, that the height of the step is equal\nto\u2206E= 1065kJ/mol for soliton with topological charge\nq=(1,0) and \u2206E= 844kJ/mol for soliton with q=(0,1), and\nwhenq=(1,1) the energy \u2206E=1894 kJ/mol. Soliton moving\nalong homogeneous AT region of the chain, can enter into\nGC region only if its kinetic energy Ek(s)>\u2206E. As seen\nfrom Fig. 5, this condition is satis\ufb01ed only if soliton veloc -\nitys > sk, where the threshold value of the velocity is de-\ntermined by the equation Ek(sk) = \u2206E. For soliton with\nq=(1,0) the velocity sk= 0.48, forq=(0,1)sk= 0.59, and\nforq=(1,1)thevelocity sk= 0.52.\nLet us model numerically the soliton moving from homo-\ngeneous AT region of the chain to homogeneous GC region.\nThe results of the modelingshow that the soliton with veloc-\n12\nFIG. 11: Movement of soliton with q= (1,0),s= 0.5through the\nboundary between homogeneous ATand GCregions.\nitys= 0.05< skand with any topological charge re\ufb02ects\nelastically from the boundary between the regions. At given\nvelocitythesolitonkineticenergyisnotlargeenoughtoov er-\ncome energeticbarrier( Ek(s)\u226a\u2206E). Soliton with s= 0.5\nq= (1,0)moves through the boundary between homoge-\nneous regions and its motion is accompanied by emission of\nphonons. Inside the region consisting of GC base pairs, soli -\nton continues to move, but with a smaller magnitude of the\nvelocity(Fig. 11). Forgivenvalueof qthe thresholdvalueof\nthe velocity sk= 0.48<0.5. So, the kinetic energy of soli-\nton is large enough to overcome energetic barrier. Because\nthe main part of the kinetic energy is spent to overcome the\nbarrier,thevelocityofthesolitonsubstantiallydecreas esafter\novercomingthe barrier. When q=(0,1) the threshold value of\nthevelocity sk= 0.59andsolitonre\ufb02ectsat s= 0.5fromthe\nboundary of the homogeneous regions. The re\ufb02ection is ac-\ncompanied by phonon emission. For soliton with the charge\nq=(1,1) the velocity s= 0.5< sk= 0.52is not enough to\novercome energetic barrier.

Eigen [1]\n1 Introduction and motivation\nEigen\u2019s quasispecies theory of molecular evolution is the simplest math e-\nmatical model that incorporates the central Darwinian paradigm o f natural\nselection acting on variability created by random mutations. The mod el was\noriginally developed to understand the conditions for the maintenan ce of in-\nformation in systems of self-instructive replicating macromolecules [2]. Such\nsystems can be realized in the laboratory in the form of populations o f RNA\nstrands which replicate in vitroin the presence of RNA replicase, display-\ning a wide range of evolutionary phenomena [3, 4, 5, 6]. The notion of a\nquasispecies [7] refers to the structure of self-replicating populations, which\ntypically consist of a distribution of related mutants centered arou nd a most\nabundant mastergenotype (see below). The quasispecies structure plays an\nimportant role in the evolution of RNA viruses, where the presence o f a wide\nrange of mutants allows the virus to adapt rapidly to environmental changes\n[8,9]. Ontheotherhand, theexistence ofanerrorthresholdbeyo ndwhichno\nlocalized quasispecies can be maintained (see Eq.(4)) places an upper bound\non the genome length of RNA viruses [10].\nThe mathematical structure of the quasispecies model has made it a fa-\nvored entrance way for statistical physicists into the \ufb01eld of biolog ical evo-\nlution1. It was \ufb01rst observed by Leuth\u00a8 ausser [14] that the discrete tim e dy-\nnamics (3) can be interpreted as a transfer matrix of a two-dimens ional Ising\nmodel, where the genotype sequences become one-dimensional sp in con\ufb01gu-\nrations that are coupled in the time direction through the mutation m atrix\n(1) [15]. A similar relation can be established between (3) and the tran s-\nfer matrix of a polymer directed along the time axis [16, 17]. In addition ,\nBaake and coworkers have recently exploited the equivalence betw een quan-\ntum spin chains and a class of kinetic evolution equations closely relate d to\nthe quasispecies model, in which mutation and selection occur in paralle l\n[12, 18].\nIn its most basic version, the quasispecies model is formulated in ter ms\n1Recent articles which review this connection are [11, 12, 13].\n2\nof standard chemical reaction equations2written for the concentrations n\u03c3(t)\nof sequences \u03c3= (\u03c31,...,\u03c3N), each of which is composed of Nsymbols drawn\nfrom an alphabet of Kletters; the usual choice is a binary alphabet ( K= 2),\nso that\u03c3itakes the values 0 and 1. The resulting sequence space consists\nthen ofS= 2Npoints arranged on the vertices of an N-dimensional hyper-\ncube. Each sequence \u03c3reproduces at a rate W(\u03c3), which may be taken as\na measure of its \ufb01tness [11]. In the reproduction process errors o ccur with\na mutation probability \u00b5per site. The probability of creating a sequence \u03c3\u2032\nwhen attempting to copy sequence \u03c3is therefore equal to\nQ\u00b5(\u03c3\u2192\u03c3\u2032) =\u00b5dH(\u03c3,\u03c3\u2032)(1\u2212\u00b5)N\u2212dH(\u03c3,\u03c3\u2032)(1)\nwhere\ndH(\u03c3,\u03c3\u2032) =N/summationdisplay\ni=1(\u03c3i\u2212\u03c3\u2032\ni)2(2)\nis the Hamming distance between the two sequences, i.e. the number of\ndigits in which the two di\ufb00er. The dynamical evolution in discrete time is\nthen given by\nn\u03c3(t+1) =/summationdisplay\n\u03c3\u2032W(\u03c3\u2032)Q\u00b5(\u03c3\u2032\u2192\u03c3)n\u03c3\u2032(t). (3)\nIntroducing the constraint of a \ufb01xed number of molecules leads to n onlinear\nloss terms on the right hand side of (3) [7]. However since these can g enerally\nbe transformed away, we ignore this complication here, at the expe nse of\ndealing with exponentially growing population numbers.\nThe linear form of the evolution equation (3) makes it plain that, for lo ng\ntimes, the concentrations will approach that eigenvector of the e volution ma-\ntrixW(\u03c3)Q\u00b5(\u03c3\u2192\u03c3\u2032) which corresponds to the largest eigenvalue. Provided\nthis eigenvector is localized in sequence space, it de\ufb01nes the quasispecies: A\ndistribution of related mutants centered around the master sequ ence, which\nusually is the sequence with the maximum replication rate W(\u03c3). The most\ncelebrated property of the model is its prediction of a sharp error threshold ,\nwhere the quasispecies delocalizes, and the population spreads unif ormly\nover sequence space. In terms of the sequence length Nand the mutation\nprobability \u00b5, the condition for a localized quasispecies takes the form [2, 7]\nN < N max=lnA\n\u00b5, (4)\n2Similar equations arise in classical population genetics [12].\n3\nwhereAdenotes the selective advantage , a measure for the superiority of\nthe master sequence compared to the other sequences. For the simplest case\nof a single peak \ufb01tness landscape, where the master sequence rep licates at\nrateW0and all other sequences replicate at rate W1< W0, the selective\nadvantage is A=W0/W1, while for randomly distributed replication rates\nit is a functional of the rate distribution [19, 20]. In terms of the phy sical\nanalogies described above, the error threshold phenomenon is equ ivalent to\nthe thermal phase transition in the Ising model [14, 15, 18, 20, 21] and to the\nthermal unbinding of a directed polymer bound to an attractive colu mnar\ndefect along the time direction [16, 17].\nMuch less appears to be known about the evolutionary dynamics of t he\nmodel, that is, the approach to the \ufb01nal quasispecies distribution f rom an\ninitiallocalizedordelocalized state. Itwas\ufb01rstpointedoutbyMcCas kill [19,\n22] that this dynamics should take the form of a \u201cslowing optimization walk\u201d\nthroughasuccession ofmetastable states which correspond, ins ome sense, to\nlocal maxima in the \ufb01tness landscape. The separation of time scales b etween\nthe (long) residence time ina metastable state and the (brief) tran sition time\nto the next maximum implies a punctuated pattern of evolution [23, 24, 25],\nwhich can be analyzed in analogy to variable range hopping in condense d\nmatter physics [26, 27, 28].\nWe should concede from the outset that the deterministic rate equ ations\n(3) are not an entirely appropriate description for this evolutionar y regime,\nsince the transition between two local maxima proceeds through th e tails\nof the localized, metastable quasispecies, where the population num bers are\nsmall and \ufb02uctuations due to the \ufb01nite number of molecules cannot b e ig-\nnored [22, 28, 29]. It seemed nevertheless worthwhile to explore th ese ques-\ntions within the most basic, deterministic model, before turning to mo re\nsophisticated approaches.\nThe present paper reports on some preliminary results from such a n in-\nvestigation. To avoid the complications due to a \ufb01nite error thresho ld, we\nconsider a strong selection limit (to be described in the next section) , in\nwhich the population is localized at a single site in sequence space at all\ntimes. This allows a direct comparison with simple schematic models of\nevolutionary dynamics, such as adaptive walks [30, 31, 32, 33] and r ecord\ndynamics [34, 35, 36]. Adaptive walks describe the evolution of a gene tically\nhomogeneous population under the assumption that deleterious mu tations\n(which decrease the \ufb01tness) are eliminated, while advantageous mu tations\nspread instantaneously. The population then performs an uphill wa lk in\n4\nthe \ufb01tness landscape, which terminates at a local maximum where no \ufb01t-\nter one-step neighbors are available. In contrast, in the quasispe cies model\nthe population evolves through a chain of local \ufb01tness maxima which p ro-\ngresses all the way to the globaloptimum. Some qualitative properties of\ntheseevolutionary trajectories are described in Section 3, while Section 4 fo-\ncuses on a speci\ufb01c statistical feature, the total evolution time. A comparison\nwith record dynamics is provided in Section 5, and some open question s are\nformulated in Section 6.\n020040060080010001200\n1 10 100 1000sequence number\ntimeexponential\nuniform\nFigure 1: Two evolutionary trajectories generated in two \ufb01tness la ndscapes\nwith identical ordering of \ufb01tnesses but di\ufb00erent \ufb01tness distributio ns. The\nmonotonic increase in sequence number for the exponential distrib ution is\nfortuitous - there is no correspondence between the position of a sequence on\nthey-axis and its \ufb01tness\nThroughout the paper we will consider maximally rugged \ufb01tness land-\nscapes, in which the reproduction rate W(\u03c3) is chosen independently and\nrandomly for each sequence. In contrast to simpler permutation in variant\nlandscapes [12], this makes it necessary to store all 2Nsequences during the\niteration of the evolution equations3, restricting our numerical treatment to\n3An approximate scheme which reduces the storage requirement fr om 2NtoNis de-\nscribed in [38].\n5\nrather short sequences; the results shown here are for N= 10. A systematic\nanalysis of the dependence on sequence length will be presented els ewhere\n[38].\n2 The strong selection limit\nThe form of the strong selection limit is motivated by the analogy with\nthe zero temperature limit in the associated problems of statistical physics.\nFollowingPeliti[11,21]weintroduceaninverse\u201cselectivetemperatu re\u201dk >0\nby writing the reproduction rates in the form\nW(\u03c3) =ekF(\u03c3). (5)\nWe want to take the strong selection limit k\u2192 \u221ein such a way that only a\nfew mutations occur in each time step. This requires to scale the mut ation\nrate as\n\u00b5=e\u2212k\u03b3(6)\nwhere\u03b3 >0 is a constant. Inserting (5) and (6) into (3) it is clear that the\nsequence concentrations will grow for large kas\nn\u03c3(t) =ekE(\u03c3,t). (7)\nIn the limit k\u2192 \u221ethe evolution equation (3) then reduces to the recursion\nE(\u03c3,t+1) = max\n\u03c3\u2032[E(\u03c3\u2032,t)+F(\u03c3\u2032)\u2212\u03b3dH(\u03c3,\u03c3\u2032)]. (8)\nSince the term \u2212\u03b3dHsuppresses mutations to far away sequences, we expect\nsimilar behavior for a model in which only nearest neighbor mutations a re\nallowed,\nE(\u03c3,t+1) = max\ndH(\u03c3,\u03c3\u2032)\u22641[E(\u03c3\u2032,t)+F(\u03c3\u2032)\u2212\u03b3dH(\u03c3,\u03c3\u2032)]. (9)\nAll results shown in this paper were obtained using the nearest neigh bor rule\n(9), with the parameter \u03b3set to unity4.\nWe still need to specify the probability distribution p(F) of the \ufb01tnesses\nF(\u03c3). Two choices will be considered: The exponential distribution p(F) =\ne\u2212F,F\u22650, and a uniform distribution on the interval [0 ,S], whereS= 2N.\nThe reason for this particular scaling of the width of the uniform dist ribution\nwill become clear below in Section 4.\n4For a discussion of the di\ufb00erences between the rules (8) and (9), s ee [38].\n6\n3 Evolutionary trajectories\nIt is evident from (7) that, in the strong selection limit k\u2192 \u221e, the entire\npopulation resides at the global maximum of the function E(\u03c3,t). The po-\nsition of this maximum in sequence space will be referred to as the mas ter\nsequence at time t, and denoted by \u03c3\u2217(t). At time t= 0 the master se-\nquence is placed at a randomly chosen point \u03c3(i)by setting E(\u03c3(i),t) = 0 and\nE(\u03c3,t) =\u2212\u221efor\u03c3/negationslash=\u03c3(i). The subsequent time evolution \u03c3\u2217(t) de\ufb01nes an\nevolutionary trajectory.\nInspection shows that, after one or two time steps, such a traje ctory\npasses exclusively through local \ufb01tness maxima, and eventually, af ter a total\nevolution time T, it invariably reaches the global \ufb01tness maximum. During\nthe evolution, the master sequence spends increasingly long time int ervals\nat local maxima of increasing \ufb01tness, with a few abrupt transitions in be-\ntween (Figure 1). The number of transitions is small (see Figure 5), much\nsmaller than the number of local \ufb01tness maxima, which is on average e qual\nto 2N/(N+1)\u224893 [30]. This implies that most local maxima are bypassed\nby a typical trajectory.\n01234567\n1 10 100 1000Fitness of local maxima\nNumber of visits at local maxima\nFigure 2: Fitness F(\u03c3) vs. the number of visits for all local maxima in a\n\ufb01tness landscape with exponential \ufb01tness distribution p(F). The particular\nlandscape used here is near degenerate (gap size \u01eb\u22480.02)\n7\nA quanti\ufb01cation of this statement is shown in Figure 2, in which the \ufb01t-\nnessFof local maxima is plotted against the number of times it is visited\nby an evolutionary trajectory. These data were generated by go ing through\nall possible starting points \u03c3(i)in a \ufb01xed \ufb01tness landscape. The \ufb01gure shows\na roughly linear correlation between the \ufb01tness of a maximum and the loga-\nrithm of the number of visits.\nIn relation to adaptive walks [30, 31, 32, 33], which respond only to th e\nrelative ordering of \ufb01tnesses and not to their actual values, it is of inter-\nest to ask to what extent the set of maxima visited by a given trajec tory\nis determined by the ordering of \ufb01tnesses. For this reason Figure 1 shows\ntwo trajectories evolving in landscapes which were generated using the same\nrandom numbers \u2013 thus having identical ordering of \ufb01tnesses \u2013 but with dif-\nferent \ufb01tness distributions. Itcanbeseen thattheset oflocal m axima visited\nby the two trajectories is almost identical, apart from a small detou r taken\nby the \u201cuniform\u201d trajectory, but the timing of the evolutionary tr ansitions is\nmarkedly di\ufb00erent in the two cases. With reference to G.G. Simpson\u2019s classic\ntreatise [23], we may say that the \ufb01tness distribution a\ufb00ects only th etempo,\nbut not the modeof quasispecies evolution. For a quantitative analysis of\nthe temporal aspects we next turn to the distribution of evolution times.\n4 Distribution of evolution times\nFigure 3 shows the distribution P(T) of the number of time steps Trequired\nto reach the global \ufb01tness maximum, obtained by averaging over 50 0000\nlandscapes with exponential and uniform \ufb01tness distributions. The time\ndistribution for the exponential case displays a distinct maximum aro und\nT= 7, followed by a slowly decaying tail which is well described by the\npower law\nP(T)\u223cT\u22122(10)\nover roughly two decades. The distribution for the uniform case is m uch\nbroader, but a similar power law tail can be seen for times T\u2265500.\nThe power law (10) appears to be a simple consequence of the order\nstatistics of uncorrelated \ufb01tness landscapes.

Inthelate\nstage of evolution the population will typically make a a transition from the\nsecond best sequence \u03c3(2)(or some local \ufb01tness maximum with comparable\n\ufb01tness5) to the globally optimal sequence \u03c3(1). From the evolution rule (9) it\nis easy to see that, for small \u01eb, this transition will require a time of the order\nof\nT\u2248a(N)/\u01eb, (12)\nwhere the coe\ufb03cient ais determined by the early stages of the evolution\nprocess [38]. Thus given the gapdistribution Pg(\u01eb) the tail of the distribution\nof evolution times can be estimated to be\nP(T)\u2248aT\u22122Pg(a/T), (13)\nand aT\u22122power law follows for T\u226ba, provided that 0 < Pg(0)<\u221e. The\ngap distribution is given by Pg(\u01eb) =e\u2212\u01ebbothfor exponentially distributed\n5In fact\u03c3(2)isa local \ufb01tness maximum with high probability 1 \u2212N/(2N\u22121)\u22480.990.\n9\n\ufb01tnesses, and for \ufb01tnesses distributed uniformly between 0 and S, whenSis\nlarge [39]. The striking di\ufb00erence between the two evolution time distr ibu-\ntions seen in Figure 3 is related to the di\ufb00erent scaling of the coe\ufb03cien ta(N)\nin (12) with sequence length: In the exponential case a(N)\u223cN3/2, while in\nthe uniform case a(N)\u223c\u221a\nNS[38].\nTo compute Pg(0) for general \ufb01tness distributions, note\ufb01rst that the joint\ndistribution of F(1)andF(2)is given by [40]\nP2(F(1),F(2)) =S(S\u22121)pc(F(2))S\u22122p(F(1))p(F(2)) (14)\nwherepc(F) =/integraltextF\n0dF\u2032p(F\u2032) denotes the cumulative \ufb01tness distribution. The\ncumulative gap distribution is obtained by integration,\nProb[F(1)\u2212F(2)< \u01eb] =\nS(S\u22121)/integraldisplay\u221e\n0dF(2)p(F(2))pc(F(2))S\u22122/integraldisplayF(2)+\u01eb\nF(2)dF(1)p(F(1)),(15)\nwhich tends to Pg(0)\u01ebfor\u01eb\u21920. Thus we conclude that\nPg(0) =S(S\u22121)/integraldisplay\u221e\n0dFp(F)2pc(F)S\u22122(16)\nwhich is clearly \ufb01nite and nonzero.\nThe relationship (13) implies that the near-degenerate \ufb01tness land scapes,\nwhich have very small gaps, are the ones that give rise to anomalous ly long\nevolution times. Figure 4 illustrates this connection. The data shown as\ncrosses were obtained from an average over exponential \ufb01tness landscapes,\nfor which the \ufb01tness gap \u01ebwas increased arti\ufb01cially by increasing the global\n\ufb01tness maximum according to F(1)\u2192F(1)+1. This is seen to immediately\nremove the power law tail (10).\n5 Comparison to record dynamics\nA simple schematic analogue of the nonstationary (ever slowing) evo lution\nprocess found in the quasispecies model is provided by the dynamics of\nrecords [34, 35, 36, 39], which is equivalent to evolution by long-rang ed ran-\ndom mutations known in the classical literature as the theory of \u201cho peful\nmonsters\u201d [23, 30]. In the present context it reduces to the follow ing rule\nfor the motion of the master sequence \u03c3\u2217(t) in sequence space: At each time\n10\n1e-050.00010.0010.010.1\n1 10 100P(T)\nTstandard\nnondegenerate\nFigure 4: Comparison of the distribution of evolution times for expon entially\ndistributed \ufb01tnesses (+) with an ensemble of landscapes for which n ear-\ndegeneracies (small gaps) have been removed ( \u00d7). The latter data were\naveraged over 50000 realizations\nstep, the population attempts a jump to another, randomly chose n sequence\n\u03c3\u2032/negationslash=\u03c3\u2217(t). The move is accepted, and \u03c3\u2217(t+1) =\u03c3\u2032, ifF(\u03c3\u2032)> F(\u03c3\u2217(t));\notherwise it is discarded and \u03c3\u2217(t+ 1) =\u03c3\u2217(t). Thus the current sequence\n\u03c3\u2217(t) represents the \ufb01tness record among the sequences which the population\nhas encountered so far.\nClearly this process gives rise to a step-like, punctuated pattern w hich is\nqualitatively similar to that shown above in Figure 1. Here we are concerned\nwith aquantitative comparison of statistical properties. Let us \ufb01rst com-\npute the probability distribution of the total evolution time Tfor the record\ndynamics. Since the probability of \ufb01nding the global \ufb01tness maximum in\nany jump is 1 /S, the probability that it has not been found up to time tis\n(1\u22121/S)t\u2248e\u2212t/Sfor large Sandt. Taking the derivative one obtains\nP(T) =S\u22121e\u2212T/S. (17)\nThetypical evolutiontimes areoftheorderofthenumber ofseque nces, much\nlarger than in the quasipecies model. This demonstrates impressively the\n\u201cguided\u201d nature of quasispecies evolution [7], which is much more e\ufb03cie nt\n11\n1e-050.00010.0010.010.11\n0 2 4 6 8 10probability\nnumber of transitionsexponential\nuniform\nhopeful monsters\nFigure 5: Probability distributions for the total number of evolution ary\njumps required to reach the global \ufb01tness maximum.

Figure 3 shows how broad the distribution (1 7) is\ncompared to that of the quasispecies model. Note, however, that for very\nlong times (longer than S) Eq.(17) decays exponentially, faster than the\ndegeneracy-induced power law (10). Taken literally, Eq.(10) implies t hat the\nmean evolution time is in\ufb01nite.\nNextweconsider thedistribution Pnofthetotalnumber nofevolutionary\njumps which occur on the way to the global \ufb01tness maximum.

(18)\nIn Figure 5 this is compared to numerical data obtained for the quas ispecies\nmodel. Again the distributions for the quasispecies dynamics are muc h nar-\nrower, showing that less transitions are required to reach the glob al max-\nimum. Simulations for longer sequences show that the mean number o f\n12\ntransitions increases sublinearly in N, more slowly than the linear behav-\nior predicted by (18) [38, 41].\n6 Outlook\nThe simplicity of the strong selection dynamics (8,9) suggests to use it for a\ndynamical characterization of di\ufb00erent kinds of \ufb01tness landscape s. In con-\ntrast to the random landscapes considered here, realistic \ufb01tness landscapes\nobtained e.g. from RNA folding contain extended neutral networks in se-\nquence space, in which the \ufb01tness (de\ufb01ned in terms of the RNA seco ndary\nstructure) does not change [42]. Central concepts of quasispec ies theory have\nbeen extended to such landscapes [43]. Extended neutrality provid es a dis-\ntinct mechanism for the appearance of punctuation patterns in ev olution,\nsince changes in the genotype do not show up in the phenotype, as lo ng as\nthe former moves within a neutral network [44].\nAnother interesting direction for further research inspired by th e analogy\nwith directed polymers is to include e\ufb00ects of environmental \ufb02uctua tions,\nwhich amounts to making the \ufb01tness landscape time-dependent [45]. In the\ndirected polymer analogy, the issue is the interplay between columnar disor-\nder, which is provided by the time-independent part of the landscap e, and\npointdisorder modeling the time-dependent variations [46]. It is well known\nthat point disorder can depin a polymer from an attractive columnar defect\nin much the same way as thermal \ufb02uctuations [47]. This suggests the in-\ntriguing possibility of an error threshold delocalization phenomenon in duced\nby environmental \ufb02uctuations.\nAcknowledgements. I would like to thank T.

However contrad ictory\nresultsin recent research indicate that thesituation may b emorecom-\nplex. We build here a simple mathematical model aimed at sett ling\nthe contradictions. The model is based on a neural network pa radigm,\nand is applied using Partial Di\ufb00erential Equations (PDE). We show\nhere that a TH1/TH2 paradigm is only an external view of a comp lex\nmultivariate system.\n2\n1 Introduction\nImmunologists generally agree that in the course of many autoimmun e dis-\neases, TH1 type cells have a damaging e\ufb00ect, whereas TH2 type cells have\na bene\ufb01cial e\ufb00ect [1]. Thus the disease is aggravated by a high ratio o f\nTH1/TH2 T cells and cytokines. This view is contradicted by many expe r-\nimental results showing an inverse e\ufb00ect [2]: TH2 type cells may enhan ce\ndisease, if administrated at a certain time [3], and TH1 type cells can st op\nthe evolution of the disease, if given at the appropriate time [4, 5]. Ot her\nworks show that gene knock-out mice with no INF \u03b3or TNF\u03b1still man-\nage to produce the pathological features of a TH1-dependent au toimmune\ndisease [6, 7]. Based on results from EAE (experimental autoimmune en-\ncephalomyelitis) [8] and insulin dependent diabetes melitus (IDDM) [9, 1 0]\nin Non Obese Diabetic (NOD) mice [11], we propose a larger model explain -\ning both the general agreement and the contradictory results. W e suggest\nthat the TH1 and TH2 cells are not the cause of the disease, but a ma rker\nfor a more general steady state. To settle the contradictions, w e use a nu-\nmerical model and general mechanisms of safe information transm ission [12]\nto explain the discrepancy in the case of gene knock-out mice. We sh ow the\nexplanatory power of our model andits ability to produce theknown features\nof TH1 type diseases.\n2 Model\nOur model is based on a neural network paradigm [13], where the ove rall\nsituation is not described by the properties of any one cell type, bu t by\nthe steady state of the network. We use PDE in order to get a cont inuous\ndescription of the network. Each cell in the network represents a class of cells\nwiththesamegeneralproperties, atleastfromthemostrelevant aspectofthe\nTH1/TH2 dichotomy. The model is an ad hoc description of the dynam ics,\nbut most of the links we use have some experimental backing. We built the\nmodel with the smallest number of cell types needed to explain qualita tively\nthe experimental results.\n3\n2.1 Experimental results\nEAE is an autoimmune disease studied mainly in rats and in mice, and is\nused as a model for human multiple sclerosis [14, 15] . In EAE, myelin in t he\nCNS becomes in\ufb02amed inducing paralysis and even death [16]. This disea se\nis classically de\ufb01ned by a TH1/TH2 dichotomy in which TH1 T cells induce\nthe disease whereas TH2 cells prevent it [1].\nClassical EAE experiments show that:\n\u2022EAE can be induced either by adoptive transfer of CD4 T cells from a\nsick rodent, or by active immunization by an injection of a myelin anti-\ngen in adjuvant to a healthy rodent [17]. We will show that these two\nprocedures lead, in fact, to two separate pathways of disease ind uction.\n\u2022Administration of free antigen arrests EAE [18]. We propose to show\nthat antigen-induced inhibition could be due to the e\ufb00ect of regulato ry\nanti-idiotypic (anti-id) suppressor cells.\n\u2022The disease can be prevented by the continuous administration of I L-4,\nwhich is a TH2 type cytokine thought to push the immune system into\na healthy TH2 dominated state REF FROM EAE[19]. But IL-4 can\nalso aggravate disease (see below).\nHowever, recentresearchresultsappeartocontradicttheclas sicalTH1/TH2\nhypothesis:\n\u2022A small amount of IL-4 administrated during disease induction can\nblock the suppressive e\ufb00ect of free antigen.[20] This paradox will be\nexplained by the e\ufb00ect of TH2 type cytokines on anti-id regulatory\ncells.\n\u2022A short administration of a TH1 cytokine can heal the disease [4, 5].\nThis e\ufb00ect too can be attributed to an anti-id regulatory cell.\n\u2022Gene knock-out mice, lacking one or some of the TH1 cytokines, can\nstill develop EAE or IDDM [6, 7]. This paradox will be explained by\nthe nature of regulation.\nThese facts regarding EAE are combined in our analysis with results\nregardingthestructureofid-anti-idcell interactions andthecyt okine pro\ufb01le\nexpressed during the evolution of IDDM in NOD mice [9, 10] , and in the\nmouse model of EAE [8, 21].\n4\n2.2 Cells and Cytokine Types\nOurmodel iscomposedof\ufb01vecelltypes, threecytokinetypesand theantigen\n(Table 1). The \ufb01rst cell type is the naive CD4 T cell that can di\ufb00erent iate\ninto the second and third cell types: TH1 and TH2 type CD4 T cells [22].\nTheanti-idcellsaregroupedasasinglecelltype, thefourthcelltyp e. Amore\ndetailedmodel shouldusenaive anti-idcells anddiverse anti-idcells sec reting\nTH1 type cytokines and TH2 type cytokines. For the sake of simplicit y,\nhowever, we group all anti-id cells into one cell type, and assume the y have\nthesamee\ufb00ect. SinceweknowfromIDDMandEAEthatanti-idcellsse crete\nmore TH1 cytokines than TH2 [10, 8] , we designate the anti-id popula tion\nas TH1 type cells. The CD4 T id cells can present themselves directly to\nthe anti-id cells [10]. The \ufb01fth type of cells are macrophages, which pla y\nadditional roles as APC [23] and as cytokine-secreting cells. The ant igen\nrepresents the quantity of antigen presented to the CD4 T cells. W e assume\nthat there is a large enough number of APCs so that the CD4 T cells ca n\nsee the antigen.\nThe three types of cytokines are:\n\u2022TH1 type cytokines that enhance the di\ufb00erentiation of naive cells int o\nTH1 type cells.\n\u2022TH2 type cytokines that enhance the development of TH2 type cells .\n\u2022Cytokines secreted by macrophages that enhance the proliferat ion and\ndi\ufb00erentiation of TH1 cells [24]. We shall ignore the e\ufb00ect of TH2 type\ncytokines secreted by macrophages (like IL-10) and the e\ufb00ects o f B\ncells. We will group together all the macrophage-derived cytokines as\ntype C cytokines.\n2.3 Model equations.\nWe compute the time derivatives of each cell type concentration xiand of\nthe cytokine concentration yi, assuming both are a\ufb00ected by all other cells\nand cytokines.\nx\u2032\ni= \u03a3wijxixj+max(\u03a3 w1ijxoriginixj,0)\u2212dixi (1)\ny\u2032\ni=max(\u03a3w2ijxj,0)\u2212diyi (2)\n5\nGroup Cell Type Notation\n1 Naive cells id - 0\n2 Idiotypic TH1 cells A\n3 Idiotypic TH2 cells B\n4 Anti-id cells anti-id\n5 Macrophages M\u03a6\n6 TH1 cytokines Cyt A\n7 TH2 cytokines Cyt B\n8Cytokines secreted by macrophages Cyt C\nTable 1: Cell types and cytokines. The cytokines are labeled accord ing to\nthe cell type producing them. We grouped cells as follows: TH1 id cells c an\ninclude all types of lymphocytes producing TH1 cytokines. Anti-id ce lls are\nall cell types speci\ufb01cally reactive to the id cells. They can either be cy totoxic\ncells, or limit the proliferation rate of the id cells.\nxoriginiis the origin of the cell number i (for example, the TH1 cells\noriginate in the naive cells, the naive cells originate in themselves). The\nother cells and cytokines can either induce or inhibit the proliferation of this\n(xi) cell type. The cytokines originate from the cells that secrete the m, so\nthat the right side of eq\u2019 2 is not multiplied by the cytokine concentra tion.\nThe secretion rate of the cytokines ( yi) by cells ( xj) is linear to the other\ncell and cytokine concentrations. For example, if TH2 type cytokin es inhibit\nthe production of TH1 cytokines, then we use a term in the equation for the\nTH1 cytokines \u2212w2ijx(th2), and we do not multiply the term by the TH1\ncytokine concentration.\nA cell\u2019s proliferation rate cannot be negative. Thus we de\ufb01ne the pro lif-\neration rate of any cell to be greater than 0. But of course, the n atural death\nrate (\u2212dixi) can lead to a decrease in the cell concentration. T he cytokine\nproduction rate ( y\u2032\ni) is assumed not to depend on the cytokine concentration,\nbut on the number of cells secreting the cytokine. The equations ar e solved\nnumerically using a second order precision scheme [25].\nWe start every computation at a steady state\nx\u2032\ni= 0,y\u2032\ni= 0 (3)\nSince the time constants in this process are short, we could assume that\nthe system had already reached a steady state before the appea rance of the\nautoimmune disease.\n6\nMacrophages do not reproduce during the response to the antige n but,\nrather,areattractedtothea\ufb00ectedregion[26],sothat,likethe cytokines,their\ngrowth rate is not multiplied by their own concentration.\nThedi\ufb00erencesbetweenpossiblemodelsareintheassignedweights wij,w1ij\nandw2ijin eq\u2019 1 and 2. But we have tried to use the most uniform de\ufb01nition\nof weights, and all the weights are of the same order of magnitude. If we had\nno special reason to believe that two weights of the same type were di\ufb00erent,\nwe \ufb01xed them at the same value (the e\ufb00ect of TH1 cells on TH1 cytokin es\nand the e\ufb00ect of TH2 cells on TH2 cytokines, for example). This was d one\nin order to limit the size of the parameter space.\n2.4 Model description\nThe structure of the model is simply a mathematical description of t he \ufb01nd-\ningsinIDDMandEAE.Thebasicpartofthemodelistheoppositionbet ween\nid cells and anti-id cells. The CD4 are the id cells and the naive CD4 popula-\ntionproliferatesproportionallytotheantigenconcentration. The suppressors\nare the anti-id cells, and they proliferate proportionally to the conc entration\nof id cells (Figure 1A).\nThe second division of this model is into TH1 and TH2 id cells. Both\nthe TH1 and TH2 cells originate from the naive id cell. The TH1 cell type is\nassociated with a TH1 cytokine type andthe TH2 cell type is associat ed with\na TH2 cytokine type. We assume that each cell enhances its own cyt okine\ntype [27] and inhibits the production of the opposing type. Each cyt okine\nencourages the production of the appropriate cell type and inhibit s the other\ntype (Figure 1B).\nThe macrophages have a double e\ufb00ect: They serve as APCs and act ivate\nnaive CD4 cells [23], and they secrete cytokines that enhance T cell d i\ufb00eren-\ntiation into TH1 type cells [28] (and inhibit di\ufb00erentiation into TH2 cells).\nThe macrophages are in\ufb02uenced by the TH1 cytokines, which activa te them\nto migrate into the in\ufb02ammatory site. Since macrophages respond t o TH1\ncytokine and are inhibited by TH2 cytokines, changes in the macroph age\nconcentration depend on the di\ufb00erences between the concentra tions of TH1\nand TH2 cytokine types.\nThe anti-id cells are of a TH1 type. This assumption is based on data\nfrom EAE and IDDM [10, 8]. We thus postulate that the anti-id cells are\ninhibited by TH2 type cytokines. And \ufb01nally, we assume that there is a basic\nconcentration and di\ufb00erentiation rate of CD4 cells into TH1 and TH2; but\n7\n1A 1B\n\u2717\n\u2716\u2714\n\u2715APC+Antigen\n\u2717\n\u2716\u2714\n\u2715Idiotopic cell\n\u2717\n\u2716\u2714\n\u2715Anti Id cell\u2744\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u273b\u2744\u2717\n\u2716\u2714\n\u2715APC+Antigen\n\u2717\n\u2716\u2714\n\u2715Naive Id cell\n\u2717\n\u2716\u2714\n\u2715Th1 Id cell\u2717\n\u2716\u2714\n\u2715Th2 Id cell\n\u2717\n\u2716\u2714\n\u2715Th1 cytokine\u2717\n\u2716\u2714\n\u2715Th2 cytokine\u2744\n\u2744 \u2744\u273b \u273b\u2744 \u2744\u273b \u273b\n\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\n\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2663\u2712 \u25a0\nFigure 1: The basic features of the model. 1A-Regulation of the id ce ll\npopulation by anti-id cells. 1B - Competition between TH1 T cells and TH2\nT cells.

The model is based on a TH1/TH2\nbalance. If the TH1 concentration is too high the target organ is at tacked. If\nthere is a high TH2 concentration, the target organ remains health y. Dotted\nlines indicate inhibition; full lines indicate stimulation. There is also an\ninhibition of TH2 on the production of TH1 and vice versa, but these lin es\nwere not drawn in order not to overload the graph.\n9\nTH2 steady state is associated with relatively low concentrations of reacting\ncells. Nevertheless the id and ant-id cells are still reacting at the sam e rate,\nbut at a lower concentration. In other words the healthy state me rely looks\nlike it is at rest; on the contrary health like disease is a state of intera ctions\n[29].\nWhen we administer cells or antigen and adjuvant, we push the syste m\ntoward the TH1 state (Figure 4). Following administration of T cells, w hich\nare primarily TH1 type cells, the number of TH1 cells is high enough to\nstart the production of TH1 cytokines that inhibit the TH2 cytokine s. The\nsystem then falls into the TH1 steady state, which is the diseased st ate.\nAnother way to induce disease is to immunize the animal with antigen an d\nadjuvant. We propose that the adjuvant stimulates macrophage s to produce\nC type cytokines. The antigen together with the cytokines induces CD4 T\ncell proliferationanddi\ufb00erentiation into TH1 cells, bringing thesyste m again\nto a TH1 type steady state.\nOne way to heal the disease is to administer free antigen (Figure 5) in\nan amount that can raise the total number of naive CD4 cells that be come\nTH1 CD4 cells. The resulting high concentration of CD4 cells will activat e\nan increase in the number of anti-id cells. At this point, we assume tha t the\nlifespan of the anti-id cells is longer than that of the CD4 cells; the num ber of\nanti-id cells will remain high even after the number of CD4 id cells decrea ses\n(due to the fall in antigenic stimulation). Once the total number of C D4 cells\nis below a certain threshold, the system returns by itself to the hea lthy TH2\nsituation.The basic situation is the TH2 situation.\nThe return to a TH2 state, following antigen administration, can be p ara-\ndoxically inhibited by the administration of IL-4 with the antigen (Figur e 6).\nThe reason is as follows: When we administer IL-4 (which is represent ed\nby type B cytokines), we inhibit the production of anti-id cells. In the ab-\nsence of a su\ufb03cient number of anti-id cells, the number of CD4 e\ufb00ect ors cells\nremains above the threshold and the system stays in a TH1 state. I f, how-\never, the quantity of IL-4 is high enough to overcome TH1 dominanc e and\nstarts activating TH2 T cells directly, then the TH1 cell concentrat ion will\ndecrease due to the production of TH2 cytokines by the newly form ed TH2\ncells, despite the low number of anti-id cells.\nThe administration of anti-IL-4 antibody with the antigen can parad oxi-\ncally act in a manner similar to the administration of IL-4 with the antige n.\nNote that in both cases the inhibition of disease is weaker than the e\ufb00 ect of\nadministrating free antigen.

IL4 has a double role in this case.

The\ne\ufb00ect of the antigen is then as described at the beginning of the sec tion; the\nantigen induces a sharp rise in the concentration of id CD4 cells, and f ollow-\ning the id CD4 cells, the anti-id cell concentration raises. These anti- id cells\nproduce a long term decrease in the concentration of the CD4 id cells . At\na later stage, when the concentration of CD4 id cells has decreased to a low\nlevel, the e\ufb00ect of the anti-IL-4 antibody becomes important. The level of\nid CD4 TH1 type cells at this stage is low, and the system should now sta rt\nto produce TH2 type cells and cytokines. However the anti-IL-4 an tibody\nnow inhibits the production of IL-4, and the system has a lower prob ability\nto return to a TH2 state.\nJust as the administration of TH2 cytokines can inhibit the transition\nback to a TH2 state, the administration of TH1 cytokines can rise th e prob-\nability of such a transition. The continuous administration of TH1 cyt okines\nwill of course keep the cytokines in the TH1 pro\ufb01le and induce or enha nce\nthe disease. Administration of the TH1 cytokines at the onset of th e disease\n(Figure 7) will lead to an increase in the production rate of TH1 id CD4\ncells; the high concentration of TH1 cells will raise the concentration of the\nanti-id cells, which will later feed back to decrease the concentratio n of CD4\nid cells. If the CD4 id cell concentration decreases to a low level, the s ys-\ntem will return to its natural steady state, which is a TH2 steady st ate, as\ndescribed above.\nThe administration of some cytokines has been shown to have no obs erv-\nable e\ufb00ect on the system. This does not mean that these cytokines have no\nimportant role in the dynamics of this system. In fact the lack of an o bserv-\nable e\ufb00ect can be due to a high endogenous concentration of the cy tokines;\nadding additional amounts cannot enhance the e\ufb00ect.\nAdministration of a cytokine may have no e\ufb00ect if the cytokine conce n-\ntration is close to, or above its threshold for causing an e\ufb00ect. For example,\nadministration of IL-12 at the onset of disease may have no e\ufb00ect if the IL-12\ne\ufb00ect is already at its maximum. Paradoxically in this case, the administ ra-\ntion of a low dose of anti-IL-12 antibody will also have no e\ufb00ect, since the\nprecise concentration of the molecule is not important. A large chan ge in the\nconcentration of the molecule leads to a small change in its e\ufb00ects. T his can\nbe understood if the e\ufb00ect is bell shaped as a function of the conce ntration.\nAt low concentrations, a small change in the concentration leads to a large\nchange in the function value. However at the top of the bell, a large c hange\nin the concentration leads to very small change in the function value .\n15\n012\n0120100200300\nTH1TH1 steady stateTH1 vs TH2 concentration as a function of time.\nTH2TH2 steady statetime\n0 50 100 15000.511.522.5Concentration of cytokines\ntime [arbitrary units]TH1 cytokines\nTH2 cytokines\nC cytokines  \n0 50 100 15000.511.52Concentration of antigen, id and anti\u2212id cells\ntimeid cells     \nanti\u2212id cells\nfree antigen \n0.511.52\n00.511.50100200300\nanti\u2212id cellTH1 steady stateConcentration of id vs anti\u2212id cells\nid celltimeTH2 steady state\nFigure 7: Healing by administrating TH1 cytokines.

The notat ion used in\nthis \ufb01gure is identical to the notation used in \ufb01gure 3.\n16\n2.6 Redundancy and gene knock-out mice\nGene knock-out mice lacking some of the TH1 cytokines can still deve lop\na TH1-dependent disease. However this does not contradict the m odel we\npresented, which describes the evolution of the disease as the tra nsition to\na TH1 type cytokine pro\ufb01le. The cytokines in this model are describe d\nas a group with the same approximate action. Even if such a group lac ks\none of its components, the e\ufb00ect of the group as a whole is not alter ed.\nThe TH1/TH2 phenotype does not depend on a single cytokine, since the\nconcentration of each one of the TH1 and TH2 cytokines can chang e by a\nlarge number of mechanisms. The immune system cannot a\ufb00ord to ch ange\nits general phenotype each time an external factor modi\ufb01es the c oncentration\nof a single cytokine. The immune system achieves its robustness to e xternal\nchanges in the cytokine pro\ufb01le through redundancy [29]. A large num ber of\ncytokines can each have common e\ufb00ects. Thus a certain result can occur\neven if not all the cytokines leading to the e\ufb00ect are expressed.\nIndeed, the fact that the body uses many redundant cytokines c an have a\nlarger meaning. Consider that the e\ufb00ects mediated by cytokines ha ve at least\ntwo functions. The \ufb01rst function is to maintain a healthy steady sta te, and\nthe second function relates to the \ufb01ne details of the steady state . In normal\nbehavior, the changes are felt at the level of the details, but in ext reme\nsituations, like the response to an external pathogen, the body w ill try to\nchange its total steady state and produce a fast and strong res ponse.\n3 Discussion\n3.1 Regulation of autoimmunity\nThis paper presents a simpli\ufb01ed model of thekinetics ofthe concent rations of\nthe main cell and cytokine types in the evolution of a TH1 type autoimm une\ndisease. It shows thateven simple dynamics canexplainmanyofthec omplex\nfeatures in the evolution of the response. We have grouped the ma jor cells\nand cytokines into single types, although there are obviously di\ufb00ere nces in\nthe roles taken by each one of the cells we have grouped together. This\nmodel ignores the e\ufb00ects of localization and of tissue barriers (for example,\ntheblood/brainbarrier inEAE) in inhibiting the passage ofsome of cells and\nallowing others. We did not take into account the e\ufb00ects of the tissu e cells\n(for example astrocytes in EAE, or islet cells in IDDM), of the cytokin es they\n17\nsecrete, and of B cells and antibodies. Some major mechanisms were ignored\nincluding anergy and the release of free antigen due to cell destruc tion.\nAll these simpli\ufb01cations render this a general feature model rathe r than\na precise quantitative description of the cell concentrations. Our model is\nbuilt on a double system of positive and negative feedback between id and\nanti-id cells, and between TH1 and TH2 states. Such a structure co uld\nbe the basic feature of the selection between TH1 and TH2 for a gro up of\nimportant antigens in the body. This model seems to describe the sit uation\nboth in EAE and in IDDM, and we have no reason to believe that it is\nnot general. Negative feedback keeps the general concentratio ns of all kinds\nof cells within reasonable limits, and positive feedback enables the sys tem\nto mount a fast enough response to an antigen when needed. With t his\nstructure, it is possible to maintain a population of T cells responding t o\nself-antigens of the body, keeping them in a TH2 state where they m ay be\nrestrained.\n3.2 Models\nThis kind of model shows the complex dynamics attained even by a sma ll\nsystem containing only 5 cell types and 3 cytokine types. It shows t hat\neven small systems need a kinetic description, and the system cann ot be\nunderstood by an overall estimation of the e\ufb00ect of one cell type o n the\nothers. Such models must be robust to changes in parameters, sin ce it is\nobvious that the interactions between the cells in the body are not p recisely\n\ufb01xed and that the cells are constantly subjected to chemical noise impinging\nonthem. Nevertheless, the body must keep its general steady st ate, although\nthe precise quantity of any cell is not very important.\n3.3 Feedback loops\nThe present type of modeling shifts our attention from the number s of each\ncell type to the global state of the immune system, which most of th e time\nshould be in some quasi-equilibrium between many opposing in\ufb02uences. The\nway to analyze such a global state is by positive and negative feedba ck loops\nand the interactions between them. According to this formalism, ou r model\ncan be described as a large negative feedback loop, built of 4 interna l loops :\n\u2022The id-anti-id cell negative feedback loop, in which are nested three\n18\npositive and one negative feedback loop.

INTRODUCTION\nDielectric spectroscopy has become a quantitative method of real- time monitoring of cell\ngrowth in suspensions [1\u20133]. The real-time monitoring has advantage s over conventional\ntechniques and would be important to investigate the dynamic behav ior of cell growth.\nThere are many factors that may in\ufb02uence the dielectric behavior o f biological materials:\nstructure, orientation of dipoles, surface conductances, memb rane transport processes, etc.\nAll these factors in\ufb02uence one another and it is di\ufb03cult to separate out the e\ufb00ect of a single\none. However, some e\ufb00ects can be dominant at certain ranges of f requencies. For instance,\nthe dielectric dispersion spectrum of living cell suspensions in radiofr equencies is mainly\ndetermined by the cell shape. The objective of this work is to develo p a theory for such\ncorrelation, on which new applications in biotechnology rely.\nMore recently, Asami [4] reported that the dielectric dispersion sp ectrum of \ufb01ssion yeast\ncells in a suspension was mainly composed of two sub-dispersions. The experimental data\nrevealed that the low-frequency sub-dispersion depended on the cell length, while the high-\nfrequency one was independent of it. Asami adopted a shell-ellipsoid model [3], in which an\nellipsoid is covered with an insulating shell as the electrical model of no nspherical biological\ncells. The comparison between model calculation [3] and experimenta l data [4] was far from\nbeing satisfactory. Asami suggested that the discrepancy is att ributed to the rod-like cell\nshape. However, the depolarization factor needed in his theory is d i\ufb03cult to calculate for\ncells of rod-like shape because of lack of available theories.\nIn this work, we propose the use of the spectral representation [5] for analyzing the cell\nmodels. The spectral representation is a rigorous mathematical f ormalism of the e\ufb00ective\ndielectric constant of a two-phase composite material [5]. It o\ufb00ers the advantage of the\nseparationofmaterialparameters(namelythedielectric constan tandconductivity) fromthe\ncell structure information, thus simplifying the study. From the sp ectral representation, one\ncan readily derive the dielectric dispersion spectrum, with the disper sion strength as well as\nthe characteristic frequency being explicitly expressed in terms of the structure parameters\n2\nand the materials parameters of the cell suspension (see section I II below). The actual\nshape of the real and imaginary parts of the permittivity over the r elaxation region can be\nuniquely determined by the Debye relaxation spectrum, parametriz ed by the characteristic\nfrequencies and the dispersion strengths. So, we can study the im pact of these parameters\non the dispersion spectrum directly.\nII. FORMALISM\nA. Spectral representation theory\nWe consider a two-component composite dielectric with complex dielec tric constant \u01eb(r)\nequal to \u01eb2=\u03b52+\u03c32/j2\u03c0fin the host medium and \u01eb1=\u03b51+\u03c31/j2\u03c0fin the embedding\nmedium. Aninterface\u03a3separatesthetwomedia. Inauniformapplied electric \ufb01eld E=E0\u02c6z\n(for convenience, let E0=\u22121), the electrostatic potential satis\ufb01es the Laplace\u2019s equation:\n\u2207\u00b7[(1\u22121\ns\u03b7(r))\u2207\u03a6(r)] = 0, (1)\nwheres=\u01eb2/(\u01eb2\u2212\u01eb1) denotes the relevant material parameter and \u03b7(r) is the characteristic\nfunction of the composite, having value 1 for rin the embedding medium and 0 otherwise.\nThe electric potential \u03a6( r) can be solved formally as:\n\u03a6(r) = \u03a60(r)+1\ns/integraldisplay\ndr\u2032\u03b7(r\u2032)\u2207\u2032G0(r\u2212r\u2032)\u00b7\u2207\u2032\u03a6(r\u2032) (2)\nwhereG0(r\u2212r\u2032) = 1/4\u03c0|r\u2212r\u2032|is the free space Green\u2019s function, and \u03a6 0(r) =r\u00b7\u02c6z=z\nis the potential of the unperturbed uniform \ufb01eld E. It is instructive to convert the volume\nintegration into the surface integration via the Green\u2019s second iden tity and only deal with\nthe potential on the interface \u03a3 [6]. We denote an integral-di\ufb00erent ial operator \u0393:\n\u0393\u03a6(r) =/contintegraldisplay\u2032\n\u03a3dS\u2032\u00b7\u2207\u2032G0(r\u2212r\u2032)\u03a6(r\u2032)+1\n2\u03a6(r),r\u2208\u03a3, (3)\ntoavoidthesingularityof G0(r\u2212r\u2032)whentheintegrationvariable r\u2032approachesthepointof r\n[6]. The integration with a \u201cprime\u201d denotes the restricted integratio n which excludes r\u2032=r.\n3\nLet \u03a8n(r) andsnbe thenth eigenfunction and eigenvalue of the \u0393 operator respectively. We\ncan expand \u03a6 0(r) and \u03a6(r) on the interface \u03a3 in a series expansion of eigenfunction \u03a8 n(r):\n\u03a60(r) =/summationdisplay\nnzn\u03a8n(r), (4)\n\u03a6(r) =/summationdisplay\nnszn\ns\u2212sn\u03a8n(r), (5)\nwhereznare the expansion coe\ufb03cients.

Note that Ezis a dimensionless\nelectric \ufb01eld because E0=\u22121. The eigenvalue snand the spectral function fncan be\nproved to be real and satisfy simple properties that 0 < sn<1,fn>0 and/summationtextfn= 1. We\nshall show that both the spectral function fnand the eigenvalue sndetermine the dielectric\nbehavior of cell suspensions.\nB. Cells with an axis of revolution\nNow the principal problem is to calculate the eigenvalue snand the spectral function fn.\nFor many cells interacting with one another, it is a formidable task. Ho wever, in the limit\nof a dilute cell suspension and weak applied \ufb01eld, one can regard the c ells in suspension\nas being noninteracting and randomly oriented and the problem is red uced to that of a\nsingle cell. We will consider cells with an axis of revolution, namely, the sp heroidal and the\nspherocylinder cells [7] to mimic cells of rod-like shape. The prolate sph eroid is generated\nby rotating an ellipse around its major axis, while the spherocylinder is obtained by \ufb01tting\n4\ntwo hemispherical caps at both ends of a circular cylinder. For a pro late spheroid, the\neigenvalues and eigenfunctions can be calculated exactly. The only n onzerofnequals unity\nforEbeing along the major or minor axis of the prolate spheroid, and the c orresponding\neigenvalues are given by:\nsz=\u22121\nq2\u22121+qln[q+(q2\u22121)1/2]\n(q2\u22121)3/2, (10)\nsx= (1\u2212sz)/2. (11)\nwhereqis the length to diameter ratio; zandxrefer to the direction along the major and\nminor axis respectively. For a spherocylinder, the consideration of the symmetry properties\nof the cell will help us choose the appropriate orthogonal basis for calculating the matrix\nelements of the \u0393 operator. Because of the rotation symmetry ab out the major axis of the\nspherocylinder, the eigenfunction is necessarily of the form ( ancosn\u03b8+bnsinn\u03b8)f(x) with\nnbeing an integer. Due to the inversion symmetry of the cell, f(x) must be either odd or\neven functions. It is convenient to expand f(x) in a series of Legendre polynomials Pm(x/l),\nwhere 2listhelengthofthecell. The applieduniform\ufb01eld Ecanalways beresolved into two\ncomponents along the major and minor axes of the spherocylinder, so we can calculate the\nsnandfnforEalong the major and minor axes separately. By symmetry, in order t o obtain\na nonzero fn, the eigenfunction should be the form of/summationtextAmP2m+1(x/l) forEbeing along\nthe major axis, while it reads cos \u03b8/summationtextBmP2m(x/l) forEbeing along the minor axis, with\nm= 0,1,2,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7. Using this orthogonal basis, we can calculate a truncated matrix a ccording\nto the precision needed. We should remark that the matrix is genera lly nonsymmetric.\nIII. DIELECTRIC DISPERSION SPECTRUM\nWe show here that from the spectral representation, one can re adily derive the dielectric\ndispersion spectrum. Substituting \u01eb1=\u03b51+\u03c31/j2\u03c0fand\u01eb2=\u03b52+\u03c32/j2\u03c0f(\u03b5and\u03c3being\nthe real and imaginary parts of the complex dielectric constant) int o Eq.(9), de\ufb01ning a new\nparameter t=\u03c32/(\u03c32\u2212\u03c31) and re-de\ufb01ning s=\u03b52/(\u03b52\u2212\u03b51), we rewrite thee\ufb00ective dielectric\nconstant \u01ebafter simple manipulations:\n5\n\u01eb=\u01ebH+/summationdisplay\nn\u2206\u01ebn\n1+jf/fcn+\u03c3L\nj2\u03c0f, (12)\nwhere\u01ebHand\u03c3Lare the high-frequency dielectric constant and the low-frequenc y con-\nductivity respectively, while \u2206 \u01ebnare the dispersion magnitudes, fc\nnare the characteristic\nfrequencies of the nth sub-dispersion.\nWe have already shown that there are only two poles in the spectral representation of\nthe prolate spheroids. In what follows, we will show that there are t wo dominant poles in\nthe spectral representation of the spherocylinder and hence th ere are two sub-dispersions in\nthe dielectric dispersion spectrum. The dispersion magnitudes and d ispersion frequencies\nare given by:\n\u2206\u01eb1=1\n3p\u03b52s1(s\u2212t)2\ns(s\u2212s1)(t\u2212s1)2, (13)\n\u2206\u01eb2=2\n3p\u03b52s2(t\u2212s)2\ns(s\u2212s2)(t\u2212s2)2, (14)\nfc\n1=\u03c32s(t\u2212s1)\n2\u03c0\u03b52t(s\u2212s1), (15)\nfc\n2=\u03c32s(t\u2212s2)\n2\u03c0\u03b52t(s\u2212s2). (16)\nThus, we are able to obtain the dispersion strengths as well as the c haracteristic frequencies\nexplicitly in terms of the structure parameters and the materials pa rameters of the cell\nsuspension.\nThe dielectric dispersion spectrum of a dilute suspension of prolate s pheroids is mainly\ncomposed of two sub-dispersions, namely, szis responsible for the lower frequency one and\nsxfor the higher one. For a spherocylinder, we obtain a nonvanishing s eries offnandsn.\nAlong the major axis, f1is dominant for all qand we can omit the smaller ones. This\ndominant f1is plotted in Fig.1 against q, and the corresponding szare plotted in Fig.2,\ntogether with the exact result of a prolate spheroid. As is evident in Fig.1, we can see that\nthe di\ufb00erence between the two models is indeed small. Along the minor a xis, the solution\nbecomes more complicated. The dominant f2nearq= 1 decreases quickly as qincreases;\nanotherf3increases and takes over at large q. These two fnare also plotted in Fig.1 and\n6\ntheir corresponding eigenvalues are plotted in Fig.3. As shown in Fig.3, the two eigenvalues\ntend to that of a prolate spheroid in the limit of both small and large q.\nNearq= 2, the two fnhave comparable values, resulting in two sub-dispersions at higher\nfrequency. These sub-dispersions can interfere with each other , rendering it di\ufb03cult to \ufb01nd\nthe characteristic frequencies of the di\ufb00erent sub-dispersions. Physically, the local \ufb01eld is\nthe most nonuniform in this case. Nevertheless, we will consider cells of large length and\nomit this complication.\nWith Eqs.(13)\u2013(16), it is easy to calculate the e\ufb00ect of the rod-like c ell structure on the\ndispersion spectrum and to compare with experiment data. We will sh ow that the sphero-\ncylinder model does give some improvement towards the experiment al result. However, the\nimprovement is too small to close up the gap as Asami expected. In f act, we shall see that\nAsami omitted the material parameters which will play an important r ole in the experimen-\ntal condition. By introducing the conductivity contrast t=\u03c32/(\u03c32\u2212\u03c31), we found that a\nsmall negative t, i.e.\u03c31\u226b\u03c32, should be used to close up the discrepancy.\nWe estimate tandsby \ufb01tting Eqs.(13)\u2013(16) to the experimental ratio of \u2206 \u01eb1/\u2206\u01eb2and\nfc\n2/fc\n1, and we get t=\u22120.0014 and s= 5.0. It means that \u03c31\u2248700\u03c32and\u03b51\u22480.80\u03b52.\nThe enhanced conductivity of cell cytoplasm is attributed to the me mbrane potential. The\nresult is in contrast to the previous (unjusti\ufb01ed) claim that \u03c31\u2248\u03c32.\nTable I lists the \u2206 \u01eb1/\u2206\u01eb2ratio and fc\n2/fc\n1ratio for both experimental and theoretical\nresults. Using the \ufb01tting material parameters, the improvement is obvious for both the\nprolate spheroid model and the spherocylinder model, while the di\ufb00er ence between the two\nmodels is quite small.\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION\nIn this work, we have applied the spectral representation to the d ielectric dispersion of\nsuspensions of \ufb01ssion yeast cells. As mentioned by Asami [4], the disc repancies between\ntheory and experiment may be attributed to the rod-like cell shape . For cells of noncon-\n7\nventional shape, however, there exists no available cell model in th e literature and we must\ndevelop the spectral representation from \ufb01rst principles.\nMore precisely, we have developed a Green\u2019s function formalism [6,8] f or calculating\nthe spectral representation of rods of \ufb01nite length. We modelled t he rod-like cells as the\nspherocylinders, i.e., circular cylinders with two hemispherical caps a t both ends. We solved\nthe spectral representation of the e\ufb00ective dielectric constant from \ufb01rst principles. Similar\nformalism was adopted for cell suspensions near their sub-division p oint [9\u201311].\nGenerallyspeaking, whentheaxialratio qislargerthan4, theprolatespheroidmodelcan\nbe employed as a good approximation for rod-like cell structures. F orq <4, the dielectric\nbehavior will become more sensitive to the cell structure of the sus pending particles, and\nthere are more sub-dispersions than that of the prolate spheroid suspensions.\nOur model does not include the rotational or vibrational e\ufb00ects, a nd our results are\nexpected to be valid only for weak electric \ufb01elds. Our model also ignor es the multi-shell\nnature of the cells. Usually the multi-shell model is used to explain the high-frequency\nsteps of spherical cell suspensions. Similar conclusions were found in one of our previous\npaper on multi-shell dielectric spheres in electrorheological (ER) \ufb02u ids [12] to account for\nthe e\ufb00ects of water coating on the ER e\ufb00ects. In Ref. [12], we also s howed that the spectral\nrepresentation can still be used for multi-shell model, albeit with a slig ht modi\ufb01cation.\nIn Asami\u2019s experiment, there exist three subdispersions, the highe st frequency step\n(above 10MHz) is due to the vacuole and cell wall as mentioned by Asa mi, while the two\nlower frequency step is evidently dependent on the cell shape. And the disperson magnitude\nof the highest frequency step is much smaller than that of the two lo wer frequency ones.\nSo one expects that the multi-shell model has only a small e\ufb00ect on t he lower frequency\nsteps. In fact the multi-shell model was used in Asami\u2019s theory, but the discrepancy, as we\nmentioned in the text, is still large.\nThe large cytoplasmic conductivity is a key result of our investigation . We believe that\nthe large cytoplasmic conductivity is reasonable because the cells ha ve to maintain a higher\nion concentration in their cytoplasm to avoid the shrinkage of cells du e to a loss of water\n8\nacross the cell membrane. However, to our knowledge, there exis ts no direct experimental\nmesurement on the cytoplasmic conductivity. In our work, we prop ose a convenient and\npracticalmeansofdetermining thecytoplasmic conductivity fromt hedielectric spectroscopy\ndata, which analysis can be important for biotechnology.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported in part by the Direct Grant for Research o f the Research\nCommittee and inpart by theResearch GrantsCouncil ofthe Hong K ongSAR Government.\nK.W.Y. acknowledges useful conversation with Professor G.

Of particular interes t are methods which\nallow the calculation of the information that can be conveyed by a give n neural structure,\nas these o\ufb00er both useful intuitions and the prospect of conduct ing pertinent experiments\n[6]. The replica trick [7] has been used to achieve this in the case of bina ry units [5] and\nthreshold-linear units [8,9], by appealing to an assumption of replica sy mmetry. In the\ncase of binary units with continuous inputs, the validity of the replica -symmetric ansatz is\njusti\ufb01ed by the duality with the Gardner calculation of the storage c apacity for continuous\ncouplings [2,5,10]. We now analyse the stability of the replica symmetric s olution for mutual\ninformation in a network of threshold-linear units.\nThemodeldescribesafeedforwardnetworkofthreshold-linearu nitswithpartiallydiluted\nconnectivity. This is a simpler version of the calculation described in [8,9 ]. In the calculation\nconsidered here, there is only one mode of operation (which we might call \u201ctransmission\u201d),\nas opposed to the division into storage and recall modes in that calcu lation. There are N\ncells in the input layer, and M(proportional to N) in the output layer. The limit of interest\nisN\u2192 \u221e.\n{\u03b7i}arethe \ufb01ring rates of each cell iinthe input layer.

(26)\nThe Gaussian channel information provides an upper limit correspon ding to the optimal \u03b7\ndistribution (for transmitting maximal information given a constrain t on the signal power),\nand no dependence upon the same inputs of the output cells.\nWithin the linear limit, we can consider the special case of high noise var iance (low signal\nto noise ratio). As \u03c32\n\u01eb\u2192 \u221e,\n6\n\u02dcz1\u223c\u03c32\nJCr\n\u03c32\u01eb, (27)\nand\nz1\u2243 /an}bracketle{t\u03b7/an}bracketri}ht2+O(\u02dcz1).

We thus can se e that for linear\nneurons with low signal to noise ratio, the transmitted information a pproaches the Gaussian\nchannel limit.1\nThe numerical solution of the mutual information expression, as a f unction of the noise\nvariance, is shown in Fig. 1, both for the case of linear units and for u nits with a threshold of\n\u03be0=\u22120.4, representing threshold-linear behaviour. This is shown for a bina ry pattern dis-\ntribution of sparseness a, where the sparseness of a distribution is a mean-invariant measur e\nof spread and is de\ufb01ned in general as\na=/an}bracketle{t\u03b7/an}bracketri}ht2\n\u03b7\n/an}bracketle{t\u03b72/an}bracketri}ht\u03b7. (30)\nThis measure is \u2018more sparse\u2019 for smaller a, and reduces to the fraction of units \u2018on\u2019 in the\ncase of a binary distribution. The Gaussian channel bound appears on the same graphs for\ncomparison.\nThe mutual information should be bounded by the pattern entropy as the noise vari-\nance becomes very small. As the noise variance decreases, the rep lica-symmetric solution\napproaches this bound in both the linear and threshold-linear cases . It can be seen, how-\never, that for very small noise variances, the replica-symmetric s olution changes direction\nand crosses this physical boundary. Inspection of Eq. 21 reveals divergence of the mutual\ninformation solution in the limit \u03c32\n\u01eb\u21920; this is in keeping with our intuition from the\nbeginning that the calculation should not be valid in the deterministic limit . However, for\nsuch low noise variance the information has essentially saturated in a ny case. For threshold-\nlinear neurons, the solution is also unstable to replica-symmetry-br eaking \ufb02uctuations for\nrelatively low noise variance, as will be discussed in the next section.\nIV. STABILITY OF THE REPLICA-SYMMETRIC SOLUTION\nThe stability of the replica-symmetric solution is analysed after the s tyle of de Almeida-\nThouless [11]. For the solution for free energy this was addressed in the context of Hop\ufb01eld-\nLittle type autoassociative neural networks in [1], and for an autoa ssociator with threshold-\nlinear units and for a threshold-linear variant of the Sherrington-K irkpatrick model in [12].\n1It can also be shown (we have done so for the case of a Gaussian \u03b7distribution), that as r\u21920,\nthe Gaussian channel bound is also reached.\n7\nFor the solution for another quantity, the Gardner volume, this wa s addressed in [2] for Ising\n(\u00b11) neurons. In contrast, here we are determining the stability of t he solution for mutual\ninformation in a network comprised of threshold-linear neurons, alt hough the technique\nproceeds very similarly.\nFluctuations in the transverse (replica-symmetry breaking, RSB) and longitudinal\n(replica-symmetric, RS) directions are decoupled, and hence can b e analysed separately.\nLongitudinal \ufb02uctuations can be disregarded [11,13] if a unique sadd le-point is obtained,\nwhich appears to be the case. We will therefore concentrate upon transverse \ufb02uctuations.\nWe wish to consider small deviations in the saddle-point parameters a bout the replica-\nsymmetric saddle-point,\nz\u03b1\u03b2=z1+\u03b4z\u03b1\u03b2\n\u02dcz\u03b1\u03b2= \u02dcz1+\u03b4\u02dcz\u03b1\u03b2(31)\nQuadratic \ufb02uctuations in the function\nB(z\u03b1,\u02dcz\u03b1,z\u03b1\u03b2,\u02dcz\u03b1\u03b2) =iN/summationdisplay\n\u03b1z\u03b1\u02dcz\u03b1+iN/summationdisplay\n(\u03b1\u03b2)z\u03b1\u03b2\u02dcz\u03b1\u03b2\u2212NHB(\u02dcz\u03b1,\u02dcz\u03b1\u03b2)\u2212MG(z\u03b1,z\u03b1\u03b2).(32)\ngive us the stability matrix\n\u0393=\uf8ee\n\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f0\u22022B\n\u2202z\u03b1\u03b2\u2202z\u03b3\u03b4\u22022B\n\u2202z\u03b1\u03b2\u2202(i\u02dcz\u03b3\u03b4)\n\u22022B\n\u2202(i\u02dcz\u03b1\u03b2)\u2202z\u03b3\u03b4\u22022B\n\u2202(i\u02dcz\u03b1\u03b2)\u2202(i\u02dcz\u03b3\u03b4)\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb=/bracketleftbiggA(\u03b1\u03b2)(\u03b3\u03b4)\u03b4(\u03b1\u03b2)(\u03b3\u03b4)\n\u03b4(\u03b1\u03b2)(\u03b3\u03b4)B(\u03b1\u03b2)(\u03b3\u03b4)/bracketrightbigg\n(33)\nwhere\u03b4(\u03b1\u03b2),(\u03b3\u03b4)=\u03b4\u03b1\u03b3\u03b4\u03b2\u03b4+\u03b4\u03b1\u03b4\u03b4\u03b2\u03b3. In constrast to previous calculations based on quantities\nsuch as free energy, the expression for mutual information involv esn+1 replicas. There are\nn(n+1)/2 independent variables z\u03b1\u03b2, and the same number of independent \u02dc z\u03b1\u03b2.\u0393is thus\nann(n+1)\u00d7n(n+1) matrix.\nThe transverse eigenvalues of this matrix are given by the eigenvalu es of the matrix\n/parenleftbigg\u03bbA1\n1\u03bbB/parenrightbigg\n, (34)\nwhere\u03bbAand\u03bbBare the transverse eigenvalues of the submatrices A(\u03b1\u03b2)(\u03b3\u03b4)andB(\u03b1\u03b2)(\u03b3\u03b4)\nrespectively. Calculation of these involves consideration of the sym metry properties of the\nsubmatrices, and is detailed in the Appendix. The eigenvalue equation s reduce to\n\u03bbA+c=\u03bb\n1 +c\u03bbB=c\u03bb (35)\nWe thus have the two replicon mode eigenvalues\n\u03bb\u00b1=1\n2(\u03bbA+\u03bbB)\u00b1/radicalBigg\n1\n4(\u03bbA\u2212\u03bbB)2+1 (36)\nFor stability, the product of the eigenvalues must be non-negative . A further subtlety\nis introduced here. \u03bb+can be seen to be >0 irrespective of \u03c32\n\u01ebora.\u03bb\u2212, on the other\n8\nhand, changes sign, moving from negative to positive for smaller \u03c32\n\u01eb. However, intuitively we\nexpect, from the analogy of the noise with the \u2018temperature\u2019 para meter in other models of\nneural networks [1] and physical systems [14] that if replica-symm etry breaking is to set in,\nit will do so at low noise variances. This is con\ufb01rmed by the eminently sen sible behaviour of\nthe mutual information curves of Fig. 1 at medium to high noise, but n onphysical behaviour\nat very low noise values. It can be concluded that, as occurs in [1,12], a sign reversal has\nbeen introduced due to the integration contour, which must be cor rected.\nThese equations have been numerically solved for \u03bb\u2212. Fig. 2 shows the behavior of \u03bb\u2212\nfor a range of sparsenesses and thresholds. Where the eigenvalu e passes above the zero axis\n(dottedline), a phaseofRS-instabilityisindicated. Fig.2aisforthes ituationofquitesparse\ncoding of the patterns. As the noise is reduced from the high noise r egion, in which the RS\nsolution is stable, the eigenvalue changes sign, and an unstable regio n is entered. In the case\nof threshold \u03be0= 0.4, which represents only a very small degree of threshold-like be havior,\nthe eigenvalue can be seen to curve back and change sign again at low er noise values still.\nDue to non-convergence of numerical integration, it is not possible to examine extremely\nsmall noise values; therefore it is not clear from this diagram whethe r the eigenvalue also\nfalls below zero again for the other curves plotted in this \ufb01gure, or if it instead has a \ufb01nite\nvalue at zero noise. However, any region of RS stability at noise varia nces this low would\nobviously be irrelevant for the same numerical reasons.\nIt is apparent from Figs. 2(b) and (c) that as the input distribution is made less sparse\n(ais increased), the critical amount of noise below which instability arise s increases. This\nwill be discussed again shortly. Another e\ufb00ect that can be seen in Fig s. 2(a) and (b) is that,\nas the neurons are made more linear ( \u03be0is increased), the critical noise \ufb01rst rises, then falls.\nThis becomes more clear after plotting a phase diagram of noise again st\u03be0(Fig. 3). For low\na(sparse distributions), the critical noise rises, falls, and then cur ves back around on itself\n\u2013 after the neurons become su\ufb03ciently linear, there is no more regio n of instability. As the\npattern code becomes less sparse, at \ufb01rst the region of instability merely expands. When a\nreaches a certain value, however, the edge of the unstable region no longer curls in on itself,\nbut extends outwards. At a sparseness of 0.5, for instance, the critical noise thus \ufb01rst rises\nwith increasing linearity, taking longer to reach its peak than for mor e sparse distributions,\nthen falls, and \ufb01nally levels o\ufb00 and decreases slowly. The sparseness at which this change in\nbehavior is exhibited is independent of the parameters of the syste m, and can be seen from\nFig. 3 to lie somewhere between 0.2 and 0.5.\nIn the special case of the linear limit, in which \u03be0\u2192 \u221e,\u03bbAdisappears (see Appendix),\nand stability is assured. For \ufb01nite \u03be0and above the coe\ufb03cient of sparseness referred to in\nthe previous paragraph, though, there is a distinct and reasonab ly large region of instability.\nThe resulting phase diagrams are shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 4(a) shows the situation for\n\u03be0=\u22120.4, which corresponds to threshold-linear behavior. As \u03be0is increased (Fig. 4b-\nd; the neurons are made progressively \u201cmore linear\u201d), the critical noise variance at which\ninstability of the RS solution sets in \ufb01rst increases, and then decrea ses, as would be expected\nfromFig. 3. In Fig. 4(d), the line of critical noise variance abruptly s tops ata\u223c0.23: at this\npoint, the replicon-mode eigenvalue passes below the zero axis, and stability is assured. In\nall cases, it is apparent that in particular for very sparse distribut ions, the replica-symmetric\nequationsarevaliddowntoquitelownoise. Forlesssparsecoding, wh erethepatternentropy\nis signi\ufb01cantly higher, the replica-symmetry-broken solution would s eem to be relevant for\n9\nhigher noise variances.\nIt should be noted that the sparseness of the distribution of outp uts is not the same as\nthat of the inputs.

(38)\nThe lines of marginal stability for \u03be0=\u22120.4,\u03be0= 0.0,\u03be0= 0.4 and\u03be0= 0.80 are replotted\nin Fig. 5 against the output sparseness. Although the phase diagra ms look fairly similar\nwhen plotted as a function of input sparseness, they occupy di\ufb00er ent regions of the output\nsparseness domain because of the thresholding. It is also worth no ting that because of the\nmapping performed by Eq. 37, the boundaries of the regions in Fig. 4 do not necessarily\nform the boundaries of the regions in the output-sparseness plan e, which in some instances\nconstitute points from inside the above curves.\nFor neurons operating in the threshold-linear regime (left curve, \u03be0<0.0), where output\nsparseness is e\ufb00ectively constrained by the thresholding, the sta bility characteristics are\nqualitatively as has been described earlier. For \u03be0= 0.0, it is apparent from Eqs. 37 and\n38 that the output sparseness is constant (regardless of the inp ut sparseness) at a value of\n1/\u03c0. As\u03be0is increased above zero, the output becomes less sparse, and the line of marginal\nstability is \ufb02ipped horizontally (because in this range the entropy is hig her for smaller\naout; right curves). Assuming that the sparseness of coding in connec ted sets of neurons in\nthe brain tends to be similar, the former curve (for threshold-linea r behaviour) might be\nconsidered the more biologically applicable, with the threshold in this mo del incorporating\nfunctionally the constraint on the degree of neural activity.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nThis paper has detailed the replica symmetric solution for the informa tion transmitted\nby a feedforward network of threshold-linear neurons, and exam ined its stability to \ufb02uc-\ntuations in the direction of replica symmetry breaking. It appears t hat for sparse pattern\ndistributions, replica-symmetry breaking only sets in at noise varian ces su\ufb03ciently small\nthat we might reasonably consider them to be \u2018beyond the realm of bio logical interest\u2019, at\nleast for noisy cortical cells. We believe that, quite importantly, the re is every reason to\nexpect that these results carry over to the slightly more complicat ed \u2018Scha\ufb00er collateral\u2019 cal-\nculation described in [8,9]. There is thus reason to feel con\ufb01dence in t he replica-symmetric\nassumption when analysing neural networks in areas such as the hip pocampus which are\nknown to code sparsely.\nWhen more distributed (less sparse) encoding is used, the mutual in formation solution\nis prone to instability to replica-symmetry-breaking \ufb02uctuations at higher amounts of noise\n10\nthan in the sparse case. It is not clear from the current analysis wh at the quantitative e\ufb00ect\nof broken replica symmetry might be, or what the form of the exact solution would be in\nthat case (e.g. the Parisi ansatz [15]). Care should therefore be t aken when analysing the\ninformation conveyed by networks using more distributed encoding .\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe would like to thank S Panzeri, F Battaglia and C Fulvi-Mari for usefu l discussions.\nIn particular, we would like to thank ET Rolls for his role in the collaborat ive research\nenvironment that allowed this work to be undertaken.

Bibliography \n \n \nIntroduction \n The study of networks pervades all of science, from neurobiology to statistical \nphysics\n1-6. As Strogatz states in his review article3, \u0093Empirical studies have shed light \non the topology of food webs, electrical pow er grids, cellular and metabolic networks, \nthe world-wide web, the internet backbone, the neural network of the nematode worm \nCaenorhabditis elegans, telephone call gra phs, coauthorship and citation networks of \nscientists, and the quintessential \u0091old-boy\u0092 network, the overlapping boards of \ndirectors of the largest companies in the United States. These databases are now easily \naccessible, courtesy of the internet. Moreove r the availability of powerful computers \nhas made it feasible to probe their struct ure; until recently, computations involving \nmillion-node networks would have been im possible without specialized facilities. \nWhy is network anatomy so important to characterize? Because structure always \naffects function!\u0094 \n The emerging network is more like a cell than a system of interlocking gears. The \ndiverse components, each performing a spec ialized job, compose a dynamic system. \n  \nA. Graph Theory\n1-2 \n \nA graph is a finite set of nodes and arcs, where relations between nodes are \nrepresented by arcs. There are many different types of graphs. In Process Network \nSynthesis (PNS), described in C below, we  use a unique bipartite graph called P-\ngraph. It can handle two different types of nodes, commonly the set of operating units and the set of materials if it is used in Process Network Synthesis. Operating units are \nrepresented by horizontal bars and materials by circles. Arcs can exist between \ndifferent types of nodes only. Direction of an arc represents the consumption or the \nproduction of a material by an operating unit,  so that if the material is consumed by \nthe operating unit, then the arc is directed to the operating unit, and if the material is \nproduced by the operating unit, the arc is directed to the material. \n \n \nB. Combinatorics \n Combinatorics is a branch of mathematics. It s function is to generate certain groups of \ngiven elements and to determine the possible number of such groups. The \nmathematical programming approach to Process Network Synthesis has two important steps: the generation of the mathematical model and the solution of the \nmodel. Both steps have combinatorial aspects. In the first step graph representation of \nthe mathematical model should be postulated, while in the second step the model to \nbe solved contains combinatorial variables. Combinatorial algorithms have been \ndeveloped to be able to solve even large scale industrial problems. Process Network Synthesis (PNS) is described below. \n 3C. Process-Network Synthesis, \n \nCombinatorial Problems in Chemical Engineering7-10 \n \nA number of papers by Friedler, Fan and their associates concern a major task in \nchemical engineering: the design of industria l plants. This is usually done by using a \nseries of flowsheets to plan the best possible connection of the process units in \nspecific ways that include the raw materials and products. \n \nUp until just recently, we have never been certain that the best flowsheet or plan for \nthe industrial plant or its revision, with constraints such as least cost, least maintenance, most profit, minimum pollution, etc., has been obtained. Now, however, \na method leading to such a desired result is existent. \n \nThe task has been to develop a problem formulation that manifests the unique \nstructure of the class of problems and a solution procedure that exploits the specific structure of the problem. The method requires an in-depth understanding of both the \nengineering and mathematical aspects of the problem. The algorithmic process \nsynthesis requires as given: a set of products , a set of raw materials, and mathematical \nmodels of the operating units. Then, the best processes or every feasible process with \noptimality criteria of cost, waste generation, control, risk, and combinations of these \nfactors can be generated. The rigorous technique is based on combinatorics. \n \nStructural representation uses process gra phs or P-graphs for unit operations in \nprocess synthesis. The axioms are: (S1) Every final product is represented in the \nstructure; (S2) A material represented in the structure is a raw material if and only if it \nis not an output of any operating unit represented in the structure; (S3) Every \noperating unit represented in the structure is defined in the synthesis problem; (S4) \nEvery operating unit defined in the structure has at least one path leading to a product; \nand (S5) If a material belongs to the structure,  it must be an input to or an output from \nat least one operating unit represented in the structure.  \nThe union of all combinatorially feasible structures is called the maximal structure. \nThe generation of this maximal structure requires, for its synthesis, a set of raw materials, a set of products and a set of operating units. The output is the maximal \nstructure which is the algorithmic generation of all solution-structures of the synthesis \nproblem. The method utilizes the accelerated Branch and Bound (ABB) algorithm for \nsolving PNS problems. It reduces the size of an individual subproblem through \nexclusion of those operating units that should not be included in any feasible solution \nof the problem. The method of generation of the optimal solution, by minimizing the \nnumber of subproblems to be solved, takes place with very great speed. \n \nFor 35 operating units, there are 34 billion subproblems. The five axioms reduce the \n34 billion combinations of the operating units to 3,465 combinatorially feasible structures. The optimal solution is included in the set of 3,465 feasible structures. The \nP-graph concept is also used in separation problems, which include distillation \ncolumns, mixers, etc. The solution of all these problems can now often be done on a \ndesk computer or PC in a couple of minutes. \n \n 4A major goal of this work is to point out that some of the similarities between process \nnetwork synthesis as applied to chemical engineering can be applied to biological \nnetworks and to suggest that some of the former techniques can lead to significant \nresults in the study of biological networks. Also, some of the results of the physics of \nnetwork theory and its applications to biol ogical networks can be applied to chemical \nengineering flow sheets.  \n D. Biological Networks  \n Life is expressed as the interactions am ong different proteins and molecules. These \nform the cell but are not considered to be alive in themselves. Genetic networks \nmodeled from the genes may include RNA, proteins and regulatory DNA sequences \nof nucleotides composing each gene. Such primary sequences are now known at an \nincreasing rate. It is difficult to link the genes and their products with functional \npathways and networks. Regulatory networks are functions of combinatorial matters that are very complex but details are emerging. The inputs and outputs of each node \nare becoming known, although their elucidation may be complex. \n \n D1. Exploration of Biological Networks through Analogy with Process Networks \n \nIt is highly likely that the graph-theoreti c method of synthesizing process networks \noutlined earlier can be adopted for exploring the generation and functioning of biological networks in the light of vari ous analogies between these two classes of \nnetworks. Such analogies are self-evide nt: Every biological species comprises \nmolecules and thus is a chemical species in forming a biological network. It is worth \nrecalling that the graph-theoretic method of PNS (process-network synthesis) is based \non P-graphs consisting of two types of ver tices (nodes); one devoted by circles is for \nchemical species, and the other denoted by horizontal bars is for functional units, \ntermed operating units, performing transfor mations. The arcs linking these two types \nof vertices signify the direction of the tr ansformations. To aid the identification of \nanalogies, we will describe programs later,  to describe, document and solve for results \nand extents of pathways among species. This will break up the networks into steps that can be synthesized later to produce the network. We will also use a theoretical \nconstruction that aids in the analysis of steps or links in the networks that indicate \nwhich are the fundamental ones in the netw ork or global process. Cellular functions \ncan also be described as \u0093modules\u0094 made up of many species of interacting \nmolecules. Functional modules are biological  pathways: collections of molecules, \nboth large and small, that cooperate to perform a given function, such as protein \nsynthesis, signal transduction, or the biosynthesis of small molecules. \n \n D2. Genetic Networks \n \nThe dynamics of genetic networks rest  upon time dependent connections. \u0093Random \nBoolean networks\u0094 and global dynamics, which are organized into basins of attraction \nassociated with them. Stability and adaptability that respond to perturbation are \nbalanced and form an essential part of  the design. Computer simulations and \nstatistical mechanics are now modeling genetic structure. There is a robust nature to \n 5these systems and their genetic properties. The genetic regulatory system is a very \nlarge directed network. The components are the vertices and the edges proceed from \nthe regulating to the regulated component \n \n D3. Protein Networks\n11-16 \n \n\u0093Lethality and centrality in protein networks17-19 \n \nAn article by Jeong, et al.18, states, \u0093Cell biology traditionally identifies proteins \nbased on their individual actions as catalyst s, signaling molecules, or building blocks \nof cells and microorganisms. Currently, we witness the emergence of a post-genomic \nview that expands the protein\u0092 role, regardi ng it as an element in a network of protein-\nprotein interactions as well, with a \u0091contextu al\u0092 or \u0091cellular\u0092 function within functional \nmodules. Here we provide quantitative support for this paradigm shift by \ndemonstrating that the phenotypic consequence of a single gene deletion in the yeast, S. cerevisiae, is affected, to a high degr ee, by the topologic position of its protein \nproduct in the complex, hierarchical web of molecular interactions. \n \nThe S. cerevisiae protein-protein intera ction network we investigate has 1,870 \nproteins as nodes, connected by 2,240 iden tified direct physical interactions, and is \nderived from combined, non-overlapping data  obtained mostly by systematic two-\nhybrid analyses. Due to its size, a complete  map of the network, while informative in \nitself offers little insight into its large-scal e characteristics. Thus, our first goal was to \nidentify the architecture of this network, determining if it is best described by an \ninherently uniform exponential topology with proteins on average possessing the \nsame number of links, or by a highly hete rogeneous scale-free topology with proteins \nhaving widely different connectivities. The probability that a given yeast protein \ninteracts with k other yeast proteins follows a power-law form. (This topology is also \nshared by the protein-protein interaction netw ork of the bacterium, H. pylori). It has \nan approximate value of the degree distributi on of ~2.5, with an exponential cutoff at \nk\nc\u224520. This indicates that the network of protein interactions in two separate \norganisms forms a highly inhomogeneous scale- free network in which a few highly \nconnected proteins play a central role in mediating interactions among numerous, less \nconnected proteins.\u0094 \n \nAn important known consequence of the inhomogeneous structure in the network \u00eds \nsimultaneous tolerance against random errors coupled with fragility against the \nremoval of the most connected nodes. Indeed, we find that random mutations in the genome of S. cerevisiae, modeled by the re moval of randomly selected yeast proteins, \ndo not affect the overall topology of the network. In contrast, when the most \nconnected proteins are computationally eliminated, the network diameter increases \nrapidly. \n The simultaneous emergence of an inhomogeneous structure in both metabolic and \nprotein interaction networks indicates the evolutionary selection of a common large \nscale structure of biological networks, and strongly suggests that future systematic \nprotein-protein interaction studies in othe r organisms will uncover an essentially \nidentical protein network topology. The correlation between the connectivity and indispensability of a given protein confirms that despite the importance of individual \n 6biochemical function and genetic redundanc y, the robustness against mutations in \nyeast is also derived from the organization of interactions and topologic position of \nindividual proteins. Thus, a better understanding of cell dynamics and robustness will \nbe obtained from integrated approaches that simultaneously incorporate the individual \nand contextual properties of all cons tituents of complex cellular networks. \n Many drugs target single abnormal proteins. But proteins form networks, almost like a \ncircuit board, that directs different cells . Those patterns can fluctuate minute-to-\nminute, depending on what medications or other compounds affect the proteins. And \nwith cancer, a drug targeting just one prot ein may help some patients--but other times \ntumors just reroute themselves along the protein network to evade treatment. Because everything is hooked up in circuits, it gives cancer cells the advantage, a fantastic \nadvantage. \n \n D4. Metabolic networks\n22-24 \n \nBiochemical reaction networks and their information pathways are known for 43 \norganisms. They are similar, robust, s cale-free and error tolerant. Perhaps this \nprecludes an inherent cellular life patter n. Metabolic reaction networks are rich \ntopological designs. The vertices are desi gnated as either substrates or molecular \ncompounds. Their edges are designated as the metabolic reacti ons. They can be \nproducts of incoming edges (reactions) or educts of outgoing edges (reactions). The \nsymbols ki or k0 (number of incoming edges or outgoing edges) have an average path \nlength of 3 and values of about 2.5 to 4.  The degree is scale-free and obeys a power \nlaw with exponent about 2.2. The clustering coefficient is defined as the probability \nthat the two nearest neighbors of  a vertex are also nearest neighbors of each other. It \nis about 0.3 (much larger than the random coefficient) for Escherichia Coli and this \norganism has 282 nodes. Thus the neighborhood of the network vertex is a \u0093clique\u0094. \nA graph-theoretical identification of pathways  for biochemical reactions is referred to \nin section E7.  \n D5. Kauffman\n23 \n \nErdos and Renyi, 1959, showed, \u0093a s the ratio of edge to nodes, E/N increases past 0.5, \nthe size of the largest component jumps from very small to a giant component \ncontaining most of the nodes in the system. This is a first order phase transition. \nIntuitively, when the ratio of edges to nodes is small, only isolated nodes and small dyads or trees will exist. As more edges are randomly added, the small components \nwill slowly grow larger. But when these become fairly large, a few more randomly \nadded edges will connect these modest components into the giant component. Indeed, \nthe phase transition occurs just when the ratio of the ends of edges equals the number \nof nodes\u0094.  \nWaldrop relates in his book\n23a about Kauffman\u0092s work, \u0093any cell in an organism \ncontains a number of regulatory genes that act as switches and can turn one another \non and off. If genes can turn one another on a nd off, then you have genetic circuits.\u0094 \nHe further surmised that the genome as a whole could be simulated in such circuits \n 7and that the circuits could settle down into a stable, self-consistent pattern of active \ngenes. \n \nNow, the precise genetic details of any given organism would be a product of random \nmutations and natural selection, but the organi zation of life itself, the order, would be \ndeeper and more fundamental. It would arise purely from the structure of the network, not the details. \n \nAs Kauffman states, \u0093The genetic circuits you find in real cells have been refined by \nmillions of years of evolution.\u0094 Kauffman  \u0093shuffled the deck\u0094 and dealt out a bunch \nof utterly typical genetic circuits to see if they did produce stable configurations. \n \nRegulatory genes were essentially just switches which flip back and forth between \ntwo states: active or inactive, similar to light bulbs (on-off) or as a statement in logic \n(true-false). These genetic light bulbs organize themselves into interesting patterns. \nThe connections were to be sparse but no t too sparse. Two-input networks always \nseemed to stabilize very quickly. He simulated a network with 100 genes. The \nnetwork quickly settled into orderly states, with most of the genes frozen on or off and \nthe rest cycling through a ha ndful of configurations. \n \nKauffman \u0093could tell that a system is at the critical state and/or the edge of chaos if it \nshows waves of change and upheaval on all scales and if the size of the changes \nfollows a power law. One can expect any closely interacting population of agents to \nget themselves into a state of self-organized criticality, with avalanches of change that follows a power law.\u0094 He performed this with a computer program that simulated a \ntwo-input network with 100 genes in it. This network quickly settled down into \norderly states, with most of the genes frozen on or off and the rest cycling through a \nhandful of configurations. \n \nKauffman's work seems to accentuate that the edge of chaos in such a system is very \nimportant in biological processes and that much activity proceeds from this state. Below is another description of what is ca lled critical states, borrowed from physics, \nthat also demonstrates how such processes can take place. \n  \nD6. Critical Properties\n24 \n \nA method for deriving the chemical potential of particles adsorbed on a two \ndimensional surface has previously been derived for lateral and next nearest neighbor interactions of the particles. In order to do so a parameter called K was used and \nK=((exp((\u00b5- \u03b5)/kT)) (\u03b8/1-\u03b8))\n1/Z. It was found from a series of normalizing, consistency \nand equilibrium relations shown in papers by Hijmans and DeBoer (1) and used by \nBumble and Honig (2) in a paper on the adsorption of a gas on a solid. In the above, \u00b5 \nis the chemical potential and \u03b5 is the adsorption energy. The numerical values of K \nwere derived from computers for various la ttices with different values of the \ninteraction parameters for nearest neighbors ( c), where c=exp(- w/kT), w is the \ninteraction energy, Z is the coordination number with occupancy ( \u03b8), the lattice \noccupation stands for the fraction of sites covered. \n \n 8The value of K given above has the chemical potential in it and solving for this \nquantity we obtain KZ (\u03b8/1 - \u03b8) where Z is the coordination number of cells in a tissue \napproximated as a lattice. \n \nThe lattice has been approximated as triangular and was broken up into basic figures \nmentioned above. The larger the basic figure the more complicated the algebra. The bond yields K=(\u03b2\u00961+2 \u03b8)/(2\u03b8c), where \u03b2=[1+4 c\u03b8 (1-\u03b8) (c-1)] and the triangle as basic \nfigure yields a quartic equation K\n4 - a1 K3 + a2 K2 - a3 K + a4 =0 where a1=((2-5 \u03b8) \nc+2-3 \u03b8)/c(1-2), a2 = (c+5)/c, a3 = ((3-5 \u03b8)c+1-3 \u03b8)/c(1-2\u03b8) and a4=1/c2. Every point \nthen derived for the triangle basic figure subfigure is then found for the solution of the \nabove quartic equation for given values of c and \u03b8. \n \nIn previous applications of the above to gas adsorption, the value of Z was fixed. \nHowever, here, in general network applications, Z will vary. Thus, we vary Z and find \nthe value of c (c=exp(- w/RT) when the isotherm just begins to be flat or parallel to the \nabscissa theta ( \u03b8). When we do this we find that for the critical isotherms: \n \nc Z \n2.3 4 \n1.72 6 \n1.33 12 1.22 18 \n1.17 24 \n1.13 30 1.11 36 \n \nNow when we plot c versus Z on log-log graph paper we obtain a straight line. This \nmeans the graph has scaling, which we will discuss later. Now Z=4 is a two \ndimensional square lattice, Z=6 is a two dimensional triangular lattice and Z=12 to 36 \ncorresponds to a three dimensional sphere in which the central particle is in a plane \nsurrounded by up to 36 particles in six slices or planes of six particles each in a hexagonal pattern; all particles of each plane are connected to the central particle (or \ninteracts with the central part icle). This occurs in thre e dimensions and furthermore \nthe shell of surrounding particles in each plane are connected to each other, so that we \ncan apply the triangular approximation discussed above, as well as the bond \napproximation to obtain the solutions. \n \nThis critical state corresponds to the stat e where the chemical potential remains \nconstant. In this state (the grand canonical ensemble) particles will neither leave nor enter but reorder themselves or, in other terms, enter into the edge of chaos, which is a \nregime between order and disorder.  \n \nSanchez, et al., state, \u0093An investigation of the effect of directed links on the behavior \nof a simple spin-like model evolving on a small-world network was made. It showed that directed networks may lead to a highl y nontrivial phase diagram including first \nand second-order phase transitions out of equilibrium.\u0094\n25 \n \nNewman, et al., relate, \u0093A study of the theory of random graphs is shown with \narbitrary distributions of vertex degree, in cluding directed and bipartite graphs. Using \nthe mathematics of generating functions, one can calculate exactly many of the \n 9statistical properties of such graphs in the limit of large numbers of vertices. Explicit \nformulas for the position of the phase transition at which a giant component forms, \nthe size of the giant component, the average and distribution of the other components, \nthe average number of vertices a certain distance from a given vertex, the clustering \ncoefficient and the typical vertex-vertex distance on a graph all are shown.\u009426 \n 6a. Complexity.  The Fall, 1999, Santa Fe Bulletin\n27 has the following statements, \n\u0093studying intermediate kinds of networks  between lattice-like networks and random \nnetworks led Watts and Strogatz27-28 to the discovery that when just a few long-range, \nrandom connections replace the local edges of a lattice-like network, the characteristic \npath length decreases dramatically; and a \u0093shortcut\u0094 occurs. And while the first random rewiring has a great impact on path length, the clustering changes very little. \nEven when the separation of elements in a network is very small the clustering can \nremain almost as high as possible. The result is what Watts and Strogatz call a \u0093small-\nworld network.\u0094 The name derives from the fact that it exhibits the short global \nseparations that are typified (anecdotally) by social interactions while maintaining the high degree of clustering exhibited in most social networks. The neural network of the \nnematode worm C. elegans is the sole example of a completely mapped neural \nnetwork and turns out to be a small-world network.\u0094 \n \n \nD7. Scaling \n Many large networks are scale-free (SF); their degree distribution follows a power-law for large k, i.e., (nodes that have many connections). SF networks come about \nbecause they model network assembly and evolution. When we capture correctly the \nprocesses that assembled the networks, then we will obtain the topology as well. Most \nreal networks exhibit preferential attach ment. Growth and preferential attachment \ncaused the introduction of the SF model that has a power-law degree distribution. \n \n7a. Small World . As big as it is, this is a \u0093small world\u0094. The \u0093small world\u0094 of social \nnetworks is known as \u0093six degrees of separa tion\u0094. Small clusters of social networks \neach node connected to the world outside their own circle of friends with a few weak \nlinks. The 800 million documents (or nodes) of the web (up to 1999) has a shortest path of only 19 links. \n \nAccording to Kim, et al.\n29, \u0093the possibility of the small-world phenomenon in scale-\nfree networks subjected to several local stra tegies of path finding was found. A very \nsimple local strategy based on local connectivity information leads to the scaling behavior D~log\n10N. The error tolerance and the attack vulnerability found previously \nby global strategy have been shown to be generic topological pr operties of scale-free \nnetworks, and do not depend on the path finding strategy.\u0094 \n  \nD8. Evolution  \nThe Time Machine \n The Graph Theoretic Process Synthesis Progr am, described in part C above, functions \nas a time machine. It propels the very intelligent engineer towards the far distant best \n 10design which he could have arrived at, had he practically infinite time. Thus it is in \nnature. A systematic comparative mathemati cal analysis of the metabolic and protein \nnetworks of 43 organisms representing all domains of life have the same organization \nof robust and error-tolerant scale-free netw orks representing a common blueprint for \nlarge-scale organizations of all cellular constituents. \n Originally it was thought that complex networks were modeled using the random \nnetwork theory introduced by Erdos and Re nyi, where each pair of nodes in the \nnetwork is randomly connected, leading to a network where most nodes have the \nsame number of links. Thus the probability  of finding a highly connected node decays \nexponentially (p( k) is equivalent to e\n-k) for k>>{k}. However it has been found that \nthe World-Wide Web, the internet and social network systems are described by a few \nhighly connected nodes which link the rest of the less connected nodes to the system \n(p(k) is equivalent to k-\u03b3). Now it has been found that this is also true for the biological \nnetworks referred to above. \n This must be so because they adhere to Darwin\u0092s theory of evolution. After many \nmillenniums the organisms have been adapting to their environment and the survival \nof the fittest has led to the structure of their metabolic and protein networks that are \nmost fit and are most robust and error-tolerant scale-free networks. \n The graph theoretic process synthesis flowsheet results may be of that nature, i.e., if \none tried to fit the log p( k) versus the log k, the curve would be linear and it would not \nfollow a Poisson distribution that peaks sharply at { k} and decays exponentially from \nthe value of { k}. \n \nIt is to be observed that the word \u0093optimum\u0094 was not used. In the biological sense the \nsystems have not found the optimum. They have only found the best fit to the \nenvironment. In the process synthesis sense, likewise, the optimum is not really \nfound, only the best fit to the constraints, be they cost minimized or profit maximized. \nIn the nature case, for the adaptation of the network system to the environment, the \nmethod is not the most efficient, but proceeds by trial and error, and after a suitable \ntime period, to find the best fit. Therefore in genetic and protein networks, we must \nattempt to simulate, rather than optimize, the networks of organisms with computer programs. \n \nAn article by Podani, et al.\n30, relates, \u0093the comparison of information transfer \npathways demonstrates a cl ose relationship of Archaea and Eukarya. Similarly, \nalthough eukaryotic metabolic enzymes have been shown being primarily of bacterial origin, the pathway-level organization of ar chaeal and eukaryotic metabolic networks \nalso proves more closely related. Our analyses therefore reveal a similar systemic \norganization of Archaea and Eukarya, and suggest that during symbiotic origin of \neukaryotes the incorporation of bacterial metabolic enzymes into the proto-archaeal \nproteome was constrained by the host\u0092s preexistent metabolic architecture. The large-scale metabolic organization is essentially identical in all contemporary species, all \npossessing a robust and error tolerant scal e-free network architecture. The complete \nmetabolic network is under organizational c onstraints. A selective pressure during the \nsymbiotic evolution of eukaryotes must have been present that limited their \nincorporation of bacterial metabolic enzymes,  in order to maintain the already existing \n 11near optimal metabolic network architect ure inherited from the proto-archaean \nhost.\u009430 \n \nIpsen, et al.31, state, \u0093an evolutionary algorithm for reconstruction of graphs from their \nLaplacian spectra is presented Through a stochastic process of mutations and \nselection, evolving test networks converge to a reference graph. The method allows exact reconstruction of relatively small networks and yields good approximations in \nthe case of large sizes for random and clus tered graphs and small-world networks. \nThis is a learning process where a test netw ork, by adjusting its internal structure, \nlearns to approximate dynamics generated by a different system. Approximations of \nlarge clustered graphs by graphs of smaller size can be constructed and networks that \ngenerate stochastic signals with power spectra can be designed.\u0094\n31 \n \nCancho, et al.32, state, \u0093when dealing with biological networks, the interplay between \nemergent properties derived from network gr owth and selection pressures has to be \ntaken into account. As an example, metabolic networks seem to result from an evolutionary history in which both prefer ential attachment and optimization are \npresent. The topology displayed by meta bolic networks is scale-free, and the \nevolutionary history of these nets suggests that preferential attachment might have \nbeen involved. Early in the evolution of life, metabolic nets grew by adding new \nmetabolites, and the most connected are known to be the oldest ones. On the other hand, several studies have revealed that metabolic pathways have been optimized \nthrough evolution in a number of ways. This suggests that the resulting networks are \nthe outcome of both contributions, plus some additional constraints imposed by the available components to the evolving network. In this sense, selective pressures might \nwork by tuning underlying rules of net construction. This view corresponds to \nKauffman\u0092s suggestion that evolution would operate by taking advantage of some \nrobust, generic mechanisms of structure formation.\u0094\n32 \n \n D9. Perturbation of Genetic and Protein Critical Networks  \n \nA method is suggested to design new drugs and counteract diseas e that builds upon \nthe combinatorial method now existent at dr ug companies, yet incorporates the matter \nintroduced in this paper on protein networks . To introduce this method, let us first \nreview the combinatorial method now existent. \n \nMethod Now Used\n33 \n \nWe wish to inhibit an enzyme (BAD) that causes certain cells to physically react, so \nthat a bad health effect occurs in the body. We will call a drug that inhibits this action \nBAD-1. A search is then conducted in the huge public genome database for snippets \nof DNA that resemble the known BAD enzyme. From this search, 10,000 computer \nmatches are obtained, each of them gene fragments representing potential BAD inhibitors. Let us suppose this snippet is TGCAATG. Then the library of several \nmillion frozen DNA fragments is explored and those that correspond to these \ncomputer matches are placed in tiny wells on plastic plates and fed to a robot machine \ncalled Zeus. Zeus dips tiny needles into the wells, picks up microscopic droplets of \nDNA and drops them onto a sheet of nylon paper, creating a so-called microarray. These sheets are rolled up and slipped into test tubes. The test tubes are then washed \n 12with genetic material from a wide range of tissue cells that have been labeled with a \nradioactive dye. When a gene is active in a particular cell type, the spot lights up \nunder UV. By comparing patterns of brightness, the researchers isolate one gene, \nwhich they call BAD-2 that looks promising. Confirming that BAD- 2 does indeed \nconvert the enzyme, the researchers look for a chemical that will inhibit BAD-2. They \nhave a head start because they know what BAD inhibitors look like. In their library of molecules they find one that works against BAD-2. This is their drug candidate. \nHowever, although the drug companies formerly thought this method was their sine \nqua non  for finding drug candidates, they now are looking for better methods to find \nlead compound drugs. \n \nExtension of the Method Now Used \n It is proposed that an extension to the method now used be extended by changing the \nword DNA referred to above to the word protein. The snippet will now be changed to, \ne.g., a sequence of amino acids that is a fra gment of the protein that is sought. This \ncould be AGPWLVM. This method is then analogous to the method above except that \nwe are now dealing with Prot eomics instead of DNA. There are many more proteins \nand sequences of amino acids possible than there are genes or sequences of \nnucleotides, so that much work would remain to be done in building up the library \nnecessary for this method, but such work is proceeding.  \nA New Method \n \nA new method is herein proposed that ut ilizes critical network theory described \nabove. Since complex systems are constructed so that they are on the boundary \nbetween order and chaos, these are the systems best able to adapt by mutation and \nselection. In this method a candidate or LEAD NETWORK is found from the network \nthat best satisfies the following constraints: \n \nThe vertices (or proteins) each have a combined coordination number and interaction energy that best satisfy the conditions for cr iticality established in D6, have physical \nproperties that correspond with results (as i ndicated by Synprops with the best data), \ncompare closely with the distribution of amino acids from experimental results (as indicated also by Knapsack and Synprops) and agree with QSARs (quantitative \nstructure activity relationships). Furthermore, the adjacency matrix is composed of \nelements that will meet the constraints above as closely as possible, the local aspects \nof the network can be extended to the global aspect and finally matrix equations \ncombining all of these constraints can be solved for their component elements as was done as a byproduct result of the Synprops method.\n35 \n \nThe LEAD NETWORKS will then not only be instrumental in finding the root of the \ndisease but also in fighting the disease itself. \n \n9a. Correction of Protein Network Models with Protein Folding Phenomena.  \nKramers published his \u0093pearl necklace model\u0094 of polymer molecules over 50 years ago (J. Chem. Phys., 14, 415, 1946). This can be used to find the angles between the \nlinks of a polymer, each link of a different mass and as a function of kinetic and \npotential energy, using statistical physics.  Since it has been shown that once the \nconfiguration of three particular links in the protein chain are ascertained, the whole \n 13polymer configuration can be found, then the corrections for the approximation of \nconsidering the protein as a point rather th at the valid folded functional polymer can \nbe made. It is also possible to do so because the polymer configuration can be put into \nits particular set of evolutionary forms that the protein will assume. Then the vertices \nof the network can be more realistically por trayed and the interactions between them \ncan be arrived at with greater precision and accuracy.  \n D10. Network Reconstruction and Reverse Engineering \n \n\u0093Models of Genetic Networks \n \nIn the preceding three decades, theoretica l models of genetic regulatory networks \nhave been studied intensively. Since only sparse data on eukaryotic gene regulation \nwere available, most studies were based on highly idealized models such as networks \nwith random links connecting the nodes and randomly chosen Boolean rules. With the arrival of high-throughput technologies the focus has recently shifted towards more \nrealistic models. The reconstruction of genetic networks from time resolved \nmeasurements of these gene expression matrices belongs to the class of inverse \nproblems and is given the name of reverse engineering. \n Each of the vertices of biological networ ks, whether it is a protein network or a \nmetabolic network, may represent a chemical  species and thus has physical properties. \nMethods that convert structure to properties are described below. Methods are also described that convert properties and hence the structure or vertices to an optimum or \nconstrained values.\u0094 \n \n E1. Synprops\n34 \n Cramer\u0092s data was portrayed in a table of group properties. Results so obtained were \nfrom extensive regressions on experimental  data from handbooks and were tested and \nstatistically analyzed. The data was used to predict physical properties for other \ncompounds than those used to derive the data. Optimization procedures were combined with the Cramer data (in an extended spreadsheet), and applied for \nPollution Prevention and Process Optimizati on. In addition, Risk Based Concentration \nTables, etc., were included as constraints to insure that the resulting composite \nstructures were environmentally benign. \n During the course of many years, scientists  have recognized the relationship between \nchemical structure and activity. Pioneering work had been done by Hammett in the \n1930s, Taft in the 1950s and Hansch in the 1960s. Brown also recognized the relation \nbetween steric effects and both properties and reactions. QSAR methodologies were \ndeveloped and used in the areas of drug, pesticide and herbicide research. In the 1970s, spurred by the increasing number of chemicals being released to the \nenvironment, QSAR methods began to multiply. \n \n \n  \n 14E2. Physical Properties form Groups \n \nIt has also been known that a wide range of properties can be derived using The \nPrinciple of Corresponding States which us ed polynomial equations expressed with \nreduced temperature and pressure. In order to  obtain the critical properties needed for \nthe reduced temperature and reduced pressure, the critical constants are derived from the parameters for the groups of which the molecules are composed. \n \nThus, the treatment of many molecule s through their composite groups and the \nconnection with their properties becomes an exercise of obtaining good data to work \nwith. This is particularly difficult for drug and ecological properties that are not in the public domain. \n \nCramer\u0092s method consisted of applying re gressions to data from handbooks, such as \nthe Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, etc., to fit the physical properties of \nmolecules with the groups comprising their structures. The results considered about 35 groups and were used in the Linear-Constitutive Model and a similar number of \ngroups (but of a different nature) were used  in the Hierarchical Additive-Constitutive \nModel. Statistically a g ood fit was found and the prediction capabilities for new \ncompounds were found to be excellent. \n Twenty-one physical properties were fitted to the structures. The Properties (together \nwith their dimensions) were Log activity coefficient and Log partition coefficient \n(both dimensionless), Molar refractivity (cm\n3/mol), Boiling point (degrees C.), Molar \nvolume (cm3/mol), Heat of vaporization (kcal/mol), Magnetic susceptibility (cgs \nmolar), Critical temperature (degrees C.), Van der Waals A1/2 (L atm1/2/mol), Van der \nWaals B (L/mol), Log dielectric constant (dimensionless), Solubility parameter \n(cal/cm3), Critical pressure (atm), Surface tension (dynes/cm), Thermal Conductivity \n(104x(cals-1cm-2(cal/cm)-1), Log viscosity (dimensionless), Isothermal (m2/molx1010), \nDipole moment (Debye units), Melting point (degrees C.) and Molecular weight \n(g/mol). Later the equations for molar vol ume (Bondi scheme) and molar refractivity \n(Vogel scheme) were included as were also equations for the Log Concentration \nX/Water, where X was ether, cyclohexane, chloroform, oils, benzene and ethyl \nalcohol, resp., Risk-Based Concentrations a nd Biological Activity equations were also \nincluded. \n \nThe formulas for physical properties, activities or Risk Based Concentrations is the \ngeneral linear combination equation  \n \nPij = ai+biBj+ciCj+diDj+eiEj+fiFj \n \nThe i subscripts stand for different properties and the j subscripts indicate different \nmolecules. It may be seen that the spreadsheets are like the blueprints of a molecule \nwhose structure is the composite of the nu mbers in one column and whose properties \nare given in another column. The quantities B...F are analogous to the genes (5 in this \ncase) in living systems.  \nThe hardware and software for personal computers have developed very rapidly. Thus \nthe treatment of many molecules through their composite groups and the connection \n 15with their properties became an exercise of  obtaining good data to work with. In the \nPC spread sheet \u0093Tools\u0094 part of the program is an Optimizer program, which was \nused in this work. The technology of the modern PC was matched with the power of \nmathematics to obtain results. Thus the stru cture of molecules could be constrained by \ntheir physical properties or molecules could be designed with the best physical \nproperties of concern.35 \n \nThe physical properties of the links in the protein molecule were assessed from the \nSynprops program. The following eight propertie s were of particular interest: dipole \nmoment, volume, hydrophobicity, log of the activity coefficient, log of the partition \ncoefficient, solubility parameter, chi, and molar refractivity. In the literature, it is stated that the hydrophobicity is most important. Contrary to this it has been surmised \nthrough the comparison from results from the Synprops program, the Knapsack \nprogram and comparison of the literature  values for the frequencies of amino acid \nresidues of the genomes of living organisms,  Archaea, Bacteria, Eukaryotes, etc., that \nthe importance of the properties rank as fo llows: log of the partition coefficient, \nhydrophobicity, volume, dipole moment. It is also important to note that many times \nthese physical properties are functions of each other. In fact the log of the partition \ncoefficient can be derived very closely as the function of two other properties. A false \nroute that can be taken is the tracing of the relation of the properties to the evolution \nof organisms. This is because many orga nisms are not developed from others but can \nbe branches of the same evolutionary hierarchical routes. \n \n \nE3. Design of Molecules with Desired Properties by Combinatorial Analysis\n36 \n \nFriedler and Fan and their associates furt her published work that stated: \u0093Suppose that \na set of groups to be considered and the intervals of values of the desired properties of \nthe molecule to be designed are given. Then, the desired properties constitute \nconstraints on the integer variables assigned to the groups. The feasible region defined \nby these constraints is determined by an algorithm involving a branching strategy. The algorithm generates those collections of the groups that can constitute structurally \nfeasible molecules satisfying the constraints on the given properties. The molecular \nstructures can be generated for any collection of the functional groups.  \nThe proposed combinatorial approach consider s only the feasible partial problems and \nsolutions in the procedure, thereby resulting in a substantial reduction in search space. \nAvailable methods exist in two classes. One composes structures exhaustively, \nrandomly or heuristically, by resorting to ex pert systems, from a given set of groups; \nthe resultant molecule is examined to determine if it is endowed with the specified \nproperties. This \u0093generate-and-test\u0094 strategy is usually capable of taking into account \nonly a small subset of feasible molecular structures of the compound of interest. It \nyields promising results in some applications, but the chance of reaching the target \nstructure by this strategy can be small for any complex problem, e.g., that involving a large number of groups. In the second class, a mathematical programming method is \napplied to a problem in which the objective function expresses the \u0093distance\u0094 to the \ntarget. The results of this assessment may be precarious since the method for \nestimating the properties of the structure generated, e.g., group contributions, is not \nsufficiently precise. The work here is a combinatorial approach for generating all \nfeasible molecular structures, determin ed by group contributions, in the given \n 16intervals. The final selection of the best structure or structures is to be performed by \nfurther analysis of these candidate structures with available techniques.\u0094 \n \n \nE4. THERM37 \n \nA set of subprograms collectively called THERM written by Ritter and Bozelli37 have \nproven very useful in programs for equilibrium such as the minimum free energy \nprogram and those for chemical kinetics. THERM supplies the thermochemical data \nneeded by these two programs based on  the data files in Benson\u0092s book \nThermochemical Kinetics.38 The data in THERM is given for 330 groups. They are \ndivided into 3 types of groups, BD-bond dissociation groups, CDOT-radical groups \nand Regular groups-all other groups with  no unbonded electrons. The last groups \nconsist of HC-hydrocarbon groups, CYCH-ring corrections for hydrocarbon, oxygen, \nand nitrogen containing ring systems, INT-interaction groups/substituent effects, \nCLC-chlorine and halogen containing groups, HCO-oxygen containing groups and HCN-nitrogen containing groups. Recipes guide the user into the various \nsubprograms. ENTER/ESTMATE SPECIES asks fo r species ID, number of groups in \nthe species, number of different groups to be entered, elemental formula, groups \ncontained in the species and the species symmetry number. (The code for the groups \nin the species takes a while to get used to). The result when stored in Therm.lst  is in \nthe form heat of formation, entropy and heat capacity at 300, 400, 500, 800, 1000, and \n1500 degrees Kelvin. The whole Therm.lst  file for many species can be converted to \nthe Therm.dat  file, which is exactly what is needed in the NASA format for LSENS \nand Chemkin programs. This is done with amazing speed by the subprogram \nThermfit . Incidentally, literature values for H, S and Cp can be converted to the \nNASA format with Thermfit  as well. The Therm.dat  file is also needed in Thermrxn  \nwhich is a sub program where a chemist writes a reaction which is immediately \nconverted to a table of enthalpies entropies free energies, equilibrium constants, ratio \nof Arrhenius factors at a series of temperat ures and in units of one\u0092s option. All the \ninformation found by THERM can be sorted and stored in specific files easily recalled. \n \nA protein is described by the series of am ino acid residues attached to its backbone. A \nmethod of determining the frequency of occurrence of the remnants of these amino \nacids in a given protein is described below. A combinatorial method such as that \ndescribed in E5 may then be used to correlate such frequencies of the constituents of \nthe proteins of various organisms to their evolution. \n  \nE5. The Knapsack Problem \n \nIt would be interesting to use physical pr operties to study the folding of proteins \nwhich leads to their function. Accordingly, it was thought that the properties of volume and hydrophobicity would be of use in that hydrophobicity is preferred in the \nfolding and also the extended version of the polymer configuration changes to a \nglobular packed version before its function can be realized as a target for docking. \nThe question then arises as to how many ways can one pack a fixed container with \nproperty values without exceeding, but fully utilizing, the space that is preordained for the container. \n 17It then occurred that the knapsack methodology of discrete mathematics could be \nused. The knapsack problem for solutions aris es when a single critical resource is to \nbe optimally allocated among a variety of options. Specifically, a number of items are \navailable, each of which consumes a known resource and contributes a known benefit. \nItems are to be selected to maximize the total benefit without exceeding the given \namount of the resource. If N={1, 2,\u0085, n) is a given set of n items and j consumes \n(requires) aj>0 units of the resource and confers the benefit cj>0, we have the \nknapsack problem as the following 0-1 integer linear programming problem: \n \nmaximize: \u03a3j\u2208N cjxj \nsubject to: \u03a3j\u2208N ajxj is smaller than or equal to b \nx \u2208 {0,1} \nwhere aj is smaller or equal to b for all j \u2208 N. \n \nThus proteins could be designed for freque ncies of amino acid residues that imbues \nthe protein with the best desired physical properties or the structure that conforms most to the properties desired. Indeed, this can be carried out for all the properties, not \nonly hydrophobicity or volume. The values of hydrophobicity and volume were \nobtained from Synprops (as were some 30 other properties) but only six other chosen \nproperties were singled out for special attention: dipole moment, log partition \ncoefficient, log activity coefficient, chi, molar refractivity and solubility parameter for fifteen amino acid residue links of the poly peptide. The eight were reduced to seven \nbecause the molar solubility parameter and the log activity coefficients were found to \nbe functions of each other. Later the vol umes and hydrophobicity were found in the \nliterature\n39-40 for all 20 amino acids and they were also used in the program. The \nvalues for the latter two properties of the amino acids did not agree for the values from Synprops with those from the literature for these two properties, but when \nplotted, the curves were isomorphic with each other except for the value for \nhydrophobicity of lys. Conversion for Knapsack usually is less than one second. \nKnapsack has been very useful for studying the evolution of simple organisms from \ntheir frequency of occurrence of amino acid residues. \u0093Empirical programs\u0094 such as Chemkin exist to follow the kinetics of chemical reactions to their final results.  \n \n \nE6. Minimization of Free Energy as formulated by White and Dantzig\n41 \n \nWhite and Dantzig work states: When reliabl e and consistent thermodynamic data are \navailable, equilibrium calculations of biochemical species become accessible. The \nmethod of the minimization of free energy was pioneered by the Rand Corporation for \nthe most efficient method for this. In this method conservation of mass m gaseous \nelements used to form compounds under constant pressure Pi with aij atoms of the ith \nelement in one molecule of the jth compound, and with b i moles of the ith element \nand xj moles of the jth compound in the mixture yields: \n  \n \n 18in\nj jij bxa= \u2211=1 \n \nwith i = 1,\u0085, m  \n \nand xj equal to or greater than 0 and n equal to or greater than m. Subject to these \nconstraints it is desired to minimize the total Gibbs free energy of the system:  \n)) / (log(1 1 1 \u2211 \u2211 \u2211= = =+n\ni i jn\nj jn\nj jj x x x xc  \n \nwhere cj = Fj/RT+log P \nFj = Gibbs energy per mole of the jth gas at temperature T and unit atmosphere \npressure \nR = universal gas constant \n  \nE7. Reaction Pathway Network42 \n \nDrs. Fan and Friedler and associates42a have a method for selecting candidate \npathways or mechanisms of a reaction thr ough synthesis of networks of elementary \nreactions. This offers a way to reduce the number of reactions that may occur in the \nChemkin input and also a way to translate, more simply, the resulting reduced number \nof reactions into a network. This can yield a complete network, i.e., the maximal \nnetwork, for a given set of plausible elem entary reactions based on the combinatorial \nproperties of the reaction pathway. The su bnetworks containing intermediaries as \nproducts in addition to targets of th e reaction of concern (as byproducts) are \neliminated. The remaining networks that satisfy element conservation are finally \nselected as the feasible candidate networ ks or mechanisms. The number of these \nmechanisms is usually much smaller, great ly verifying the mechanism. The method is \nfirmly rooted in a set of combinatorial axioms and expressed in the terminology of \nprocess graphs or P-Graphs. The conversion of glucose to pyruvate with 14 \nelementary reactions follows a method fo r synthesizing networks of metabolic \npathways by this highly exacting combinatorial method42b. \n \n \nE8. Robust Self-Assembly Using Highly  Designable Structures and Self-\nOrganizing Systems35 \n \nThrough a statistical exploration of ma ny possibilities, self-assembly creates \nstructures. These explorations may give rise to some highly designable structures that can be formed in many different ways. If one uses such structures for self-assembly \ntasks, a general approach to improving their reliability will be realized. \n Manufacturing builds objects from their comp onents by placing them in prescribed \narrangements. This technique requires knowledge of the precise structure needed to \nserve a desired function, the ability to create the components with the necessary \ntolerances and the ability to place each component in its proper location in the final \nstructure.  \n 19If such requirements are not met, self-ass embly offers another approach to building \nstructures from components. This method invo lves a statistical exploration of many \npossible structures before settling into a possible one. The particular structure \nproduced from given components is determined by biases in the exploration, given by \ncomponent interactions. These may arise when the strength of the interactions \ndepends on their relative locations in the structure. These interactions can reflect \nconstraints on the desirability of a component being near its neighbors in the final \nstructure. For each possible structure the intersections combine to give a measure of \nthe extent to which the constraints are violated, which can be viewed as a cost of \nenergy for that structure. Through the biased  statistical exploration of structures, each \nset of components tends to assemble into that structure with the minimum energy for that set. Thus, self-assembly can be viewed as a process using a local specification, in \nterms of the components and their interactions, to produce a resulting global structure. \nThe local specification is, in effect, a set of instructions that implicitly describes the \nresulting structure. \n Self-assembly can form structures beyond the current capacity of direct \nmanufacturing. The most straight forward tec hnique for designing self-assembly is to \nexamine with a computer simulation, the neighbors of each component in the desired \nglobal structure, and then choose the interactions between components to encourage \nthese neighbors to be close together.  \nA difficulty in designing the self-assembly process is the indirect or emergent \nconnection between the interactions and the properties of resulting global structures. \nThere is a possibility of errors due to defective components or environmental noise. \nTo address this problem, it would be useful to arrange the self-assembly so the desired \nstructure can be formed in many ways, increasing the likelihood they will be correctly \nconstructed even with some unexpected changes in the components or their \ninteractions. That is, the resulting global stru cture should not be too sensitive to errors \nthat may occur in the local specification. \n A given assembly can then be characterized by the number of different component \nconfigurations producing a given global designability. Self-assembly processes with \nskewed distributions of designability can al so produce relatively large energy gaps for \nthe highly designable structures. A large energy gap with small changes in the \nenergies of all the global structures do not change the one with the minimum energy, \nbut small changes with a small gap are likely to change the minimum energy \nstructure. If there are several structures that adjust reasonably well to the frustrated \nconstraints in different ways, the energy differences among these local minima will determine the gap. \n \nSelf-assembly of highly designable structures  is particularly robust, both with respect \nto errors in the specification of the components and environmental noise. Thus we \nhave a general design principle for robust self-assembly: select the components, interactions and possible global structures so the types of structures desired for a \nparticular application are highly designable. \n \nApplying this principle requires two capabilities. The first is finding processes leading \nto highly designable structures of the desired forms. The second requirement is the ability to create the necessary interactions among the components. \n 20Achieving a general understanding of the conditions that give rise to highly \ndesignable structures is largely a computat ional problem that can be addressed before \nactual implementations become possible. Thus developing this principle for self-\nassembly design is particularly appropriate in situations where explorations of design \npossibilities take place well ahead of the necessary technological capabilities. Even \nafter the development of precise fabricatio n technologies, princi ples of robust self-\nassembly will remain useful for designing and programming structures that robustly \nadjust to changes in their environments or task requirements. \n \n \nE9. Self-Organizing Systems (SOS)35 \n Some mechanisms and preconditions are needed for systems to self-organize. The \nsystem must be exchanging energy and/or mass with its environment. A system must \nbe thermodynamically open because otherwise it would use up all the available usable \nenergy in the system (and maximize its entropy) and reach thermodynamic equilibrium. \n \nIf a system is not at or near equilibrium, then it is dynamic. One of the most basic \nkinds of change for SOS is to import usab le energy from its environment and export \nentropy back to it. Exporting entropy is another way to say that the system is not violating the second law of thermodynamics b ecause it can be seen as a larger system-\nenvironment unit. This entropy-exporting dynamic is the fundamental feature of what \nchemists and physicists call dissipative structures. Dissipation is the defining feature of SOS. \n \nThe magic of self-organization lies in the connections, interactions and feedback \nloops between the parts of the system, it is clear that SOS must have a large number \nof parts. These parts are often called agents because they have the basic properties of \ninformation transfer, storage and processing. \n The theory of emergence says the whole is greater than the sum of the parts, and the \nwhole exhibits patterns and structures that arise spontaneously from the parts. \nEmergence indicates there is no code for a higher-level dynamic in the constituent, lower-level parts. Emergence also points to the multiscale interactions and effects in \nself-organized systems. The small-scale interactions produce large-scale structures, \nwhich then modify the activities at the small scales. For instance, specific chemicals \nand neurons in the immune system can crea te organism-wide bodily sensations which \nmight then have a huge effect on the chemicals and neurons. Prigogine has argued that micro-scale emergent order is a way for a system to dissipate micro-scale entropy \ncreation caused by energy flux, but this  is still not theoretically supported. \n \nEven knowing that self-organization can occur in systems with these qualities, it\u0092s not \ninevitable, and it\u0092s still not clear why it sometime does. In other words, no one yet knows the necessary and sufficient  conditions for self-organization. \n \n \n \n \n \n 21F. BarCode and Intelligent Design43 \n \nGenetics originally discussed the nature of DNA, its constitution, organization and \nfunction and how a code leads to proteins. It is the nature and the function of the \nmyriad of proteins to lead to the essence of life. The process proceeds through the \nformation of a set of chemical compounds called amino acids using a coding that is known as the genetic code. The amino acids are then arranged in a sequence that is \npermuted, seemingly haphazardly, but actually by intelligent design on a backbone of \na peptide polymer or polypeptide and we call this structure a protein. A study of these \nproteins is known as proteomics. Proteins can change their form from stretched out \nstring- like molecules to fold into globule forms and in these forms can bring about many processes that are necessary to life. \n \nOne protein is be able to \u0093recognize\u0094 anot her protein. The characteristics of proteins \nare considered as properties and by that is mean the very physical, chemical and \nbiological properties that are described in SYNPROPS and others that have not been considered in that program. It would seem that this recognizability is portrayed in the \n\u0093shape space\u0094 of the proteins which is the description of a protein portrayed in a multi \ndimensional space, where the coordinates are properties rather than coordinates. \nPerhaps there is a morphic resonance or a morphogenetic sense set up by the proteins \nas in a \u0093Sheldrake\n44-45 sense\u0094 that is \u0093perceived by each protein and that is recognized \nby another protein. This field, whether set up by signaling or in another manner, is \nperceived by a protein as specific to another protein. This, of course, is an alternate \ntheory that contrasts with the \u0093lock and key\u0094 concept or docking concept that may help to lead to new drugs for battling or curing disease. \n \nBerkovich\n43 has suggested, \u0093the genome information plays the role of a \u0093barcode\u0094. \nThus the DNA structure is a pseudo-random number (PRN) with classification tags, \nso organisms are characterized by DNA as  library books are characterized by \ncatalogue numbers. Elaboration implicates the infrastructure of the physical Universe \nas a seat of biological information proce ssing. The PRN allows the biological objects \nto share facilities in the Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) mode, similarly to \ncellular phone connections. A community of users shares the phenomenon of Life as a \ncollective information processing activity and this is treated as a methodology of \nengineering design. The concept of the \u0093bar code\u0094 functionality of DNA confronts the \ndescriptive scientific doctrines with a unique operational scheme of biological \ninformation control. The vital constitu ent of life - unfolds as extracorporeal \ninformation processing in the cellular automaton infrastructure underlying the \nphysical world. These PRNs in nature serve the same purpose as SSNs in society - \nunique identification of systems\u0092 elements. A new organism starting from a zygote is \nequipped by its DNA with a unique identif ication number for opening \u0093an account\u0094 \non the \u0093Internet of the Physical Universe\u0094. \n \n \nG. The Need for Better Data \n In this review of work the need for better data is stressed. More data, as accurate as \npossible, is necessary to substantiate th e importance of programs such as Synprops, \nKnapsack and the Design of Molecules, Whether this data comes from Therm, NIST, \n 22or other sources, such data is important to us for the work of achieving success in \nbeneficial drug discovery and the understanding of life processes. \n \n \nConclusions \n A number of programs exist that can characterize biological networks. The analogy \nbetween biological networks and Graph Th eoretic Process Network Synthesis is \ndisplayed. A model of the critical regions of lattices is used to discuss systems \nbetween order and disorder of biological networks. A number of programs exist, such \nas Synprops, Therm, Knapsack, and those for the molecular design of molecules with specific properties that can elucidate biological networks. However, the physical and \nthermodynamic data that is accurate and c onsistent for biological molecules necessary \nfor these programs is lacking and efforts must be made to fulfill the need for reliable \ndata. \n \n 23H.

(See [3] and re ferences therein.) In\nalmost all attempts to combine epidemiological data with mathematica l modeling, there\nhas been a recognition of the need to consider the structure of so cial interactions among\nthe individuals in the populations. (See [11] and references therein.) Many authors have\n1\nconsidered the multigroup models in which heterogenus subpopulatio ns may participate\nto the epidemic process with di\ufb00erent parameters [2]. For SIS type m odels, a rather\ncomplete analysis of existence and global stability of a nontrivial epid emic state has been\ncarried out by Lajmanovich and York [7]. In their work, the size of ea ch subpopulation\nis assumed to be constant.\nA famous example for these subpopulations is the core group, i.e. th e highly sexually\nactive subgroups [5]. It has become increasingly clear that the tran smission within and\namong core subgroups is an important factor in the transmission of HIV/AIDS [6]. In\norder toconsider thecoregroupinanSISepidemiological model, we d ivide thepopulation\ninto two subgroups each of them consists of susceptible and infect ive individuals. One of\nthese subpopulations can be viewed as the core group. In this pape r we consider another\ntype of core group that is post-infection core group , i.e. individuals that become part\nof the core group after being infected. This hypothesis is plausible f or a contagious and\nfatal disease like AIDS. From the psychological perspective, this g roup may be classi\ufb01ed\nas violent.\nIn this paper we examine an SIS model of disease transmission in a pop ulation of\nvarying size with two dissimilar groups of infective individuals. One of th ese groups\ncan be viewed as the post-infection core group . We also assume tha t the birth rate of\nsusceptibles may be more than that of infectives. This is similar to the demographic\nassumption in [8]. This paper is mainly based on the discussion of the exis tence and\nstability of equilibria of the proportions system. First of all, in the nex t section, we\nintroduce the model and some concepts of ODE\u2019s related to the sys tem. In Section 3, we\npresent some basic results concerning the nonexistence of certa in types of solutions. In\nSection 4, we give a complete global analysis of the proportions syst em which is reduced\nto a planar system. The result is in terms of a threshold parameter w hich governs the\nstability of the disease free equilibrium.\n2\n2 The Model\nIn order to derive our model, we divide the population into three grou ps: Susceptibles,\nS, and two groups of infectives, I1andI2. We set N=S+I1+I2which is the total size\nof the population and we use the following parameters which are assu med to be positive\nunless otherwise speci\ufb01ed:\nb: per capita birth rate of susceptibles,\nb1: per capita birth rate of infectives which is assumed to be \u2264b,\nd: per capita disease free death rate,\n\u03b5: excess per capita death rate of infectives,\n\u03bb1: e\ufb00ective per capita contact rate of I1,\n\u03bb2: e\ufb00ective per capita contact rate of I2,\n\u03b31: per capita recovery rate of I1,\n\u03b32: per capita recovery rate of I2.\nWe also assume that the susceptible individuals which have been infect ed, enter to the\ngroupI1andI2of proportions pandqrespectively, hence p+q= 1.\nThe above hypotheses leads to the following system of di\ufb00erential e quations in R3\n+,\nwhere \u201c\u2032\u201d denotes the derivatives with respect to t, the time,\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3S\u2032=b1N+(b2\u2212d)S+\u03b31I1+\u03b32I2\u2212\u03bb1I1S\nN\u2212\u03bb2I2S\nN,(2\u22121)\nI\u20321=p/parenleftbig\n\u03bb1I1S\nN+\u03bb2I2S\nN/parenrightbig\n\u2212(d+\u03b5+\u03b31)I1, (2\u22122)\nI\u20322=q/parenleftbig\n\u03bb1I1S\nN+\u03bb2I2S\nN/parenrightbig\n\u2212(d+\u03b5+\u03b32)I2, (2\u22123)\nwhereb2=b\u2212b1and\u03bbjIj\nNis of the proportionate (or random) mixing type [9], [4]. By\nadding the above three equations, the total population equation is\nN\u2032= (b1\u2212d)N+b2S\u2212\u03b5(I1+I2)\n3\nSettings=S\nN,i1=I1\nNandi2=I2\nN, we arrive at the following system of equations:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3s\u2032=b1(1\u2212s)+b2s(1\u2212s)+\u03b31i1+\u03b32i2+(\u03b5\u2212\u03bb1)i1s+(\u03b5\u2212\u03bb2)i2s,(2\u22121)\u2032\ni\u2032\n1=ps(\u03bb1i1+\u03bb2i2)+\u03b5i1(i1+i2)\u2212(b1+\u03b5+\u03b31)i1\u2212b2si1, (2\u22122)\u2032\ni\u2032\n2=qs(\u03bb1i1+\u03bb2i2)+\u03b5i2(i1+i2)\u2212(b1+\u03b5+\u03b32)i2\u2212b2si2. (2\u22123)\u2032\nIn order to determine the asymptotic behaviour of the solutions of this system of\nequations, we need the following concepts of ODE\u2032srelated to our system.\nGiven an autonomous system of ordinary di\ufb00erential equations in Rn,\ndx\ndt=f(x), (2\u22125)\nwe will denote by x.t the value of the solution of this system at time t, that isxinitially.\nForV\u2286Rn,J\u2286R, we letV.J={x.t:x\u2208V,t\u2208J}. The set Vis called positively\ninvariant if V.R+=V. ForY\u2286Rnthe\u03c9-limit (resp. the \u03b1-limit) set of Yis de\ufb01ned to\nbe the maximal invariant set in the closure of Y.[0,\u221e) (resp.Y.(\u2212\u221e,0]). We say that\n\u03b3(t) is an orbit running from x0tox1if lim\nt\u2192\u2212\u221e\u03b3(t) =x0and lim\nt\u2192+\u221e\u03b3(t) =x1. These two\npoints must be equilibria and such an orbit is called heteroclinic orbit. Wh enx1coincides\nwithx0, it is called a homoclinic orbit. A closed curve connecting several equilib ria whose\nsegments between successive equilibria are heteroclinic orbits is calle d a phase polygon.\nByasinkwemeananequilibriumatwhichalltheeigenvaluesofthelineariz edsystemhave\nnegative real parts. Such a point is called a source if all of these eige nvalues have positive\nreal parts. If some of these eigenvalues have positive real parts and the others negative\nreal parts, then the equilibrium is called a saddle point and it is called non degenerate if\nall of these eigenvalues are nonzero.\n3 Some Basic Results\nWe start our analysis with some basic results about the system (2 \u22121)\u2032\u2212(2\u22123)\u2032. If we\nset \u03a3 =s+i1+i2, then \u03a3\u2032= (1\u2212\u03a3)(b1+b2s\u2212\u03b5i1\u2212\u03b5i2). Therefore the plane/summationtext= 1 is\ninvariant. We consider the feasibility region\nD={(s,i1,i2) :s+i1+i2= 1,s\u22650,i1\u22650,i2\u22650}\n4\nwhich is a triangle and on its sides we have:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3s= 0 =\u21d2s\u2032=b1+\u03b31i1+\u03b32i2,\ni1= 0 =\u21d2i\u2032\n1=p\u03bb2si2,\ni2= 0 =\u21d2i\u2032\n2=q\u03bb1si1.\nIt follows that Dis positively invariant and the disease free equilibrium (1 ,0,0) is the\nonly rest point on \u2202D, the boundary of D. Indeed our vector \ufb01eld points inward on\n\u2202D\u2212 {(1,0,0)}. So every solution of the system (2 \u22121)\u2032\u2212(2\u22123)\u2032which starts in\n\u2202D\u2212{(1,0,0)}, immediately gets into\u25e6\nD, the interior of D.\nFrom now on, we examine the dynamics of this system in the feasibility r egionD. The\nfollowing theorem is a modi\ufb01cation of Theorem 4.1 in [1], concerning the n onexistence of\ncertain types of solutions.\nTheorem 3.1. Letfbe a smooth vector \ufb01eld in R3and\u03b3(t) be a closed piecewise\nsmooth curve which is the boundary of an orientable smooth surfac eS\u2282R3. Suppose\ng:U\u2192R3is de\ufb01ned and is smooth in a neighborhood UofS. Moreover it satis\ufb01es\ng(\u03b3(t)).f(\u03b3(t))\u22650 and (curl g) \u00b7n <0, where nis the unit normal to S. Then\u03b3is not a\n\ufb01nite union of the orbits of the system (2-5).\nIn order to apply the above theorem, we de\ufb01ne g=g1+g2+g3by\ng1(i1,i2) =/bracketleftbigg\n0,\u2212f3(i1,i2)\ni1i2,f2(i1,i2)\ni1i2/bracketrightbigg\n,\ng2(s,i2) =/bracketleftbiggf3(s,i2)\nsi2,0,\u2212f1(s,i2)\nsi2/bracketrightbigg\n,\ng3(s,i1) =/bracketleftbigg\n\u2212f2(s,i1)\nsi1,\u2212f1(s,i1)\nsi1,0/bracketrightbigg\n,\nwheref1,f2andf3deduced by \u03a3 = 1 on the right hand side of (2 \u22121)\u2032,(2\u22122)\u2032and\n(2\u22123)\u2032respectively. Now after some computations we get\n(curlg).(1,1,1) =\u2212/parenleftbiggp\u03bb2\ni2\n1+q\u03bb1\ni2\n2+b1+\u03b31\ni2s2+b1+\u03b32\ni1s2/parenrightbigg\n.\nCorollary 3.2. The system (2 \u22121)\u2032\u2212(2\u22123)\u2032has no periodic orbits, homoclinic orbits\nor phase polygons in\u25e6\nD.\n5\nProof. WeuseTheorem3.1. for f= (f1,f2,f3). Herewehave g.f= 0and(curl g).(1,1,1)<\n0 in\u25e6\nD./square\nLemma 3.3. The\u03c9-limit set of each orbit of the system (2 \u22121)\u2032\u2212(2\u22123)\u2032with initial\npoint inDis a rest point.\nProof. Suppose the contrary, then the \u03c9-limit set has a regular point in\u25e6\nD. Letxbe\nsuch a point and hbe its \ufb01rst return map. For a point ynearxon the transversal, let V\nbe the region surrounded by the orbit \u03b3fromytoh(y) and the segment between them.\nThis region is known as Bendixon sack. (See Figure 3.1.)\nNow by Stokes\u2019 theorem\n/integraldisplay /integraldisplay\nV(curlg).(1,1,1)d\u03c3=/integraldisplay\n\u03b3g.fdt+/integraldisplay1\n0g(ty+(1\u2212t)h(y)).(y\u2212h(y))dt.\nSinceg.f= 0 andh(x) =x, the right hand side of the above equality tends to zero when\nytends to x. But the left hand side tends to the integral over the region bound ed by the\n\u03c9-limit set. This is a contradiction since (curl g).(1,1,1)<0 in\u25e6\nD./square\n\u2745\n\u2745\n\u2745\n\u2745\n\u2745\u273c\n\u2743\nFig. 3.1. The Bendixon sack.\nRemark 3.4. When the \u03c9-limit set lies in\u25e6\nDthe above result is easily concluded by the\ngeneralized Poincar\u00b4 e-Bendixon theorem [10] and Corollary 4.2. Simila rly if the \u03b1-limit\n6\nset of an orbit of the system (2 \u22121)\u2032\u2212(2\u22123)\u2032lies in\u25e6\nD, it must be a single point.\n4 The Planar System\nUsing the equality s+i1+i2= 1, we see that our system is essentially two dimensional.\nThus we can eliminate one of the variables, say s, to arrive at the following quadratic\nplanar system\n/braceleftBigg\ni\u2032\n1= (p\u03bb1\u2212b\u2212\u03b5\u2212\u03b31)i1+p\u03bb2i2+(i1+i2)((b2+\u03b5\u2212p\u03bb1)i1\u2212p\u03bb2i2),(3\u22121)\ni\u2032\n2=q\u03bb1i1+(q\u03bb2\u2212b\u2212\u03b5\u2212\u03b32)i2+(i1+i2)((b2+\u03b5\u2212q\u03bb2)i2\u2212q\u03bb1i1).(3\u22122)\nThe dynamics of the system (2 \u22121)\u2032\u2212(2\u22123)\u2032onDis equivalent to the dynamics of this\nplanar system in the positively invariant region\nD1={(i1,i2)|i1\u22650,i2\u22650,i1+i2\u22641}.\nThe matrix of the linearization of the system (3 \u22121),(3\u22122) at the origin is:\nC=/bracketleftBigg\np\u03bb1\u2212b\u2212\u03b5\u2212\u03b31 p\u03bb2\nq\u03bb1 q\u03bb2\u2212b\u2212\u03b5\u2212\u03b32/bracketrightBigg\n,\nwithdet C= (b+\u03b5+\u03b31)(b+\u03b5+\u03b32)\u2212p\u03bb1(b+\u03b5+\u03b32)\u2212q\u03bb1(b+\u03b5+\u03b31). We set\nR0=p\u03bb1\nb+\u03b5+\u03b31+q\u03bb2\nb+\u03b5+\u03b32. Hence if R0<1, thendet C > 0 andtrace C < 0 and ifR0>1\nthendet C <0. Thus we have proved the following lemma.\nLemma 4.1. LetR0be the above threshold. Then the origin is a sink (resp. a saddle)\nfor the system (3 \u22121),(3\u22122) whenever R0<1 (resp.R0>1).\nLemma 4.2. The trace of the linearization of the system (3 \u22121),(3\u22122) at a rest point\nin\u25e6\nD1is negative.\n7\nProof. We compute the trace at a rest point in\u25e6\nD1.\n\u2202i\u2032\n1\n\u2202i1=p\u03bb1\u2212b\u2212\u03b5\u2212\u03b31+(b2+\u03b5\u2212p\u03bb1\u2212p\u03bb2)i2+2(b2+\u03b5\u2212p\u03bb1)i1,\n\u2202i\u2032\n2\n\u2202i2=p\u03bb2\u2212b\u2212\u03b5\u2212\u03b32+(b2+\u03b5\u2212q\u03bb2\u2212q\u03bb1)i1+2(b2+\u03b5\u2212q\u03bb2)i2.\nFromi\u2032\n1= 0 and i\u2032\n2= 0, we get\n\u2202i\u2032\n1\n\u2202i1=\u2212p\u03bb2i2\ni1+p\u03bb2i2\n2\ni1+(b2+\u03b5\u2212p\u03bb1)i1=\u2212p\u03bb2i2\ni1(1\u2212i2)+(b2+\u03b5\u2212p\u03bb1)i1,\n\u2202i\u2032\n2\n\u2202i2=\u2212q\u03bb1i1\ni2+q\u03bb1i2\n1\ni2+(b2+\u03b5\u2212q\u03bb2)i2=\u2212q\u03bb1i1\ni2(1\u2212i1)+(b2+\u03b5\u2212q\u03bb2)i2.\nUsing the equality s+i1+i2= 1, we obtain\n\u2202i\u2032\n1\n\u2202i1+\u2202i\u2032\n2\n\u2202i2= (b2+\u03b5\u2212\u03bb1)i1+(b2+\u03b5\u2212\u03bb2)i2\u2212p\u03bb2i2s\ni1\u2212q\u03bb1i1s\ni2.\nNow from (2 \u22121)\u2032we have\ns\u2032=b1(i1+i2)+b2s(i1+i2)+\u03b31i1+\u03b32i2+(\u03b5\u2212\u03bb1)i1s+(\u03b5\u2212\u03bb2)i2s= 0.\nThus (b2+\u03b5\u2212\u03bb1)i1s+(b2+\u03b5\u2212\u03bb2)i2s <0 and it follows that\u2202i\u2032\n1\n\u2202i1+\u2202i\u2032\n2\n\u2202i2<0./square\nThe following two corollaries are immediate results of the above lemma.\nCorollary 4.3. The system (3 \u22121),(3\u22122) has no source in\u25e6\nD1.\nCorollary 4.4. Every nondegenerate rest point of the system (3 \u22121),(3\u22122) in\u25e6\nD1is\nhyperbolic.\nRemark 4.5. A nondegenerate rest point of the system (3 \u22121),(3\u22122) is obtained by\na transversal intersection of the two conic sections i\u2032\n1= 0 and i\u2032\n2= 0.\nProposition 4.6. There is at most one rest point in\u25e6\nD1for the system (3 \u22121),(3\u22122).\nMoreover such a rest point is always hyperbolic.\n8\nProof: Fromtheequilibrium conditions i\u2032\n1=i\u2032\n2= 0, weget thefollowing equation which\nis homogeneous with respect to i1andi2of second order.\n((p\u03bb1\u2212b\u2212\u03b5\u2212\u03b31)i1+p\u03bb2i2)((b2+\u03b5\u2212q\u03bb2)i2\u2212q\u03bb1i1) =\n(q\u03bb1i1+(q\u03bb2\u2212b\u2212\u03b5\u2212\u03b32)i2)((b2+\u03b5\u2212p\u03bb1)i1\u2212p\u03bb2i2).\nThis equality can be written as\nq\u03bb1(b1+\u03b31)i2\n1+(\u2217)i1i2\u2212p\u03bb2(b1+\u03b32)i2\n2= 0\nwhere (\u2217) is a statement in terms of the involved parameters. The set of all r oots of\nthis quadratic equation consists of two lines through the origin in the (i1,i2) plane. One\nof these lines has negative slope and meets D1only at the origin. Thus the other line\ncontains all rest points ofthe system (3 \u22121),(3\u22122) inD1. Since each line contains at most\ntwo rest points of a quadratic planar system and this line contains th e origin, it follows\nthat\u25e6\nD1contains at most one rest point. This rest point is obtained by a tran sversal\nintersection of this line and each of the conic sections i\u2032\n1= 0 ori\u2032\n2= 0. It is easy to\nsee that at this rest point, these two conic sections must intersec t transversally. Now by\nRemark 4.5, this rest point is nondegenerate and by Corollary 4.4, it m ust be hyperbolic.\n/square\nRemark 4.7. We have indeed shown that all rest points of the system (3 \u22121),(3\u22122)\nwhich are not more than three points, are nondegenerate, excep t the origin in the case\nR0= 1.\nNow we are ready to prove our main result about the dynamics of the system (2 \u2212\n1)\u2032\u2212(2\u22123)\u2032inD.\nTheorem 4.8. (i) IfR0\u22641, then (1 ,0,0) is a global attractor in D\n(ii) IfR0>1, then there exists a unique rest point (an endemic equilibrium) in\u25e6\nDwhich\nattractsD\u2212{(1,0,0)}.\nProof. WhenR0<1, the origin is a sink for the planar system (3 \u22121),(3\u22122). If there\nexists another rest point in\u25e6\nD1for this system, it must be unique and hyperbolic. By\n9\nCorollary 4.3 it cannot be a source. If it is a sink, then we will have two s inks inD1.\nThe basins of attraction of these two points are open and by Lemma 3.3,D1is the union\nof these two open subsets. This contradicts the connectedness ofD1and shows that it\ncannot be a sink. Now suppose that there is a saddle point in\u25e6\nD1. By Corollary 3.2,\nthere is no homoclinic orbit in\u25e6\nD1. Hence the origin attracts the unstable manifold of the\nsaddle point. Now the region bounded by the unstable manifold conta ins some part of\nthe stable manifold of of the saddle point. Thus the \u03b1-limit set of this part of the stable\nmanifold is a rest point in D1by Remark 3.4. This is a contradiction since this rest point\ncan be neither the origin nor the saddle point. Therefore the origin is the only rest point\ninD1for the system (3 \u22121),(3\u22122) and by Lemma 2.3, it is the \u03c9-limit set of all points\nofD1.\nThe above fact is still valid for the limiting case, R0= 1. To see this, suppose that\nthere exists another rest point in D1, then it must be hyperbolic and belong to\u25e6\nD1. Thus\nit remains in\u25e6\nD1when the involved parameters are slightly changed to get R0<1 which\ncontradicts the above result. This \ufb01nishes the proof of (i).\nNow suppose R0>1. Then the origin is a saddle point for the planar system (3 \u2212\n1),(3\u22122). Thus by Lemma 2.3, there must be some rest point in\u25e6\nD1. Since such a rest\npoint is unique and hyperbolic, it must be a sink and attract all points o fD1except the\nstable manifold of the origin. We claim that the stable manifold meets D1only at the\norigin. To see this notice that some part of the unstable manifold of t he origin must be\noutside of D1for its right angle. Since D1is positively invariant, the stable manifold\ndoes not intersect\u25e6\nD1. Moreover, the vector \ufb01eld points inward on \u2202D1\u2212{(0,0)}. Thus\nthe stable manifold of the origin does not intersect \u2202D1\u2212 {(0,0)}either. This shows\nthat the origin cannot attract any point of D1\u2212{(0,0)}. Thus the unique sink attracts\n\u25e6\nD1\u2212{(0,0)}. Itmeansthatthereisauniquerestpointin\u25e6\nDforthesystem(2 \u22121)\u2032\u2212(2\u22123)\u2032\nwhich attracts D\u2212{(1,0,0)}./square\nRemark 4.9. In the above argument, in order to prove the global asymptotic st ability\nof the endemic equilibrium (i.e. the unique rest point in\u25e6\nD1), we showed that the stable\nmanifold of the origin cannot intersect\u25e6\nD1. It is a special case of the following fact. Let\nXbe a smooth vector \ufb01eld on a smooth manifold MandD\u2282Mis a positively invariant\n10\nregion with a saddle point on \u2202D. If the unstable manifold of this saddle point contains a\npoint of ( M\u2212D)\u25e6, then its stable manifold cannot intersect\u25e6\nD. In order to prove it, one\ncan follow our proof in the special case and observe that this is a dire ct consequence of\nthe Hartman-Grobman theorem. However, it is obvious by the Inclin ation Lemma [10].\nRemark 4.10. If we consider I2as the post-infection core group, then the threshold\nR0=p\u03bb1\nb+\u03b5+\u03b31+q\u03bb2\nb+\u03b5+\u03b32clearly shows the e\ufb00ect of this group on the epidemics process.\nAlthough the probability qis a small number, the fact \u03bb2>> \u03bb1causes the term q\u03bb2to\nbe signi\ufb01cant.\nAcknowledgments.

Whereas some\nmodels for a single neuron are admittedly oversimpli-\n\ufb01ed from the biological viewpoint, when networked they\nexhibit a variety of neural functions, performed by liv-\ning systems and demanded from arti\ufb01cial designs. In\nthis Letter we study a single perceptron-type neuron\u2019s\nmemorization ability, crucial for the understanding of\nnetworked systems. When the number of synaptic cou-\nplings of a neuron becomes large the storageproblem can\nbe described via the statistical mechanical framework in-\ntroduced by Gardner and Derrida [2,3]. Since then the\nneuron is well understood below capacity, the region be-\nyond it, however, remained the subject of continuous re-\nsearch and debate [4\u20139]. We claim that the framework\npresented here carriesthe exact statistical mechanicalso-\nlution, which we illustrate on a partly analytically treat-\nable limiting case. Networks beyond saturation are long\nknown to have complex features; here we show that even\na single neuron can exhibit extreme complexity.\nWe consider the McCulloch-Pitts model neuron [1],\n\u03be= sign(h), h=N\u22121/2/summationdisplayN\ni=1JiSi, (1)\nwhereJis the vector of synaptic couplings, Sthe input\nand\u03bethe response. The normalization was chosen so\nthathis typically of O(1) when N\u2192 \u221e. Patterns to\nbe stored are prescribed as pairs {S\u00b5,\u03be\u00b5}M\n\u00b5=1such that\nthe neuron is required to generate \u03be\u00b5in response to S\u00b5.\nGiven the ensemble of patterns, the local stability pa-\nrameter \u2206\u00b5=h\u00b5\u03be\u00b5obeys some distribution \u03c1(\u2206) (see\n[4]). The \u00b5-th pattern is stored by the neuron if theactual response signal from Eq. (1) equals the desired\noutput\u03be\u00b5,i. e., \u2206\u00b5>0. The number of patterns M\nis generically of order N, so\u03b1=M/Nis an intensive\nparameter. For the sake of simplicity, we generate the\nS\u00b5\ni-s independently from a normal distribution, consider\n\u03be\u00b5=\u00b11 equally likely, and choose the spherical prior\nconstraint |J|=\u221a\nN. The cost function to be minimized,\ni. e., the Hamiltonian, is the sum of errors committed on\nthe patterns. The error on the \u00b5-th pattern is measured\nby a potential V(\u2206\u00b5), taken here to be zero for argu-\nments larger than a given \u03baand decreasing elsewhere [4].\nStorage as de\ufb01ned above corresponds to \u03ba= 0, while a\n\u03ba >0 means a stricter requirement on the local stability\n\u2206 and ensures a \ufb01nite basin of attraction for a memo-\nrized pattern during retrieval. The Hamiltonian de\ufb01nes\nthrough gradient descent a dynamics in coupling space.\nSpeci\ufb01cally, V(y) = (\u03ba\u2212y)b\u03b8(\u03ba\u2212y) corresponds to the\nperceptron and adatron rules for b= 1,2, respectively.\nThere is no such dynamics in the case b= 0, but because\nofits prominent static meaning \u2013 the Hamiltonian counts\nthe incorrectly stored patterns \u2013 we will consider that in\nconcrete calculations.\nThe Hamiltonian introduced above gives rise to a\nstatistical mechanical system [2] resembling models of\nspin glasses with in\ufb01nite-range interactions [10]. The\nmicrostates are con\ufb01gurations of synaptic couplings,\nquenched disorder is due to the randomly generated pat-\nterns, and the temperature T=\u03b2\u22121represents the tol-\nerance to error of storage.

Be-\nyond capacity at zero temperature, however, Bouten\n[5] showed by rectifying [2,3] that whenever the lo-\ncal stability distribution function \u03c1(\u2206) exhibits a gap,\nthere is an eigenvalue in negative in\ufb01nity of the Hes-\nsian\u22022f(Q)/\u2202qab\u2202qcdat the RS solution, so this is not\na minimum in (3). Such is the case for the potential\nV(y) =\u03b8(y\u2212\u03ba). Theonestep replicasymmetrybreaking\n(1-RSB)ansatzwasconsideredfor T= 0, yieldinga \u03c1(\u2206)\ndi\ufb00erent from the RS result, and, as demanded from an\nimproved solution, a larger energy [6\u20138]. In the ground\nstatebeyondcapacity, whereall qab\u21921, aneigenvalueof\nnegative in\ufb01nity has been found recently for any R-step\nRSB (R-RSB), and for illustration the 2-RSB solution\ncomputed [9]. The results show a slight improvement\nover 1-RSB in the energy and a signi\ufb01cant di\ufb00erence in\nthescaledelementsof Q, but alsothe2-RSBgroundstate\nturned out to be unstable. Ref. [9] in fact implied that a\ngap in\u03c1(\u2206) atT= 0 means the instability of all R-RSB\nsolutions with R\ufb01nite.\nIn order to treat the storage problem of the neu-\nron we technically generalize Parisi\u2019s method for the\nSherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model of spin glasses (see\n[10]). By Parisi\u2019s choice of Qand his continuation rule\nin then\u21920 limit, the SK free energy was expressed in\nterms of an order parameter function. An elegant and\nuseful re-formulation was due to [11], whose free energy\nfunctional for the SK problem incorporated both Parisi\u2019s\nand Sompolinsky\u2019s partial di\ufb00erential equations (PPDE\nand SPDE, resp.). Its analog was used for the Little-\nHop\ufb01eld (LH) memory network in [12]. For the neuron,\nwe adopt Parisi\u2019s form for Q, momentarily as an ansatz,\nbut thermodynamical stability analysis reported about\nlater amounts to its consistency check. Our calculations\nshow that despite the signi\ufb01cant di\ufb00erences between the\nSK and the neuron Hamiltonians and those between the\n\u2019hard\u2019 terms in the replica free energies, the variational\nfree energies are remarkably similar.

(7e)\nThe minimization in (3) turned to maximization due to\nits interchange with the n\u21920 limit [10]. Here and later\n\u02d9h=\u2202h/\u2202qandh\u2032=\u2202h/\u2202y. Thex(q) is the inverse of\nParisi\u2019s order parameter function, i. e., it gives the prob-\nability that the overlap of the synaptic vectors from two\nreplicas is smaller than q, andD(q) =/integraltext1\nqd\u00afqx(\u00afq) is the\ncontinuation of the spectrum of the matrix Qforn\u21920.\nThe range 1 \u2265q\u22650 is now included in the ansatz, that\nshould be veri\ufb01ed later. The auxiliary functionals f(1,2)\na\ncarry the Lagrange multiplier \ufb01eld P(q,y) and thus van-\nish at stationarity. Variation by P(q,y) makes the \ufb01eld\nf(q,y)satisfythePPDE,whichcanbereado\ufb00from(7d),\nand that by P(1,y) \ufb01xes the initial condition through\n(7e). So f(q,y) evolves from q= 1 toq= 0 and its \ufb01nal\nvalue gives the energy term in (7c). Stationarity in terms\noff(q,y) andf(0,y) leads to the SPDE\n\u02d9P(q,y) =1\n2P\u2032\u2032(q,y)+\u03b2x(q)[P(q,y)f\u2032(q,y)]\u2032,(8)\nevolving from P(0,y) =\u03b4(y) untilq= 1. Comparison\nwith the SKmodel [11], its p-spingeneralization[14], and\nthe LHnetwork[12] showsthat the respectivePDE-sand\nP(0,y) arethe same, but in our casea generalinitial con-\nditionf(1,y) =V(y) is taken. In fact, the \u2019hard\u2019 term of\ntheSKreplicafreeenergyisformallyaspecialcaseof(4c)\nifV(y) = ln2cosh y. Variation of (7a) in terms of explicit\noccurrences of x(q) yields (2 \u03b2)\u22121/integraltext1\n0dqF(q,[x(\u00afq)])\u03b4x(q),\nwhere\nF(q,[x(\u00afq)]) =/integraldisplayq\n0d\u02dcq\nD(\u02dcq)2\u2212\u03b3/integraldisplay\u221e\n\u2212\u221edyP(q,y)f\u2032(q,y)2(9)\nis simultaneously a function of qand a functional of\nx(\u00afq), with\u03b3=\u03b1\u03b22. So wherever \u02d9 x(q)>0 stationar-\nity requires that F= 0. If x(q)\u2261m, 0< m < 1,\nin an interval Ithen stationarity in terms of mleads\nto Maxwell\u2019s rule/integraltext\nIdqF(q,[x(\u00afq)]) = 0. The R-RSB\nansatz involves a sequence q(R)\n0< ... < q(R)\nRand has\nx(q) =/summationtextR\nk=0(m(R)\nk+1\u2212m(R)\nk)\u03b8(q\u2212q(R)\nk), withm(R)\n0= 0\u2264\nm(R)\n1\u2264...\u2264m(R)\nR+1= 1. Itisnaturallyincorporatedinto\nthe above scheme: required is F= 0 at each of the points\nq(R)\n0,...,q(R)\nRand so is the Maxwell rule in the intervals\nbetween them ( cf.[15] in a special case). Note that the\nfree energy can be written in short as max x(q)[fs+\u03b1fe]\nwith (7b,7c), where f(q,y) satis\ufb01es the PPDE with the\ninitial condition as above; that corresponds to Parisi\u2019s\noriginal formulation.\nThermodynamical stability analysis requires the diag-\nonalization of the Hessian of f(Q) in Eq. (4). Based on\n2\nthe general expression of Ref. [16] we calculated a subset\nof eigenvalues from the replicon sector of the R-RSB, in-\ncluding\u03bb(R)(R) =\u02d9F(q(R)\nR,[x(\u00afq)])thatderivesfromstates\nin the same smallest cluster. The \u03bb(R)(R) is typically de-\ncisive for stability [15,14], and becomes negative in\ufb01nity\natT= 0 for any R-RSB with \ufb01nite Rif\u03c1(\u2206) has a gap\n[5,9]. Concerning the maximizing x(q) of (7), if \u02d9 x(q)>0\nin an interval Ithen the continuation of the aforemen-\ntioned subset is \u03bb(q) =\u02d9F(q,[x(\u00afq)]), so\u03bb(q)\u22610 inI,\nthus zero modes are present. This is a generic property\nof a Parisi phase [17].\nThe distribution of the local stability \u2206 is found to be\nof a remarkably simple form [13]\n\u03c1(\u2206) =P(1,\u2206). (10)\nThat sheds light on the physical meaning of the auxiliary\n\ufb01eldP(q,y):yis the local stability at an intermediate\ngeneration of the ultrametric tree and P(q,y) its proba-\nbility distribution. The analogy with the local magnetic\n\ufb01eld in the SK and LH models [11,18,12] is apparent.\nClassic neural modeling focuses on T= 0. To solve\nthat problem, however, extensive numerical work may\nbe necessary. On the other hand, in the limit \u03b1, T\u2192 \u221e\nwhile\u03b3is kept \ufb01nite, we can calculate x(q) wherever it\ndeviates from the step-like shape, thence other analytic\nresults follow. By resolving the PPDE and the SPDE\nperturbatively we obtain f(q,y) andP(q,y) as function-\nals ofx(q) toO(\u03b22), yielding explicit functional forms for\nthe free energy (7) as well as for (9). Another possibility\nis \ufb01rst expanding (4) in \u03b2and then applying the Parisi\nansatz. Either way we arrive at\n\u03b22f=\u03c60+\u03b2max\nx(q)[\u03c61]+O(\u03b22) (11a)\n\u03c60=\u03b3/radicalbig\nW(0) (11b)\n\u03c61=\u03b2fs+\u03b2\u03b3f(1)\ne (11c)\n\u03b2f(1)\ne=1\n2/integraldisplay1\n0dqx(q)\u02d9W(q) (11d)\nW(q) =/integraldisplay/integraldisplay\u221e\n\u2212\u221ed2texp/parenleftbig\n\u22121\n2|t|2/parenrightbig\n2\u03c0V(n1\u00b7t)V(n2\u00b7t),(11e)\nwhere|n1,2|= 1 and n1\u00b7n2=q.

Various trial functions x(q), such\nas anR-RSB, or, Parisi\u2019s ansatz of a continuous orderparameter function between two plateaux (such a clas-\nsic Parisi phase will be referred to as SG-I), can be for-\nmulated by means of (12). We calculated the full set\nof replicon eigenvalues of R-RSB based on [16]. With\nr= 0,...,R\u22121 andk,l=r+1,...,Rwe have\n\u03bb(r;k,l) =D(q(R)\nk)\u22121D(q(R)\nl)\u22121\u2212\u03b3\u00a8W(q(R)\nr),(14)\nand\u03bb(R)(R) is obtained if q(R)\nRis substituted for all q-s\nin (14). We studied the example V(y) =\u03b8(\u03ba\u2212y) when\n\u02d9W(q) = (2\u03c0)\u22121(1\u2212q2)\u22121/2exp/parenleftbig\n\u03ba2/(1+q)/parenrightbig\n.(15)\nFour distinct phases are found and depicted on Fig. 1.\nAt the boundary of the transition RS\u2014SG-I, further-\nmore, at the RS\u20141-RSB line for \u03ba < \u03ba2, if the border is\napproached from the RSB phase, the x(q) function con-\nverges for each 0 \u2264q\u22641 to the RS value q(0). Here the\n3rd derivative of the mean free energy is discontinuous.\nOn the other hand, for \u03ba > \u03ba 2, if the RS\u20131-RSB line\nis approached from the RSB side then q(1)\n0\u2192q(0)but\nq(1)\n1/ne}ationslash\u2192q(0). The plateau value m(1)\n1\u21921 so the limits\nofx(q) from the two phases di\ufb00er at one point q= 1.\nAt that transition the 2nd derivative of the free energy\nis discontinuous. This phenomenon is analogous to the\nRS\u20141-RSB transition in the random energy model (see\n[10]), and similar two types of segments of the RS\u20141-\nRSBborderlinewereidenti\ufb01edinthespherical, p-spinSK\nmodel by [15]. The RS\u2014SG-I boundary is analogous to\nthe Parisi transition in the SK model. We found a fourth\nphase, where x(q) is like an SG-I curve joined with a 1-\nstep function. It is ofthe same type asthe phase PG II of\nthe Potts spin glass [20], and the low-temperature state\nof thep-spin SK model [14], furthermore, it is analogous\nto the phase SG-IV of [21]. The borderline \u03bb(0)(0) = 0\nof local stability of the RS state, i. e., the de Almeida--\nThouless (AT) curve, coincides with the border of the RS\nphase for \u03ba < \u03ba 2but enters the RSB phases for larger\n\u03ba-s. However, whenever RS and RSB states coexist, we\n\ufb01nd that the RSB state maximizes the free energy func-\ntional(7). No coexistencebetweendi\ufb00erenttypes ofRSB\nphases was observed. One characteristic x(q) function\nfrom each phase is shown on Fig. 2. Note that if x(q)\nhas a curved segment, this is explicitly given by Eqs.\n(13,15). For illustration, thermodynamic quantities are\nplotted along the \u03ba= 0 line on Fig. 3. We expect that\nfor some \ufb01nite temperatures similar phases exist, never-\ntheless, in the ground state the phase diagram simpli\ufb01es\nto the single borderline RS\u2014SG-I, i. e., the known limit\nof capacity curve. The richness of the neural behavior\nforT\u2192 \u221eshould be contrasted with the generic RS\nhigh-T-phase in SK-type disordered magnets.\nIn conclusion, we have put forth an exact description\nof storage by a single neuron in terms of a variational\nfree energy, the solution of which we demonstrated in the\nhighTlimit with the error counting potential. Storage\n3\nbeyond capacity with other error measures, learning and\ngeneralizationofunlearnabletasks, storageby networked\nneurons, and frustrated phases in general, are natural\ndirections for future investigations.\nSpecial thank is due to T.

INTRODUCTION AND RESULTS\nBacterial growth in a petri dish, the basic experiment of microbiolog y, is a familiar but interesting phenomenon.\nDepending on the nutrient and agar concentration, a variety of int riguing growth patterns have been observed [1\u20134].\nSome regimes can be modeled by di\ufb00usion limited aggregation, others b y Eden models, and still others exhibit ring\nstructures or a two-dimensional modulation in the bacterial densit y. At high nutrient concentration and low agar\ndensity, there is a large regime of simple growth of a circular patch (a fter point innoculation), described by a Fisher\nequation [5], and studied experimentally in Ref. [1].\nOf course, most bacteria do not live in petri dishes, but rather in inh omogeneous environments characterized by,\ne.g., spatially varying growth rates and/or di\ufb00usion constants. Oft en, as in the soil after a rain storm (or in a sewage\ntreatment plant), bacterial di\ufb00usion and growth are accompanied by convective drift in an aqueous medium through\nthe disorder. By creating arti\ufb01cially modulated growth environment s in petri dishes, one can begin to study how\nbacteria (and other species populations) grow in circumstances mo re typical of the real world. More generally, the\nchallenges posed by combining inhomogeneous biological processes w ith various types of \ufb02uid \ufb02ows [6] seem likely to\nattract considerable interest in the future. The easiest problem t o study in the context of bacteria is to determine\nhow \ufb01xed spatial inhomogeneities and convective \ufb02ow a\ufb00ect the simp le regime of Fisher equation growth mentioned\nabove.\nA delocalization transition in inhomogeneous biological systems has re cently been proposed, focusing on a single\nspecies continuous growth model, in which the population disperses v ia di\ufb00usion and convection [7]: the Fisher\nequation [5] for the population number density c(x,t), generalized to account for convection and an inhomogeneous\ngrowth rate, reads [7,8]\n\u2202c(x,t)/\u2202t=D\u22072c(x,t)\u2212v\u00b7\u2207c(x,t)\n+U(x)c(x,t)\u2212bc2(x,t), (1)\nwhereDis the di\ufb00usion constant of the system, vis the spatially homogeneous convection (\u201cwind\u201d) velocity, and bis\na phenomenological parameter responsible for the limiting of the con centrationc(x,t) to some maximum saturation\nvalue (by competition processes of the kind A+A\u21920 [8]). The growth rate U(x) is a random function which\ndescribes a spatially random nutrient concentration, or, for phot osynthetic bacteria, an inhomogeneous illumination\npattern [7]. If U(x) is constant over the entire sample, then the convection term \u2212v\u00b7 \u2207c(x,t) has no e\ufb00ect on the\ngrowth of the bacteria. Only the introduction of a spatial depende nce for the growth rate U(x) makes the convection\nterm interesting. In the following we consider the simple case of a \u201csq uare-well potential\u201d shape for U(x), imposing\na positive growth rate aon an illuminated patch (\u201coasis\u201d), and a negative growth rate \u2212\u01ebaoutside (\u201cdesert\u201d) [9]:\nU(x) =\uf8f1\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f3a,for|x|<W\n2,\n\u2212\u01eba,for|x| \u2265W\n2,(2)\n1\nwhereWis the diameter of the oasis. Experimentally this could be realized using a very simple setup, which\nboth illustrates the basic ideas of localization and delocalization, and le ads to interesting further questions. A one\ndimensional example is shown in \ufb01gure 1, where a solution with photosy nthetic bacteria in a thin circular pipe, or\nannular petri dish, is illuminated by a \ufb01xed uniform light source throug h a mask, leading to a \u201csquare well\u201d intensity\ndistribution. The mask is moved at a small, constant velocity around t he sample to simulate convective \ufb02ow. (Moving\nthe mask is equivalent to introducing convective \ufb02ow in the system, u p to a change of reference frame [10].) The\nbacteria are assumed to divide in the brightly illuminated area (\u201coasis\u201d ) at a certain rate, but division ceases or\nproceeds at a greatly reduced rate in the darker region (\u201cdesert \u201d) outside. As a result, the growth rate in this\ncontinuum population dynamics model is positive in the oasis and small ( positive or negative) in the surrounding\ndesert region. Using this simple nonlinear growth model, we discuss pr edictions for the total number of bacteria\nexpected to survive in the steady state, the shape of their distrib ution in space and other quantities, as a function of\nthe \u201cconvection velocity\u201d of the light source.\nvW\nFIG. 1. Experimental setup: a solution with photosynthetic bacteria in a circular pipe or a thin annular track in a petri d ish,\nis illuminated only in a small area, while the rest of the samp le is either kept dark or illuminated with reduced intensity . The\nlight source is moved slowly around the sample to model conve ctive \ufb02ow. The bacteria are assumed to divide in the illumina ted\narea (\u201coasis\u201d) at a certain growth rate a >0, and die (or grow modestly) in the remaining area (\u201cdesert\u201d ) with growth rate\n\u2212\u01eba.\nIt is interesting to consider the class of biological situations discuss ed in this paper in the context of the \u201dcritical\nsize problem\u201d in population dynamics [11]. In the critical size problem on e asks for the minimal size of habitat for the\nsurvival of a population undergoing logistic growth and di\ufb00usion, whe re the region is surrounded by a totally hostile\nenvironment, i.e., no drift and an in\ufb01nite death rate outside the oasis . We show here that the linearized version of the\ncritical size problem is closely related to a well known problem in quantu m mechanics, and present a generalization of\nthis problem to include other types of surrounding environments, a s well as the e\ufb00ect of drift. The linearized version\nof equation (1) around c(x,t) = 0 reads\n\u2202c(x,t)/\u2202t=Lc(x,t), (3)\nwith the linearized growth operator\nL=D\u22072\u2212v\u00b7\u2207+U(x). (4)\n(We discuss later the validity of this linear approximation and compare the results with lattice simulations of the\nfull nonlinear problem.) For nonzero convection velocity v,Lis non-Hermitian, but it can still be diagonalized by\na complete set of right and left eigenvectors, {\u03c6R\nn(x)}and{\u03c6L\nn(x)}, with eigenvalues \u0393 n[12,7], and orthogonality\ncondition\n2\n/integraldisplay\nddx\u03c6L\nm(x)\u03c6R\nn(x) =\u03b4m,n, (5)\n(dis the dimension of the substrate, we focus here on d= 1 ord= 2).

(7)\nFigure 2 shows the complex eigenvalue spectrum with the potential ( 2) for four di\ufb00erent values of the convection\nvelocityv, for a one dimensional lattice approximation to (4) (see Appendix A) with periodic boundary conditions.\nThe derivation of these results is discussed in section II below. At ze ro velocity Lis Hermitian and all eigenvalues\n\u0393nare real. There are bound states (discrete spectrum) and exten ded or delocalized states (continuous spectrum).\nAt \ufb01nite velocities, all except one of the delocalized states acquire a complex eigenvalue. States with positive real\npart of the eigenvalue ( Re\u0393n>0) grow exponentially with time, states with negative real part ( Re\u0393n<0) decrease\nexponentially with time (see Eq. (6)). In a large one dimensional syst em the \u201cmobility edge\u201d [13], which we de\ufb01ne to\nbe the eigenvalue of the fastest growing delocalized state, (i.e. the rightmost eigenvalue in the complex parabolas of\n\ufb01gure 2), is located at the overall average growth rate\n\u0393\u2217=/an}b\u2207acketle{tU/an}b\u2207acket\u2207i}ht \u2261/integraldisplayL\n0dxU(x)/L\u2243 \u2212\u01eba, (8)\n(up to corrections of order O(1/L) where the system size Lis the mean circumference of the annulus in \ufb01gure 1).\nIn \ufb01gure 2, the eigenvalues of the localized states compose the disc rete, real spectrum to the right of the mobility\nedge. With increasing velocity these localized eigenvalues move to the left by an amount proportional to v2/4D, and\nsuccessively enter the continuous delocalized spectrum through t he mobility edge, which remains \ufb01xed. The parabola\nbroadens in the vertical direction \u2013 the imaginary parts of the eigen values of the delocalized states grow by an amount\nproportional to v. A given localized right eigenfunction \u03c6R\nnundergoes a \u201cdelocalization transition\u201d when the velocity\nreaches a corresponding critical delocalization velocity v=v\u2217\nn, at which its eigenvalue \u0393 nhas been shifted so far to\nthe left that it just touches \u0393\u2217. At higher velocities it joins the parabola of eigenvalues describing a c ontinuum of\ndelocalized states. The ease with which such a delocalization transitio n can be observed experimentally depends on\nwhether there are growing delocalized eigenstates in the system, i.e . whether the mobility edge has a positive real\nvalue or not.\n3\n-1.1 -0.9 -0.7 -0.5 -0.3 -0.1 0.1 0.3 0.5 0.7\nRe{\u0393n}/U0-2.0-1.5-1.0-0.50.00.51.01.52.0Im{\u0393n}/U0Spectrum for different drift velocities\n(Extinction Transition at v/vF ~1)\n1.39\n0.93\nv/vF =00.39\nFIG. 2.

As described in the introduction, the mobility edge remains roughly \ufb01xed, and the parabola of t he\ndelocalized eigenvalues opens up as v/vFis increased. The real, localized eigenvalues move to the le ft for higher velocities. At\nv/vF\u22651.39 all states are delocalized. (This \ufb01gure actually only sho ws the part of the spectrum which corresponds to the\ncontinuum problem. The lattice calculation also yields a le ft part of the spectrum \u2013 not shown here \u2013 which is an artifact o f\nthe discrete lattice.)\nIn a large \u201cdeadly\u201d desert ( /an}b\u2207acketle{tU/an}b\u2207acket\u2207i}ht \u2243 \u2212\u01eba<0) all delocalized states die out, because the mobility edge lies to the le ft\nof the origin, as in \ufb01gure 2. The growth rate of each localized eigenst ate\u03c6R\nnthen becomes negative at a corresponding\n\u201cextinction\u201d velocity vncwhich is smaller than the corresponding delocalization velocity v\u2217\nn. Thus, as convection\nis increased, the population dies out before it can delocalize. Later in this paper, we make speci\ufb01c predictions for\nthe behavior of populations near the extinction transition, which oc curs forv=v0c> vncfor alln >0, when the\neigenvalue of the localized \u201cground state\u201d (fastest growing eigenf unction of L) passes through the origin.\nIf the average growth rate /an}b\u2207acketle{tU/an}b\u2207acket\u2207i}htis positive ( i.efor a small enough desert or a small positive growth rate in an in\ufb01nite\ndesert), the mobility edge lies to the right of the origin and the deloca lization transition can indeed be observed at\nv=v\u2217\n0where the \u201cground state\u201d becomes delocalized. One expects to se euniversal behavior near this delocalization\ntransition, since there is a diverging correlation length in the system , which renders microscopic details irrelevant\nfor certain quantities. We report predictions (see also [14]), for qu antities such as the dependence of the localization\nlength on the drift velocity as it approaches the delocalization velocit y, and the shape of the concentration pro\ufb01le\nnear the transition.\nA special (universal) behavior is expected for the spatially average growth rate /an}b\u2207acketle{tU/an}b\u2207acket\u2207i}ht= 0.

LINEARIZED GROWTH IN ONE DIMENSION\nIf the left and right eigenfunctions \u03c6R,L\nn(x) are localized ( i.e.if the convection velocity is small enough, so that\n\u03c6R,L\nn(x) decays exponentially with the distance from the oasis), one may elim inate the convective term in Eq. (4) via\nthe transformation\n\u03c6R,L\nn(x) = exp(\u00b1v\u00b7x/2D)\u03c8n(x) (9)\n(+ refers to the right eigenvectors and \u2212to the left eigenvectors). The eigenvalue equation associated with the\nlinearized growth operator (3) becomes Hermitian [15]\n\u0393n\u03c8n(x) =D\u22072\u03c8n(x)+U(x)\u03c8n(x)\u2212(v2/4D)\u03c8n(x), (10)\nand is equivalent to the familiar square well potential problem much st udied in quantum mechanics. With the\nidenti\ufb01cations a+\u01eba\u2261U0/\u00afh, whereU0is a quantum well depth, and \u00af his Planck\u2019s constant, \u0393 n+\u01eba+v2/4D\u2261 |E|/\u00afh,\n5\nwhereEis a quantum energy level, and D\u2261\u00afh/2m, wheremis a mass in the equivalent quantum problem, we can use\nwell known quantum mechanical results [16,17]. The left and right eige nfunctions at \ufb01nite velocity are then related to\nthe eigenstates of the Hermitian problem (10) via the transformat ion (9), while the eigenvalues undergo a rigid shift\n\u0393n(v) = \u0393n(v= 0)\u2212v2\n4D. (11)\nA. An Oasis in an In\ufb01nite Desert: Localized Populations and t he Extinction Transition\nIn an in\ufb01nite one dimensional system, localized solutions for \u03c6R,L\nn(x) are given by Eq. (9) with [18]\n\u03c8n(x) =\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3A1,nexp(\u03banx), forx<\u2212W\n2,\nB1,nexp(iknx)+B2,nexp(\u2212iknx),for\u2212W\n2<x<W\n2,\nA2,nexp(\u2212\u03banx), forx>W\n2,(12)\nwhereA1,n,A2,n,B1,n,andB2,nare constant coe\ufb03cients, and\n\u03ban=/radicalbig\n(\u0393n(v= 0)+\u01eba)/D, (13)\nand\nkn=/radicalbig\n(a\u2212\u0393n(v= 0))/D, (14)\nas can be seen by substituting the above Ansatz for \u03c8(x) into Eq. (10). Eq. (13) implies\n\u0393n(v= 0) =D\u03ba2\nn\u2212\u01eba. (15)\nTo compute \u0393 n(v= 0) one matches both \u03c8n(x) and\u2202\u03c8n(x)/\u2202xatx=\u00b1W/2, which determines the coe\ufb03cients\nAi,n,Bi,n,i= 1,2, up to an overall multiplicative factor, as well as the eigenvalues {\u0393n(v= 0)}. When solving the\nHermitian problem one may use the fact that all the eigenfunctions a dmit a well de\ufb01ned parity, i.e., they are odd or\neven under the transformation x\u2192 \u2212x. Even integers ncorrespond to bound eigenstates with even parity, where\n\u03c8n(x), is symmetric under x\u2192 \u2212x. In such a case one obtains the eigenvalue equation for the quantit y\n\u03b6n(\u0393n)\u2261knW/2 =W/2/radicalbig\n(a\u2212\u0393n(v= 0))/D, (16)\nnamely,\ncot(\u03b6n) =\u03b6n\u00afx//radicalbig\n1\u2212(\u03b6n\u00afx)2, (17)\n(which is equivalent to cot( knW/2) =kn/\u03ban), with\n\u00afx= 2/radicalbig\nD/(a+\u01eba)/W= 2/(/radicalbig\nk2n+\u03ba2nW). (18)\nThe dimensionless parameter \u00af xmeasures the ratio of kinetic to potential energy in the equivalent q uantum problem.\nFor bound eigenstates with odd parity \u03c8(x), (\u03c8(x) antisymmetric under x\u2192 \u2212x, denoted by odd n) one obtains\ncot(\u03b6n) =\u2212/radicalbig\n1\u2212(\u03b6n\u00afx)2/(\u03b6n\u00afx). (19)\nThehighesteigenvalue(withitsnodeless,positiveeigenfunction \u03c80(x)), correspondstothelargestgrowthrate Re{\u03930},\nand is therefore expected to dominate the system in most cases at long times, as seen from Eq. (6). Its eigenvalue\ncondition (17) for n= 0 leads to [16]\n\u03930(v= 0)+\u01eba= (a+\u01eba)f(\u00afx), (20)\nwheref(\u00afx) is a monotonically decreasing function such that f(\u00afx)\u22431\u2212\u03c02\u00afx2/4 for \u00afx\u226a1, andf(\u00afx)\u22431/\u00afx2for \u00afx\u226b1.\nUpon inserting Eq. (20) into the expressions for \u03banandknone obtains\n6\n\u03ba0=/radicalbig\n(a+\u01eba)f(\u00afx)/D (21)\nand\nk0=/radicalbig\n((a+\u01eba)(1\u2212f(\u00afx)))/D. (22)\nWhen \u00afx\u226a1, the \u201cpotential well\u201d is very deep, and one \ufb01nds the usual particle in a box result for \u0393 0(v), with\ncorrection term proportional to v2arising from the change of variables (9) and (11), namely\n\u03930(v)\u2243(v2\nc\u2212v2)/(4D) =a\u2212D\u03c02/W2\u2212v2/4D, (23)\nwith\nvc= 2D/radicalbig\n(a/D\u2212\u03c02/W2), (24)\n\u03ba0=/radicalbig\n(a+\u01eba)/D\u2212\u03c02/W2 (25)\nand\nk0=\u03c0/W. (26)\nFor \u00afx\u226b1 one \ufb01nds\n\u03930(v)\u2243(v2\nc\u2212v2)/(4D) = (a+\u01eba)2(W/2)2/D\u2212\u01eba\u2212D(v/2D)2(27)\nwith\nvc= 2D/radicalbig\n((a+\u01eba)W/2)2/D2\u2212\u01eba/D, (28)\n\u03ba0=/radicalbig\n(a+\u01eba)2(W/2)2/D2 (29)\nand\nk0=/radicalbig\n(a+\u01eba)(1\u22121/\u00afx2)/D. (30)\nIf we take as an e\ufb00ective di\ufb00usion constant for motile bacteria D= 6\u00b710\u22126cm2/sec, and a growth rate a= 10\u22123\n/sec in the oasis and a much smaller growth rate outside (0 <|\u01eb|<<1), we get for a W= 2cmdiameter oasis,\n\u00afx= 0.077\u226a1, and an \u201cextinction velocity\u201d vc\u22431.5\u00b5/sec, which is comparable to the Fisher wave velocity [5] in the\noasis,vF= 2\u221a\naD= 1.5\u00b5/sec.\nB. Finite Size E\ufb00ects and the Delocalization Transition\nAn experimental \ufb01nite system with periodic boundary conditions is de picted in \ufb01gure 1. The eigenvalue equation\nfor\u03ban(\u0393n) andkn(\u0393n) of the corresponding linearized problem of an oasis of width Win a \ufb01nite desert of extent\nL > W (withLbeing the mean circumference of the circular region in \ufb01gure 1), is ob tained using the Ansatz in\nEq. (9) with\n\u03c8n(x) =\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3(A1,nexp(\u03banx)+A2,nexp(\u2212\u03banx)),for\u2212L\n2<x<\u2212W\n2,\n(B1,nexp(iknx)+B2,nexp(\u2212iknx)),for\u2212W\n2<x<W\n2,\n(C1,nexp(\u03banx)+C2,nexp(\u2212\u03banx)),forW\n2<x<L\n2,(31)\nand matching \u03c6R,L\nn(x) andd\u03c6R,L\nn(x)/dxat the edges of the well and at the edges of the sample (imposing per iodic\nboundary conditions). One \ufb01nds the eigenvalue equation [12] (see a lso [19])\n2kn\u03ban(cosh(Lv/(2D))\u2212cos(knW)cosh(\u03ban(L\u2212W)))\n+(k2\nn\u2212\u03ba2\nn)sin(knW)sinh(\u03ban(L\u2212W)) = 0. (32)\n7\nForv/(2D)<Re{\u03ban}, and large L, equation (32) yields\nexp(L(v/(2D)\u2212\u03ban)) = (33)\ncos(knW)\u2212kn/(2\u03ban)\u00b7(1\u2212(\u03ban/kn)2)sin(knW).\nThe left hand side vanishes in the limit L\u2192 \u221e, and the equation reduces to the bound state equations of a single\nsquare well (Eq. (17) for even parity solutions and Eq. (19) for od d solutions). For \ufb01nite L, andv/2D<Re{\u03ban}, the\ndeviation of the \u201clocalized\u201d solutions \u03banandknfrom theirv= 0 values for small vis exponentially small in L [12].\nThese \u201clocalized\u201d or \u201cbound state\u201d solutions, are characterized b y an exponential decay of the bacterial density in\nthe desert with a correlation length\n\u03ben\u223c(Re{\u03ban}\u2212v/(2D))\u22121(34)\nand \u0393n(v) strictly real. However, \u201cdelocalized\u201dor\u201cscattering\u201dsolutionsals o exist, with \u0393 n(v) complex, and nontrivial\ndependence of \u03banandknonv, even in the limit of large L. As the velocity is increased, the nth localized eigenstate\nbecomes delocalized ( \u03ben\u2192 \u221e) at the critical delocalization velocity v\u2217\nngiven in an in\ufb01nite system by\nv\u2217\nn= 2DRe{\u03ban}. (35)\nThis implies\n\u03ben\u223c1/(v\u2217\nn\u2212v)\u03bd(36)\nwith the (universal) critical exponent \u03bd= 1. We saw that with increasing velocity, the growth rate Re{\u0393n(v)}for a\ngiven eigenstate decreases. It becomes negative above the corr esponding extinction velocity vnc. We therefore expect\nthat the delocalization transition for the \u201cground state\u201d (which te nds to dominate the long time behavior) can be\nobserved only if v\u2217\n0\u2264v0c. In the following we discuss the three desert scenarios, \u01eb>0,\u01eb<0, and\u01eb= 0.\n(1) For\u01eb >0 (a \u201cdeadly\u201d desert), of big enough size L, one \ufb01nds that all delocalized states die out exponentially\nwith time ( vnc< v\u2217\nn). The population is localized around the oasis at small vand extinct at high v. Figure 2 is a\nplot of the eigenvalues \u0393( v) in the complex plane for this case, as derived for the lattice model d iscussed in Appendix\nB. The lower part of \ufb01gure 4 shows a series of pro\ufb01les of the ground state eigenfunction close to the extinction\ntransition. In small enough systems, such that the total e\ufb00ectiv e growth rate/integraltextL\n0U(x)dxis positive, delocalized states\ncan actually have a positive growth rate even for \u01eb>0. (See also Eq. (A2) in Appendix A, with \u03b4\u03ba\u223cO(1/L), and\n\u00af\u03ba\u223cO(1/L) .) In this case, the system is small enough so that the bacteria can traverse the desert quickly, and on\naverage won\u2019t die before reenterring the oasis in a circular pipe.\n(2) If\u01eb<0, delocalized states should be observable even for very large syst ems, because the \u201cdesert\u201d can support\nmodest growth, although at a much smaller rate than in the oasis if |\u01eb| \u226a1. Growing delocalized eigenstates are\npresent, even for v= 0, and the population is a superposition of fast growing localized sta tes and more slowly growing\ndelocalized ones. As a drift velocity vincreases, the n\u2019th localized eigenstate delocalizes at v=v\u2217\nnwith a positive\ngrowthrate Re\u0393n(v\u2217\nn)(i.e.v\u2217\nn<vnc). This caseallowsforanexperimentalobservationofthe delocaliza tiontransition:\nas the velocity is increased, more and more eigenstates delocalize. T he eigenvalue spectrum for two di\ufb00erent values of\nvis shown in \ufb01gure 5 (a) and (b). We can see that the spectrum at the delocalization transition is slightly di\ufb00erent\ndepending on whether an \u201ceven\u201d eigenfunction or an \u201codd\u201d eigenfu nction is about to delocalize next (\u201ceven\u201d and\n\u201codd\u201d are to be understood in the sense explained in section IIA). I f an odd eigenfunction is about to delocalize\nnext, there exists a delocalized state which has a purely real growt h rate (at the tip of the parabola in the spectrum\nof \ufb01gure 5(b)), while no such state exists when an even eigenfunct ion is about to delocalize, as in \ufb01gure 5(a). The\nessential characteristics of the spectrum are derived in Appendix A.\nFor experiments, we focus on the delocalization of the ground stat e, since it is the fastest growing eigenstate, which\ndominates the system near the oasis. The ground state delocalizes at the highest delocalization velocity v=v\u2217\n0,\ni.e.forv > v\u2217\n0all states are delocalized. The lower part of \ufb01gure 6 shows a series o f pro\ufb01les of the ground state\neigenfunction close to delocalization. One sees that at the delocaliza tion velocity v\u2217\n0, the correlation length \u03be0reaches\nthe system size. In an in\ufb01nite system it diverges as in Eq. (36). Near the delocalization transition, we expect certain\nquantities to become independent of microscopic details of the syst em. These universal quantities will only depend on\ngeneral properties, such as symmetries, dimensions etc.. Simple mo dels that only share these general properties with\nthe experimental system will be su\ufb03cient for precise predictions fo r these quantities near the transition. An example\nof such a quantity is the critical exponent \u03bdin Eq. (36). Details for the square well system and more general ra ndom\nsystems will be presented in a future paper [14].\n(3) For\u01eb= 0, the growth rate of the bacteria exactly balances the death ra te in the desert, they only di\ufb00use. In this\ncase the delocalization velocity and the extinction velocities coincide: v\u2217\nn=vncin an in\ufb01nite system. There is again\n8\na diverging correlation length leading to universal critical behavior n ear the delocalization transition [14]. In a \ufb01nite\nsystem the average growth rate/integraltextL\n0dxU(x)/Lis positive. In small systems, one therefore expects to see deloca lized\nstates with a positive growth rate in experiments for this case as we ll.\nThese results for one dimension in the limit L\u2192 \u221eare summarized in \ufb01gure 3 which shows a schematic phase\ndiagram for \ufb01xed well depth U0\u2261(a+\u01eba), as a function of the convection velocity and the average growth rate\n/an}b\u2207acketle{tU/an}b\u2207acket\u2207i}ht \u2261/integraltextL\n0dxU(x)/L, in the limit L\u2192 \u221e.\n-2.5 -2.0 -1.5 -1.0 -0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.50.00.20.40.60.81.0c(x,v)/c(0,0)Bacterial Density near Extinction\nNonlinear Case\n-2.5 -2.0 -1.5 -1.0 -0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5\nx/W0.00.20.40.60.81.0c(x,v)/c(0,0)Linear Casev/vF =00.93\n0.98\n0.99\n0.93\n0.98\n0.99v/vF =0\nFIG. 4.

Curves for the\n\u201clinear\u201d case, were computed as in \ufb01gure 4. The pro\ufb01les were e xtracted from a lattice model with 1000 sites, an oasis of wid th\n200 sites, with growth rate U= 0.1 inside the oasis and U= 1.1 outside, and large di\ufb00usion constant D= 300. The velocity\nparameters v/vFare taken to be v/vF= 0 (solid line), 0 .17 (dotted), 0 .33 (dashed), 0 .50 (long-dashed), and 0 .83 (dash-dotted).\nIn both cases the population becomes delocalized at high vel ocities with increasing velocity when the correlation leng th reaches\nthe size of the system.\nC. Delta-Function Potential Well\nResults for a delta-function-like oasis in one dimension, can be easily d erived as a special case of the square well\npotential, by taking the limit \u01eb\u21920,a\u2192 \u221eandW\u21920 withaW= const\u2261V0. In this case Eq. (32) simpli\ufb01es to\n\u03ba(cosh(Lv/(2D))\u2212cosh(\u03baL))+V0sinh(\u03baL)/D= 0, (37)\nwhich is the same equation as obtained in [12]. With the identi\ufb01cation \u03ba\u2261(\u2212i)Kthe results derived there can be\napplied here: the delocalization picture is the same as in \ufb01gure 5(a), e xcept that there exists only one (even parity)\nbound state solution for Re{\u03ba}>v/(2D). Again two critical velocities vc0andv\u2217\n0emerge, in accordance to the above\ndiscussion for a square well potential.\nIII. EFFECTS OF THE NONLINEARITY\nWe can also estimate the e\ufb00ects due to the nonlinear term in equation (1), which leads to a saturation of c(x,t) for\n\u0393n(v)>0. The equation of motion becomes\n\u2202c(x,t)/\u2202t=Lc(x,t)\u2212bc2(x,t), (38)\nwithLgiven by Eq. (4). (The coe\ufb03cient bcan be set to 1 by rescaling the density c(x,t) byb, as in Appendix C.)\nThe solution can be expressed in terms of the complete set of right e igenstates for the linear problem with new time\ndependent coe\ufb03cients cn(t) with\n11\nc(x,t) =/summationdisplay\nncn(t)\u03c6R\nn(x) (39)\nand\ndcn(t)/dt= \u0393ncn(t)\u2212/summationdisplay\nm,m\u2032wn,mm\u2032cm(t)cm\u2032(t), (40)\nwhere the mode couplings are given by [7]\nwn,mm\u2032=b/integraldisplay\ndx\u03c6L\nn(x)\u03c6R\nm(x)\u03c6R\nm\u2032(x). (41)\nIn general one expects that through the mode couplings the fast est growing eigenstate suppresses the growth rate of\nthe other eigenstates, provided the corresponding couplings are large enough [7,14]. In the mixed phase of \ufb01gure 3 we\nexpect that the fastest growing bound state suppresses the ot her bound states, and the fastest growing delocalized\nstate suppresses the other delocalized states [14].\nA. E\ufb00ects of the Nonlinearity at the Extinction Transition\nFor\u01eb >0 (and large enough systems so that/integraltextL\n0dxU(x)<0), with velocity vjust below the extinction velocity\nv0c, we expect that the growing ground state term c0(t)\u03c6R\n0(x) dominates the summation (39) for c(x,t). In a \ufb01rst\napproximation we neglect all cm(t) withm>0 and \ufb01nd\ndc0(t)/dt= \u03930c0(t)\u2212w0c2\n0(t), (42)\nwithw0\u2261w0,00=b/integraltext\nddx\u03c6L\n0(x)(\u03c6R\n0(x))2>0. At long times\nc0(t) =c0(0)exp(\u03930t)\n1+c0(0)(exp(\u0393 0t)\u22121)w0/\u03930(43)\nwith asymptotic behavior lim t\u2192\u221ec0(t) = \u03930/w0.

One can\nsee that close to the extinction transition the ground state of the linearized growth is an excellent approximation, as\nis to be expected since there the bacterial density c(x) becomes small, so that mode couplings other than w0induced\nby the nonlinear term bc2(x) become small relative to the linear terms.\n0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0\nv/vF0.00.20.40.60.81.0N0(v)/N0(0)Total population versus drift velocity\n(Extinction transition)\nFIG. 7.

E\ufb00ects of the Nonlinearity at the Delocalization Transit ion\nFigure 6 shows the same information as \ufb01gure 4 for the delocalization transition for an oasis in a background with\npositive growth rate. One can see that the linear approximation ( i.e.taking the ground state of the linear problem as\na solution for the steady state), becomes best for high velocities [1 4], when the drift term in the equation of motion\nbecomes dominant compared to the nonlinear term. Furthermore t he nonlinear solution at low velocities is in the\n\u201cmixed phase\u201d, i.e., it is a superposition of extended and localized eigenstates of the sy stem. A decomposition of\n13\nthev= 0 nonlinear solution into the eigenstates of the system shows [14] t hat its leading contributions are from\nthe localized ground state eigenfunction and the fastest growing d elocalized eigenfunction. As the drift velocity is\nincreased, the contribution of localized eigenstates clearly diminishe s. Above the delocalization transition, the steady\nstate is composed only of delocalized modes.\nIV. TWO DIMENSIONS, INFINITE SYSTEM SIZE\nMuch of the above analysis can be adapted to two dimensions. We aga in use the transformation (9) and consider\na circular oasis of diameter Win Eq. (10). The analysis is straightforward, so we omit most of the d etails. Following\nreference [12], the qualitative behavior of non-Hermitian eigenvalue spectra for linearized growth in two dimensions\nshouldbe asfollows: Asin onedimension, localizedstatesassociatedw iththe potentialwellwillliein apointspectrum\non the real axis. Extended states, however, will occupy a dense r egion in the complex plane with a parabolic boundary\n(see \ufb01gure 8). With increasing v, the localized point spectrum will again migrate into the continuum.\nRe\u0393nnIm\u0393\nFIG. 8. Sketch of a complex nonhermitian eigenvalue spectru m in two dimensions with localized and delocalized eigensta tes.\nThe sketch uses a computation of the spectrum for a delta func tion potential in two dimensions [12], in which case there is only\none bound state (to the right of the imaginary axis). We expec t qualitatively the same result for the \ufb01nite two dimensiona l\nwell discussed in the text, except that multiple bound state s with real eigenvalues will occur, just as in one dimension.\nIn the localized regime the spatial distribution of bacteria is in the linea r approximation given by the convection-\ndistorted ground state eigenfunction,\n\u03c6R,L\n0(x) =\uf8f1\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f3C1,0exp(\u00b1v\u00b7x/2D)J0(kn|x|),for|x|<W/2,\nC2,0exp(\u00b1v\u00b7x/2D)K0(\u03ban|x|),for|x|>W/2,(49)\nwhereJ0(x) andK0(x) are Bessel functions of order zero [20]. The constants C1,0andC2,0are chosen such that\n\u03c6R,L\n0(x) and its radial derivative are continuous at |x|=W/2. The lowest energy eigenvalue is again given by eq. (20),\nbut with di\ufb00erent results for f(\u00afx) [16]: for \u00afx\u226a1 one \ufb01nds f(\u00afx)\u22431\u2212a2\n1\u00afx2wherea1\u22432.405 is the \ufb01rst zero of J0(a);\nfor \u00afx\u226b1 one \ufb01nds f(\u00afx)\u2243\u00afx2exp(\u22124\u00afx2). The behavior of the ground state eigenvalue is thus\n\u03930\u2243a\u22124D(2.405)2/W2\u2212Dv2/(4D) (50)\nfor \u00afx\u226a1 and\n14\n\u03930\u2243D(4/W2)exp[\u221216D/(W2(a+\u01eba))]\u2212D(v/2D)2(51)\nfor \u00afx\u226b1.

Although the full nonlin ear two dimensional problem\nseems tractable numerically, we expect that close to the extinction transition the curves for the linearized case will\napproximate the shape of the steady state, because the ground state dominates sums like that in equation (39).\n-1 -0.5 0 0.5 1-1-0.500.51\nFIG. 9.

There are two constraints on the mesh size or lattice spacing \u21130, which ensure that the model correctly describes\nthe continuum limit for a given eigenstate \u03c6R\nn, derived from the condition that \u21130|\u2207\u03c6R\nn(x)|/\u03c6R\nn(x)\u226a1. For small v\none requires\nkn\u21130\u226a1 and\u03ban\u21130\u226a1. (B1)\nFor high velocities the condition becomes\nv\u21130/(2D)\u226a1, (B2)\nas follows from Eq. (9). The lattice simulations shown in this paper are well within these limits.\nAPPENDIX C: DIMENSIONLESS QUANTITIES\nThe equation of motion can be rewritten in dimensionless form, by intr oducing rescaled coordinates, y\u2261x/W,\nwhereWis the width Wof the oasis, and rescaled population densities \u00af c\u2261c/cs, wherecsis roughly the saturation\nvalue of the bacterial density in the oasis (up to O(\u01eb)):cs=a/b(see Eq.

In an SIRS\nepidemiological model, we divide the population into three groups, Sus ceptibles, Infec-\ntives and Removeds, and the problem is to examine the behavior of th e size of each group\nwhen the time goes to in\ufb01nity. They considered a disease with horizon al transmission,\nthat is a disease which is transmitted by contact between an infectiv e and a susceptible\nindividual. We intend to generalize their results for a vertically transm itted disease, that\nis a disease which is also transmitted from infective parents to their n ewborns. The as-\nsumption of vertical transmission has two consequences. First it c auses some newborns\n1\nto die and forces us to assume that the birth rate di\ufb00ers from one g roup to another. (See\nthe demographic assumption in [3, 9, 10].) The second fact is that som e newborns are\ninfected, hence a group of newborns enter to the infective class [1 , 2, 6]. We also assume\nthat a part of these infected newborns are known and removed af ter their birth. We shall\nshow that the latter parameter can play an important role in the epid emic process.\nWe consider an SIRS epidemiological model for a vertically transmitte d disease. In\nour model, the incidence function is of proportionate mixing type intr oduced by Nold\n[11]. Natural births and deaths are assumed to be proportional to the class numbers with\ndi\ufb00erent rates. We also assume that a proportion of the infected n ewborns are known and\nremoved. We follow [4] to examine our model equation which is homogen eous of degree\none. We consider the proportions system and show that this syste m has no periodic\norbit in its feasibility region. This reduces our analysis to the discussio n of existence and\nstability of rest points of a palnar system. The technique used here to show the uniquness\nof endemic equilibria is based on the Poincar\u00b4 e index. This technique ha s no hard analysis\nand can be easily applied to other similar systems [13, 14]. The reader c an verify that\nour results hold for similar SIRI systems as well [7].\nWe \ufb01rst in the next section state the model and a result concerning the non-existence\nof certain types of solutions [5]. We consider the proportions syste m and prove that every\nsolution in the feasibility region tends to a rest point of this system. I n Section 3., we\nintroduce a quadratic planar system with the same dynamics as the p roportions system\nand then we discuss the existence and stability of rest points of this quadratic planar\nsystem. This gives a complete global analysis of the proportions sys tem which is used to\nprovide a global analysis of the original system is Section 4.\n2 The model\nIn order to derive our model equations, we divide the population into three classes, the\nsusceptible, the infective and the removed individuals with total num bersS,IandR\nrespectively,. We set N=S+I+Rwhich is the total size of the population. The\nfollowing parameters are used in our model equations:\nb0: per capita birth rate of susceptible individuals,\n2\nb1: per capita birth rate of infective individuals born uninfected,\n\u03b2: per capita birth rate of infective individuals born infected,\nb2: per capita birth rate of removed individuals,\nd: per capita disease free death rate,\n\u03b51: excess per capita death rate of infected individuals,\n\u03b52: excess per capita death rate of removed individuals,\n\u03b1: per capita removal rate of infective individuals,\n\u03b3: per capita recovery rate of removed individuals,\n\u03bb: e\ufb00ective per capita contact rate of infective individuals.\nAs mentioned before, we assume that the infected newborns ente r the classes IandR\nof proportions \u03b21and\u03b22respectively, hence \u03b2=\u03b21+\u03b22. In this paper, all the above\nparameters, are positive, however some of them can also be zero. These hypotheses yield\nthe following system of di\ufb00erential equation in R+\n3, where \u201c\u2032\u201d denotes the derivatives\nwith respect to t, the time.\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3S\u2032= (b0\u2212d)S+b1I+(b2+\u03b3)R\u2212\u03bbIS\nN(2\u22121)\nI\u2032= (\u03b21\u2212d\u2212\u03b51\u2212\u03b1)I+\u03bbIS\nN(2\u22122)\nR\u2032= (\u03b22+\u03b1)I\u2212(d+\u03b52+\u03b3)R (2\u22123)\nwhere\u03bbIS\nNis of the proportionate or random mixing type [8, 11]. By adding the ab ove\nthree equations, the total population equation is\nN=b0S+(b1+\u03b2\u2212\u03b51)I+(b2\u2212\u03b52)R\u2212dN.\nIf we consider the proportions s=S\nN,i=I\nN,r=R\nN, we get the following system of\nequations.\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3s\u2032=b0s+b1i+(b2+\u03b3)r\u2212b0s2\u2212(b1+\u03b2+\u03bb\u2212\u03b51)is\u2212(b2\u2212\u03b52)sr(2\u22121)\u2032\ni\u2032= (\u03b21\u2212\u03b51\u2212\u03b1)i+(\u03bb\u2212b0)is\u2212(b1+\u03b2\u2212\u03b51)i2\u2212(b2\u2212\u03b52)ir (2\u22122)\u2032\nr\u2032= (\u03b22+\u03b1)i\u2212(\u03b52+\u03b3)r\u2212b0sr\u2212(b1+\u03b2\u2212\u03b51)ir\u2212(b2\u2212\u03b52)r2(2\u22123)\u2032\n3\nThis system is called proportions system and the feasibility region of t his system is the\ntriangle\nD={(s,i,r)|s\u22650,i\u22650,r\u22650,s+i+r= 1}.\nIf we set \u03a3 = s+i+rthen \u03a3\u2032= (1\u2212\u03a3)(b0s+(b1+\u03b2\u2212\u03b51)i+(b2\u2212\u03b52)r). Thus the plane\n\u03a3 = 1 is invariant. Moreover, on the sides of D, we have:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3s= 0\u21d2s\u2032=b1i+(b2+\u03b3)r\u22650,\ni= 0\u21d2i\u2032= 0 hence the line {i= 0}is invariant ,\nr= 0\u21d2r\u2032= (\u03b22+\u03b1)i.\nTherefore, Dis positively invariant. On the invariant line {\u03a3 = 1}\u2229{i= 0}, we have\nr\u2032=\u2212(\u03b52+\u03b3)r\u2212b0r(1\u2212r)\u2212(b2\u2212\u03b52)r2=\u2212(b0+\u03b52+\u03b3)r+(b0\u2212b2+\u03b52)r2.\nIt follows that this invariant line contains two rest points, the Diseas e-Free Equilibrium\n(1,0,0) and possibly another one which is outside of D. It is easy to see tha t the DFE\nattracts the side D\u2229{i= 0}. Furthermore, our vector \ufb01eld is strictly inward on the other\nsides ofD. Thus\u25e6\nD, the interior of D, is positively invariant too. The following theorem\nreduces our problem to the discussion of existence and stability of r est points in D.\nTheorem 2.1. The\u03c9-limit set of any solution for the system (2 \u22121)\u2032\u2212(2\u22123)\u2032with\ninitial point in Dis a rest point in D.\nProof. SinceDis compact and positively invariant, the \u03c9-limit set of any solution with\ninitial point in Dis a compact nonempty invariant subset of D. Here we use the Poincar\u00b4 e-\nBendixon theorem and the terminology used to prove it [12]. In the ne xt section, we will\nsee that this system has at most three rest points in D. Thus it satis\ufb01es the assumptions\nof Poincar\u00b4 e-Bendixon theorem.

One of these rest points is the origin\nwhich comes from the DFE.

Now we de\ufb01ne the \ufb01rst\nthreshold parameter R0=\u03bb+\u03b21\nb0+\u03b51+\u03b1which governs the stability of the origin.\nTheorem 3.1. The origin is globally asymptotically stable in the feasibility region D1\nwhenR0\u22641 and it is a saddle point when R0>1.\nProof. By Theorem 2.1. it is enough to prove that if R0\u22641, then the origin is the only\nrest point in D1. If there exists a rest point in\u25e6\nD1, we have i\u2032= 0 andi/ne}ationslash= 0 at this point.\nThus it belongs to the line\n(\u03bb+\u03b21\u2212b0\u2212\u03b51\u2212\u03b1)+(b0+\u03b51\u2212\u03bb\u2212b1\u2212\u03b2)i+(b0+\u03b52\u2212\u03bb\u2212b2)r= 0.(3\u22123)\nSinces\u2032= 0 at this point, from (2 \u22121)\u2032we obtain\nb0s+b1i+(b2+\u03b3)r\u2212b0s2\u2212(b1+\u03b2+\u03bb\u2212\u03b51)is\u2212(b2\u2212\u03b52)sr= 0.\nand by using the relation s+i+r= 1, we can write\nb1i+(b2+\u03b3)r+(b0+\u03b51\u2212b1\u2212\u03b2\u2212\u03bb)is+(b0+\u03b52\u2212b2)sr= 0.\nMultiplying (3-3) by ( \u2212s) and adding it to the above expression, we get the following\nequality\nb1i+(b2+\u03b3)r+\u03bbsr+(b0+\u03b51+\u03b1\u2212\u03bb\u2212\u03b21)s= 0.\nBut the left hand side is positive when R0\u22641 and this is a contradiction. /square\nWhenR0>1, the origin is a saddle point and it does not attract any point of\nD1\u2212{i= 0}. Thus the orbits with initial point in D1\u2212 {i= 0}must be attracted by\n6\nsome rest points in\u25e6\nD1by Theorem 2.1. These rest points belong to the line (3-3) and\nthe conic section\nr\u2032= (\u03b22+\u03b1)i\u2212(b0+\u03b52+\u03b3)r+(b0+\u03b51\u2212b1\u2212\u03b2)ir+(b0+\u03b52\u2212b2)r2= 0.\nIt follows that there are at most two rest points in\u25e6\nD1.

Here we will make some comparison between the result in [4]\nand the above results.\n1. If we set b0=b1=b2=band\u03b21=\u03b22=\u03b2= 0 in the system (2-1)-(2-3), we obtain\nthe system (2-1)-(2-3) in [4].

Comparing their threshold parameters with our ones, we see tha t the e\ufb00ect of\nb0,b1andb2appears more clearly instead of b. For example when R0>1, ourR1is\nb0s\u2217+(b1+\u03b2)i\u2217+b2r\u2217\nd+\u03b51i\u2217+\u03b52r\u2217, but they obtain R1=b\nd+\u03b51i\u2217+\u03b52r\u2217in which the e\ufb00ects of b0,b1andb2are\nhidden in b.\n3. There are two vertical transmission parameter, \u03b21and\u03b21, in our model. The e\ufb00ect\nof\u03b21inR0andR2is crucial. Since \u03b21+\u03b22=\u03b2, we can decrease \u03b21by increasing \u03b22.\nTherefore removing more infected newborns causes more safe sit uation.\nAcknowledgments.

A\ncellular automaton, de\ufb01nedinshape-space, wasrecentlysh owntoexhibitself-regulation andcomplex\nbehavior and is, therefore, a good candidate to model the imm une system. Using this model to\nsimulate a real immune system we \ufb01nd good agreement with rece nt experiments on mice. The\nmodel exhibitstheexperimentallyobservedrefractory beh avioroftheimmunesystemundermultiple\nantigen presentations as well as loss of its plasticity caus ed by aging.\nPACS: 02.70Lq,05.45+b,87.10+e,87.22\nThe special capability of the immune system is pat-\ntern recognition and its assignment is to patrol the body\nand guard its identity. The main cells responsible for the\nimmune response against any attack by antigens (virus,\npoison, etc.) are the white blood cells called lympho-\ncytes. Each lymphocyte carries on its surface the order\nof105molecularreceptorsandthe immune systemis able\nto produce the order of 1011di\ufb00erent types of molecular\nreceptors. Oneofthe mainclassesoflymphocytesarethe\nBcellswhichproduceantibodieswiththesamemolecular\nshape as those of its molecular receptors. Each molecu-\nlar receptor (or antibody) is able to recognize and to be\nrecognized. This immune recognition can lead either to a\npositive response, which generates cell proliferation, cell\nactivation and antibody secretion, or to a negative one\nthat results in tolerance or suppression.\nIn1974NielsKayJerne1proposedatheorywhichcom-\npares the immune system to a self-regulated multicon-\nnected functional network. This functionally connected\nnetwork, generated by the (lock-key) interactions among\nthe elements of the immune system, is self-regulated by\nthe dynamics of activation and suppression; some pop-\nulations decay and new ones grow, but there is no per-\ncolation of the information through the entire immune\nsystem. The immune memory may be a consequence\nof network interactions. Some experiments2,3suggest\nthat only20%ofthe lymphocytesareconnected, whereas\ntheir majority are small resting cells, able to respond to\nany antigen.\nWe have simulated recently4a modi\ufb01ed version5of\na cellular automaton model proposed by Stau\ufb00er and\nWeisbuch6, which, in turn, was based on one introduced\nby De Boer, Segel and Perelson7. Although the previ-\nous studies have shown that this model can exhibit sta-\nble and chaotic behaviors, none of them are interesting\nfrom the immunological point of view. Our simulations\nhave demonstrated that in the transition region, between\nthose behaviors, we obtain a multiconnected functionalnetwork whose emergent properties reproduces many of\nthe properties of the temporal evolution of the immune\nrepertoire4.\nThe elements of the automaton are associated with\npoints in shape-space8. Each point on a d-dimensional\nspace corresponds to the shape of a molecule (associ-\nated with a B cell receptor or antibody). Every one of\nthedcoordinates describes one of many factors involved\nin the immune pattern recognition, such as geometrical\nshape, electric charge, hydrophobicity etc. To each site\niwe associate an automaton of three states, represent-\ning the population (concentration) of the corresponding\nreceptor: low - or non-activated ( Bi= 0), intermediate\n(Bi= 1) and high - or excited ( Bi= 2). Site iin-\nteracts with 2 d+ 1 sites: its mirror image \u2212iand the\nnearest neighbors of the mirror image (representing im-\nperfect lock-key interactions). For each site we de\ufb01ne a\n\ufb01eldhithat represents the concentrations of complemen-\ntary receptors,\nhi=/summationdisplay\nj(i)Bj(i) (1)\nwhere the sum runs over the 2 d+1 sites j(i) that in\ufb02u-\nencethesite i. Theupdateruleoftheautomatonisbased\non a dose response function which describes the receptor\ncrosslinking involved in B cell activation5\u20137. There is\na minimal dose ( \u03b81) of antigen/or antibody excitation\nthat elicits the speci\ufb01c response, but for a high dose of\nexcitation (greater than \u03b82) the response decreases (sup-\npression). The rule is\nBi(t+1) =/braceleftbigg\nBi(t)+1 if \u03b81\u2264hi(t)\u2264\u03b82\nBi(t)\u22121 otherwise(2)\nbut no change is made if it would lead to Bi=\u22121 or\nBi= 3.\nThis model exhibits a transition from stable to chaotic\nregimes for d\u226525, depending on the activation thresh-\nold (\u03b81) and the width of the activation interval of the\n1\nwindow ( \u03b82\u2212\u03b81). In the stable region the system always\nevolves to \ufb01xed points or short limit cycles, with very\nlow percentage of activated sites, whereas in the chaotic\nregion most sites are excited, corresponding to a non-\nhealthy state. None of these behaviors corresponds to\nthe dynamical picture of the functional connected net-\nwork suggested by Jerne. In the transition region (whose\nlocation depends on d5) we did observe, however, emer-\ngent complex behavior which is appropriate to describe\na self-regulated multiconnected network4. We have also\nshown that memory comes from the dynamics of the sys-\ntem and can be described as the ability of the system to\nadapt to changes provoked by excitations (antigen pre-\nsentations).\nWe use this model to simulate the main features ob-\nserved in some recent experiments concerning immuniza-\ntion and the e\ufb00ects of aging on the immune response of\nmice9\u201311. Since until now there is only limited evidence\nsupportingtheexistenceoftheimmunenetwork2,3butno\nconclusive proof, our simulations may provide the much\nneeded connections between the available experimental\nresults and the Jerne theory.\nVerdolin9subjected young (8 weeks old) mice to a \ufb01rst\nimmunization, and 14 days afterwards to 9 consecutive\nimmunizations with intervals of one week between them.\nThe speci\ufb01c antibodies are measured 7 days after each\nantigen presentation. The protocol used for immuniza-\ntion consist of intraperitoneal injection (boosters) of a\nspeci\ufb01c antigen (OVA). Verdolin\u2019s results (for a group\nof 6 mice) show (see Fig 1) the speci\ufb01c antibody counts\nas a function of the presentation with all doses counted\nrelative to the \ufb01rst immunization response. The results\nshow a fast increase from the \ufb01rst to the fourth presenta-\ntion with a consecutive saturation of the response. This\nis interpreted from the immunological point of view as a\nrefractory behavior of the immune system, meaning that\nafter few presentations there is a saturation of the level\nof antibody counts, a fact that can not be explained only\nby clonal selection theory for the immune system.\nThe second experiment we discuss in this paper con-\ncerns the e\ufb00ects of aging on the immune responsiveness.\nAccording to the results obtained by Lahmann et al.10\nand, later, by Faria et al.11for young (8 weeks) and\nold (25 weeks) mice, after the \ufb01rst immunization the re-\nsponse of the young mice achieves much higher levels (in\nthe antibody counts) than the response generated by the\nold ones, indicating some rigidity of the system, acquired\nduring the aging process. In other words, there is a loss\nof responsiveness (see the insert of Fig 1).\nWe set out to test whether the model (1-2) is able to\nreproduce the experimental \ufb01ndings, of saturation and\naging described above. We used the following initial dis-\ntribution for the Bvariables: (1 \u2212x) ofB= 0, and1\n2x\nofB= 1 and 2. All our simulations were performed\nat the transition region for a three-dimensional lattice\nwithL= 50; the results are qualitatively the same as\nthose obtained with L= 100 and for higher dimensions4.\nWe chose x= 0.26 and used the activation interval ac-cording to our previous studies. In order to study the\ne\ufb00ects of a given antigen presentation we proceed as fol-\nlows: a system, prepared as described above, was allowed\nto evolve according to the rules (1-2); this was used as\nour \u201dcontrol\u201d group. In a replica of the same initial sys-\ntem the antigen presentation is simulated by introducing\n\u201ddamage\u201d12: randomly chosen regions of receptor pop-\nulations in the B= 0 state were \ufb02ipped to the acti-\nvated state( B= 2)4. This \ufb02ip simulates the exposure\nto antigen indirectly, by the activation or the increase of\nthe concentration of speci\ufb01c clones (receptors) that are\nable to recognize this antigen. The evolution of the con-\ntrol system and the damaged copy was then compared\nby measuring the Hamming distance between them, to\nstudy the e\ufb00ects of the antigen presentation. In the case\nof one or two antigen presentations4the results indicate\nthat under perturbation the multiconnected network ex-\npands and relaxes in few time steps, following an aggre-\ngation/disaggregationdynamicswhichadaptsthesystem\nto the new conditions, including some sites of the dam-\naged regions in the next con\ufb01guration of the functional\nnetwork.\nIn this work we discarded in all simulations the ini-\ntial 1000 Monte Carlo Steps (MCS)- a step consists of\none update of all sites. At this point( considered to be\nequivalent to the \u201dbirth\u201dof the immune system) we start\nto produce at random antigen presentations of di\ufb00erent\ntypes and sizes, with di\ufb00erent, randomly chosen time in-\ntervals between them. This introduced noise simulates a\nreal immune system exposed to many antigens, present\nin the environment in which the system lives and is in-\ngested in food, etc. We adopted the arbitrary time scale\nof 5 MCS corresponding to one day. The noise discussed\nabove was generated by small damages produced at ran-\ndom: the time interval between two consecutive anti-\ngen presentations can vary from 1 to 100 MCS (1 \u221220\ndays); each antigen presentation can correspond to 1,\n2 or 3 damages introduced at di\ufb00erent regions of non-\nactivated populations. These regions may have di\ufb00erent\nsizes, varying from 1 to 3 (onion-like) concentric layers\n(containing 7, 25 and 63 sites respectively) around a cen-\ntral site. The control system and the replica that sim-\nulates the immunization process (multiple antigen pre-\nsentations) were subjected to the same noise, during the\nentire simulation. The immunization protocol was simu-\nlated by damaging 6 layers around a speci\ufb01c site at \ufb01xed\ntime intervals of one week (35 MCS), corresponding to\nthe peritoneal injection. This high-dose antigen presen-\ntation clearly di\ufb00erentiates the speci\ufb01c antigen presen-\ntation from the noise. We performed these sequences of\nhigh dose antigen presentations starting at two di\ufb00erent\ntimes, corresponding to two di\ufb00erent ages, 8 weeks (280\nMCS) and 25 weeks (875 MCS), in order to study the\ne\ufb00ects of aging on the immune responsiveness.\nIn \ufb01gure 2 we show the results obtained for a sequence\nof antigen presentations. For each case (di\ufb00erent age)\nour results are averagedover 10 statistically independent\nsamples corresponding to 10 randomly uncorrelated ini-\n2\ntial con\ufb01gurations (and di\ufb00erent noise).\nThe speci\ufb01c antibodies counts in the experiments are\ncompared in our simulations to the number of di\ufb00erent\nexcited populations involved in the response, which is\nmeasured by the time evolution of the total Hamming\ndistance between the \u201ccontrol\u201d and the excited replica.\nWe obtained the same qualitative behavior as the real\nimmune systems shown in \ufb01gure 1. After few presenta-\ntions the responsessaturate, showingthe samerefractory\nbehavior as seen in the experiments. Since in the experi-\nments the speci\ufb01c response wasmeasured (corresponding\nto the antigen that was used), we have also considered,\nin our simulations, the speci\ufb01c response. To this end\nwe measured the changes on the clones belonging to the\ndamaged region (DR) and its mirror image (M). Satura-\ntion is seen alsoin these regions, as shownin Fig 3, which\npresents the speci\ufb01c changes in DR, M and the total HD\nfor a single sample (the same behavior was observed in\nall samples).\nThe learning process that may occur in the immune\nnetwork, due to the antigen introduction, results in local\nchanges of the activated clones con\ufb01gurations, and mem-\nory is due to the attainment of a new steady state after\nthe antigen challenge disappears. The learning process\nthat may occur due to multiple antigen presentations,\nleads to the saturation behavior: after a few antigen pre-\nsentationsthesystemlearnshowtocontroltheexcitation\nprovoked by this antigen and does not need to improve\nthe response anymore. This interpretation is supported\nby other studies performed for high-dose antigen presen-\ntations without noise, that will be published elsewhere.\nBy observing the evolution of the excited sites in the\nDR and M regions, we saw that after each presentation\nmore sites are included in the functional network. After\nthat, the response will stay the same. The multiple anti-\ngen presentation, lead to the saturation of the number of\nnew sites incorporated in those regionsand after that the\nsystem will always give the same response to this kind of\nantigen. The aggregation/disaggregationprocesses guar-\nantee that the subsequent con\ufb01gurations of the network,\narrived at after each antigen presentation, include the\nnecessary information about the damage introduced, but\nstill keep only 10 \u221220% of the sites excited, in agreement\nwith the experimental results.\nThis conclusion is also reinforced by the observation\nthat, the level of saturation and also the time necessary\nfor the system achieve the saturated state will depend on\nthe size and number of damages which simulate the anti-\ngen presentation. We have performed the same kind of\nsimulation (immunization procedures) for di\ufb00erent sizes\nof the damages; for small damages (4 layers) the system\nsaturatesfasterthanforbigones(6layers),sinceitlearns\nfaster about the small damaged regions.\nThe data shown in the insert of \ufb01gure 2 corresponds to\nthe saturation values of the Hamming distance di\ufb00erence\nbetween \u201ccontrol\u201d and replica as measured for the two\ndi\ufb00erent ages (8 and 25 weeks). From those results we\nconclude that the \u201colder\u201d the system is, the more rapidlyit saturates and the less intense is its response. The older\nsystem has been exposed to a larger number of di\ufb00erent\nantigens, thus more regions have already been excited,\nmore information has been added to the functional net-\nwork and the system is more rigid to accept new local\nchanges. Old systems saturate faster than young ones,\nsince less changes are accepted in their dynamics. The\nrigidity of the system, which increases with age, can be\ninterpreted from the network point of view as a loss of\nits plasticity. The younger the system the greater its\nplasticity.\nIn this work we have shown that the multiconnected\nfunctional network obtained in the critical region of a\nsimple cellular automaton model can describe the behav-\nior of a real immune system. The emergent properties of\nthe cooperative behavior found in our simulations are in\ngood agreement with the experimental results exhibited\nby mice in experiments of immunization and aging. Our\nresults indicate that the Jerne theory as implemented\nin this model could explain these experimental observa-\ntions and possibly provide the much needed connection\nbetween this theory and the available experiments. The\nimmunization process and the saturation (refractory be-\nhavior) observed in the antibody counts are interpreted\nwithin the network point of view as the learning process\nof the immune system and the aging e\ufb00ects are inter-\npreted as the loss of ability to produce new local changes\nor the loss of plasticity. This work also give support to\nmany conjectures which suggest that the emergent prop-\nerties exhibited by complex automata, resulting from a\ndynamical behavior involving adaptive mechanisms are\nvery appropriated to describe biological systems.

Introduction\nPhenomenological studies of lipid bilayer membranes have b ecome imperative,\nfor a large amount of experiments reveal that the matrix of bi omembrane plays an\nimportant role in some non-linear phenomena such as shape \ufb02u ctuations of cells\nand oscillations of the membrane potential in an external el ectric \ufb01eld (1-3). In\napproaching the problem, however, one isimmediately confr onted withcomplexities\nbecause of the concurrence of the elastic-viscous motion an d the change in shape of\nthe material. The lack of a theoretical framework tailored f or non-Newtonian \ufb02uid\nmembranes impedes progress in this research area, though th e general geometrical\nmethod in continuum mechanics has been well established. Th e purpose of this\npaper is to present such a framework.\nThemembranesconstitutedbytwolayersofrod-shapedmolec ulesareidenti\ufb01ed\nwith hydrotropic liquid crystals in the laminar phase. From this point of view, one\nassumes in the present paper that the dynamic theory of liqui d crystals developed\nduring the last 30 years is applicable to the membranes. In fa ct, the experimental\nobservationsmentionedabovewouldnotbesurprisingifone thinksoftheanisotropy\nfeature of the material, which, as is well known, leads to ins tabilities in the liquid\ncrystal bulk.\nDue to the pioneering research of Oseen [4], the fundamental contribution of\nFrank [5] and the important supplementary work of Nehring an d Saupe [6], a cur-\nvature elasticity theory of liquid crystals has been establ ished. It is essentially\na phenomenological theory. A dimensionless unit vector nam ed \u201cdirector\u201d is de-\n\ufb01ned to indicate the preferred orientation of the molecules . The energy stored in\nthe material during elastic deformation is thus expressed i n terms of this vector.\nExtending the theory to thin \ufb01lms in particular yields the we ll-known curvature\nelasticity equation of membranes [7] which has been used in f ruitful studies on the\nhydrostatic form of lipid vesicles [8].\nThe dynamic theory of liquid crystals [9-13], mainly uniaxi al crystals, stems\nfrom such a mechanical base. It assumes rotation of the molec ules, indicated by the\ndirector, superposed on the mean \ufb02ow of the molecules themse lves. The theory was\nused to investigate instabilities of liquid crystals and ha s interpreted successfully\nthe Williams\u2019 domain structure and the homoetropic texture s as well in nematics\n[14-22].\nOne adapts the theory to the particular context by neglectin g non-uniformities\nacross the membrane thickness and replacing the three-dime nsional \ufb01lm by a two-\ndimensional surface. It is exactly the method used in the the ory of thin shells\n[23]. The simpli\ufb01cation is acceptable in most cases of bioce lls, for the membrane\nthickness (40-80 \u02daA) is su\ufb03ciently small with regard to the cell diameter (1-10 \u00b5m).\nMoreover, the tiltangle of the long molecular axes withresp ect to the vector normal\nto the surface is supposed to be small and hence the elasticit y theory is restricted\nwithin the extent of linear approximation. With these consi derations, one obtains\n1\na particular version of the dynamic equations, in which geom etric invariants such\nas the fundamental magnitudes and the curvatures are used to describe the shape\nof the membrane, while the displacement of the con\ufb01guration of the membrane is\ntreated separately from the internal movement ofthe partic lesinside the membrane.\nThe attempt to construct such a group of equations, so far as o ne knows, was made\n10 years ago by Peterson [24]. He established, however, only the dynamic equations\nof a solid \ufb01lm and the hydrodynamic equations of a Newtonian \ufb02 uid membrane,\nseparately. This left a gap between these two limiting cases . One will see that by\nintroducing the theory of liquid crystals the gap is natural ly bridged.\nRecent tetherexperimentssupport theopinionthatslipbet weenthetwomolec-\nular layers causes interlayer viscous dissipation [25] whi ch might not be negligible\nin dynamical studies of bilayer membranes [26]. One recogni zes that this kind of\ninternal dissipation is excluded from the present theoreti cal model.\nThis paper is the \ufb01rst part of a series devoted to present the g eneral electro-\nhydrodynamic equations of polar viscoelastic \ufb02uid membran es isolated from their\nsurroundings. The hydrodynamic theory of liquid crystals w ill be recapitulated in\nthe next section, then it will be adapted to the context of bil ayer membranes in the\nthird section. The connection of such a membrane to the liqui d surroundings will\nbe considered in subsequent papers.\n2. Outline of the Ericksen-Leslie theory\nThe hydrodynamics of liquid crystals was primarily establi shed by Ericksen\n[9]. He assumed an intrinsic motion of the non-spherical mol ecules and used a\ntime-dependent director to indicate it. Because of the mate rial symmetry, he con-\nstructed the constitutive relationships of the dynamic var iables involved and hence\ninterpreted explicitly the dynamic conservation laws for u niaxial liquid crystals.\nLeslie [10] was able to take into account the antisymmetric s tress of the anisotropic\ncontinuum [27,28], which had been overlooked in the express ions of Ericksen, and\nthus provided us a re\ufb01ned version of the theory.\n2\n2.1.

In electrohydrodynamic studies o f liquid crystals, however,\nthe Lorentz force is commonly considered as a cause of instab ilities [17-22]. We do\nnot go far towards calculating completely the force in the el ectric \ufb01eld, but, inaccu-\nrately, equate it to the Lorentz force, which amounts partly to the ponderomotive\nforce in liquid dielectrics [29]. That is\nFe=\u03c1eE (7)\n3\nwhere\u03c1eis the density of injected electric charges and Eis the electric \ufb01eld.\nThe stress tensor consists of three parts [9]\nT=Ti+Te+Tv(8)\nwhereTiis the isotropic part of the stress, Teis the stress arising from elastic\ndeformation and Tvis that from viscous motion.\nThe isotropic part is expressed as\nTi=\u2212\u03c3I (9)\nwhere\u03c3is a constant and Iis the unit tensor.\nThe elastic stress may be deduced from the density of reversi ble deformation\nworkWd[9], i.e.\nTe=\u2212(\u2207d)\u00b7\u2202Wd\n\u2202(d\u2207)(10)\nIt is suggested in the Oseen-Frank-Nehring-Saupe theory th at\nWd=k1(\u2207\u00b7d)\u2212k2(d\u00b7\u2207\u00d7d)+1\n2(k11\u22122k13)(\u2207\u00b7d)2+\n+1\n2k22(d\u00b7\u2207\u00d7d)2+1\n2(k33+2k13)(d\u00b7\u2207d)2\u2212\n\u2212(k12\u2212k23)(d\u00b7\u2207\u00d7d)(\u2207\u00b7d)+k13\u2207\u00b7(d\u2207\u00b7d)\u2212\n\u22121\n2(k22+k24)\u2207\u00b7(d\u2207\u00b7d\u2212d\u00b7\u2207d)\u2212\n\u2212k23\u2207\u00b7[(d\u00b7\u2207\u00d7d)d] (11)\nwhereki\u2019s are the elastic moduli (Frank\u2019s notation [5] is used in thi s paper), among\nwhich the relationship k24=1\n2(k11\u2212k22) holds.\nIn relation (11), the \ufb01rst term originally represented the s play structure result-\ning from the change of symmetry of the material, although liq uid crystals having\nferroelectric features are rarely found in nature.

Adaptation to membranes\nNow we will adapt the Ericksen-Leslie dynamic theory to a bil ayer membrane.\nUnless otherwise stated, the Latin su\ufb03x runs over 1, 2 and 3, w hilst that the Greek\nsu\ufb03xes run over 1 and 2. Italic symbols indicate the componen ts of a vector or\ntensor in the moving local frame (see below) and block symbol s represent those\nin \ufb01xed global coordinates (inertial reference system). Su mmation convention is\nassumed throughout.\nAs suggested in the theory of thin shells, one de\ufb01nes a geomet ric surface situ-\nated at the middle position in the membrane and names it the \u201cm iddle surface\u201d (see\nFig 1). The word \u201csurface\u201d in the following means, uniquely, the middle surface.\nLetrbe the vector from an origin in Euclidean space to a point in th e middle\nsurface. Any spatial position in the membrane is then determ ined by\nxi= ri(\u03b8\u03b1,t)+\u03b83ni(\u03b8\u03b1,t) (30)\nwhere xidenotes the spatial coordinates, \u03b8iare arbitrary parameters and niis the\nnormal vector to the middle surface.\nIf\u03b81and\u03b82areidenti\ufb01edwiththecurvilinearcoordinatesonthemiddl esurface,\nthen the local base vectors are given by\ne\u03b1=\u2202r\n\u2202\u03b8\u03b1e3=n=e1\u00d7e2\n|e1\u00d7e2|=1\u221aa\u2202r\n\u2202\u03b81\u00d7\u2202r\n\u2202\u03b82(31)\nwhereais the determinant of the metric tensor\na\u03b1\u03b2=e\u03b1\u00b7e\u03b2 (32)\nThe second- and the third-order magnitude of the surface are\nb\u03b1\u03b2=\u2212\u2202e3\n\u2202\u03b8\u03b1\u00b7e\u03b2=\u2202e\u03b1\n\u2202\u03b8\u03b2\u00b7e3 (33)\nc\u03b1\u03b2=\u2202e3\n\u2202\u03b8\u03b1\u00b7\u2202e3\n\u2202\u03b8\u03b2(34)\nFor uniquely determined surface, the fundamental magnitud es satisfy the iden-\ntity\nc\u03b1\u03b2\u22122Hb\u03b1\u03b2+Ka\u03b1\u03b2= 0 (35)\nwhere\n2H=a\u03b2\u03b1b\u03b1\u03b2 (36)\nis the \ufb01rst curvature (mean curvature) and\nK=|b\u03b1\u03b2|\n|a\u03b1\u03b2|=b\na(37)\nthe second curvature (gaussian curvature).\n7\nThe director vector d(a unit vector parallel to the long molecular axes) is\nconsidered to radiate from the middle surface on the side to w hich the normal\nvector is positive (Fig. 1).\nThe molecules displace in the Euclidean space at a velocity v. With respect to\nthe local bases eiwhich move with the surface, the velocity has the components\nv\u03b1=\u02d9\u03b8\u03b1, v3= 0 (38)\nbecause the particle \ufb02ow is supposed to be parallel to the sur face. With respect to\nthe spatial coordinates xithe velocity is given by\nvi= \u02d9 xi=ti\n\u03b1v\u03b1+ \u02d9 ri(39)\nwhere\nti\n\u03b1=\u2202ri\n\u2202\u03b8\u03b1(40)\nis a time-dependent hybrid tensor. The tensor ti\n\u03b1is used to associate the \ufb02exible\nand movable surface with the inertial reference system. For example, if the director\nis known by its components dkwith respect to the local bases, then its components\nin the global coordinates must be dk=tk\n\u03b1d\u03b1+nkd3. Conversely, while one has the\nexpansion of a \ufb01eld vector at a certain position of the middle surface with respect\nto the \ufb01xed coordinates, say, E k, one knows naturally, with respect to the moving\nframe, its tangential parts E\u03b1=tk\n\u03b1Ekand its normal part E(n)=E3= Eknk. The\nsubscript ( n) denotes the normal part of the vectors.\nOne de\ufb01nes the varying con\ufb01guration of the surface in a way th at any point\nof the surface at the considered instant/parenleftbig\n\u03b81,\u03b82,t/parenrightbig\nis the endpoint of a translation\nof the point which occupied the same curvilinear coordinate s on the surface at the\npreceding instant/parenleftbig\n\u03b81,\u03b82,t\u25e6/parenrightbig\nalong the normal vector n\u25e6.

(The assumption v\u03b1\n,3= 0 implies that the two\nmolecular layers do not mutually slip.)

Emphasis is\ngiven to the e\ufb00ects of externally induced extinction of a \ufb01xed fract ion\nof species at the outset of the evolutionary process. The manner the\necosystem copes with the initial extinction event depends on the de -\ngree of competition among the species as well as on the strength of\nthat event. For instance, in the regime of high competition the ecos ys-\ntem diversity, given by the fraction of surviving species, is practica lly\ninsensitive to the strength of the initial extinction provided it is not\ntoo large, while in the less competitive regime the diversity decreases\nlinearlywith the size ofthe event. In the case oflargeextinction eve nts\nwe \ufb01nd that no further biotic extinctions take place and, furtherm ore,\nthat rare species become very unlikely to be found in the ecosystem at\nequilibrium. In addition, we show that the reciprocal of the Edwards -\nAnderson order parameter yields a good measure of the diversity o f\nthe model ecosystem.\nPACS: 87.10+e, 87.90.+y, 89.90+n\n1\n1 Introduction\nExtinction seems to be the \ufb01nal outcome of the evolution of species . In fact, as\nspecies survive about 10 million years in the average, nearly all specie s that have\neverexistedareextinct andonlyaverysmallfractionofthemhave left theirimpres-\nsions in the fossil record [1, 2]. The causes of the mass extinction ev ents is currently\na matter of dispute as there are two main types of explanations [3]. T he more tra-\nditional one asserts that extinction is caused by external stress es as, for instance,\nmajor climate changes and asteroids impacts. This point of view is sup ported by\nsome evidences such as the unusual quantity of iridium and other no ble metals in\nthe rocks that marked the boundary between the Cretaceous an d Tertiary periods,\nwhen the era of the dinosaurs was replaced by the era of the mamma ls [4]. Since\niridium is more common in asteroids than in the Earth\u2019s crust, this \ufb01ndin g can be\nviewed as evidence for an asteroid impact. The alternative explanat ion asserts that\nextinctions are caused by the interactions between the species in t he ecosystems.\nIn particular, Paine [5] has shown that species richness sometimes c an be increased\nby the predator-mediated coexistence, and the removal of pred ators can lead to\nadditional species extinctions. Some recent studies indicate that f ood webs with\nmany species or high connectivity are more likely to lose species as a co nsequence\nof the extinction of a single species when compared with more simple fo od webs\n[6, 7]. Although this kind of argument seems well suited to explain the s o-called\nbackground extinctions, it certainly needs some new ingredients to explain mass\nextinctions as well. In fact, the missing ingredient seems to be the se lf-organized\ncriticality concept [8], which in this context is best illustrated by the po pular Bak-\nSneppen model [9]. According to this model, the \ufb01tness of each spec ies is a\ufb00ected\nby the other species to which it is coupled in the ecosystem so that lar ge events\nin the evolutionary history may be thought of as large coevolutionar y avalanches\ncaused by the intrinsic dynamics of the model. In this model, the distr ibution of\nthe extinction sizes follows a power law, which is a valid candidate for \ufb01t ting to the\nexperimental data.\nAlthough we recognize that evolution and hence extinction are, as p ictured by\nthe models mentioned above, essentially dynamical phenomena, in th is work we\nstudy these phenomena within the equilibrium statistical mechanics f ramework of\nthe random replicator model for species coevolution [10, 11, 12, 13 ]. Deterministic\nreplicator models are commonly used to describe the evolution of self -reproducing\nentities in a variety of \ufb01elds such as game theory, prebiotic evolution and sociobiol-\nogy [14, 15]. The random replicator model introduced by Diederich an d Opper [10]\nattempts to model the uncertainties and the overwhelming complex ity of the in-\nterspecies interactions in biological ecosystems by assuming that t hose interactions\nare random. However, it is also assumed that the dynamics is such th at a \ufb01tness\nfunctional (Lyapunov function) is maximized so that the only statio nary states are\n\ufb01xed points. In fact, the existence of such a functional leads to a replicator equa-\ntion with symmetric interspecies interactions[15] which is a severeas sumption from\nthe biological standpoint. It allows, however, full use of tools of th e equilibrium\n2\nstatistical mechanics to study analytically the averageproperties of the equilibrium\nstates of this kind of disordered ecosystems.\nAn interesting result of the random replicator model is that in the eq uilibrium\nstate a fraction of the species is extinct [10]. The mechanism of extin ction is clearly\noutcompetition and, in the absence of any cooperation pressure, only the pair of\nspecies with the largest reinforcing interactions will thrive. In this c ontribution we\nstudy the e\ufb00ects of random elimination of a \ufb01xed fraction of the spe cies at the out-\nset of the evolutionaryprocess, giving emphasis to the distribution of the remaining\nspecies concentrations in the equilibrium state. There are several interesting issues\nthat can be addressed in this framework. For instance, what is the equilibrium situ-\nation when the fraction of species eliminated at the beginning is alread y largerthan\nthe fraction that would be extinct naturally due to outcompetition? Furthermore,\nhow does the ecosystem cope with large initial extinction events? In this paper we\ngive clear-cut analytic answers to these questions which are partly corroborated by\nnumerical simulations of the model ecosystem.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2 we intro duce the\nmodel and discussthe ecologicalinterpretationofthe controlpa rameters. The equi-\nlibrium properties ofthe model arederived within the replica-symmet ricframework\nin Sec. 3 and the use of the reciprocal of the Edwards-Anderson o rder parameter\nas a measure for the diversity of the ecosystem is suggested. In S ec. 4 we calculate\nthe distribution of probability of the concentrations of a given spec ies, allowing\nthus the explicit calculation of the ecosystem diversity as the fract ion of surviving\nspecies at equilibrium. Finally, in Sec. 5 we present some concluding rem arks.\n2 Model\nWe consider an in\ufb01nite population (ecosystem) composed of individua ls belonging\ntoNdi\ufb00erent species whose \ufb01tness Fi(i= 1,...,N) are the derivatives Fi=\n\u2202F/\u2202xiof the \ufb01tness functional Fde\ufb01ned as\n\u2212F=H(x) =u/summationdisplay\nibix2\ni+/summationdisplay\ni<jJijbixibjxj (1)\nwherexi\u2208[0,\u221e) is the fraction of species iandbiis a quenched random variable\nthat takes the values 0 and 1 with probabilities aand 1\u2212a, respectively. Hence Na\nrandomly chosen species are eliminated at the outset in the average and so hence-\nforth we will refer to a\u2208[0,1] as the dilution parameter. An e\ufb00ective competition\namong the species is enforced by requiring that the concentration s of the surviving\nspecies satisfy the constraint\nN/summationdisplay\ni=1bixi=Q0N, (2)\nwhereQ0is an arbitrary positive constant which gives the scale of the concen -\ntrations xi.

The self-interaction parameter u\u22650 acts as a global coopera-\ntion pressure limiting the growth of any single species, and it is crucial to guarantee\nthe existence of a nontrivial thermodynamic limit, N\u2192 \u221e. In fact, for large u\nthe minimum of Hcorresponds to a homogeneous ecosystem where the surviving\nspecies have concentrations xi/Q0= 1/(1\u2212a)\u2200i. The positive self-interactions\nmeans that individuals of a same species compete against themselves , which is\nquite reasonable as they certainly share the same resources (eco logical niche).\nThe time evolution of the species concentrations is given by the replic ator equa-\ntion\ndxi\ndt=\u2212xi/bracketleftBigg\n\u2202H(x)\n\u2202xi\u22121\nN/summationdisplay\nkxk\u2202H(x)\n\u2202xk/bracketrightBigg\n\u2200i (4)\nwhichminimizes H(x)whilekeepingtheterm/summationtext\nibixiconstantduringtheevolution.\nHence the \ufb01xed points of this equation are the minima of H(x) and in the following\nwe use the replica formalism to study analytically the statistical prop erties of these\nminima.\n3 The replica approach\nFollowing the standard prescription of performing quenched avera ges on extensive\nquantities only [16], we de\ufb01ne the average free-energy density fas\n\u2212\u03b2f= lim\nN\u2192\u221e1\nN/angbracketleftlnZ/angbracketright (5)\nwhere\nZ=/integraldisplay\u221e\n0/productdisplay\nidxi\u03b4/parenleftBigg\nQ0N\u2212/summationdisplay\nibixi/parenrightBigg/parenleftBigg\nQN\u2212/summationdisplay\nixi(1\u2212bi)/parenrightBigg\ne\u2212\u03b2H(x)(6)\nis the partition function and \u03b2= 1/Tis the inverse temperature.

(17)\nWe note that the parameter associated to the concentration of s urviving species\nQ0appears only as a scale of qand so henceforth we will set Q0= 1 without loss\nof generality. In the replica-symmetric framework the Edwards-A nderson order\nparameter qis de\ufb01ned by\nq=/angbracketleftBigg\n1\nN/summationdisplay\ni/angbracketleftxi/angbracketright2\nT/angbracketrightBigg\n. (18)\nIf the concentrations xiwere normalized to 1 rather than to Nthenqwould give\nthe probability that two randomly selected individuals are of the same species, a\nquantity known as Simpson\u2019s index [17]. Nevertheless, we can still give a simple\nphysical interpretation to q. For instance, values of qof order of 1 indicate the\ncoexistence of a macroscopicnumber of species (i.e., xi\u22481 for an extensive number\nof species), while large values of qsignalize the dominance ofa few species only (i.e.,\nxi\u2248Nfor a \ufb01nite number of species). Of course, this interpretation is eq uivalent\nto that given above for Simpson\u2019s index, and so we can view 1 /qas a measure\nof the diversity of the ecosystem. In Fig. 1 we present 1 /qas a function of the\ndilution parameter afor several values of the cooperation pressure u. The results\nof the numerical solution of the replicator equation, Eq. (4), for N= 500 are also\npresented. Each data point is the average over 100 realizations of the matrix of\ncoupling strengths, starting with an uniform distribution of concen trations. Since\nthe labeling of the species is arbitrary we can set bi= 0 fori\u2264aNandbi= 1\notherwise, without loss of generality. In addition, we choose asuch that aNis\ninteger for simplicity. In agreement with our interpretation, for aclose to 1 we\ncan observe the vanishing of 1 /q, which characterizes an ecosystem composed of\na few species only. For small values of uthe analytical results show the existence\nof a maximum of diversity for a nonzero value of the dilution paramete r (see the\ninset in Fig. 1); the numerical results however do not corroborate this \ufb01nding.

Figure 2 shows the regions in the plane ( a,u) where the replica-\nsymmetric solution is stable. In particular, we \ufb01nd that for a= 0 this solution\nis stable for u >1/\u221a\n2 while for a= 1 it is stable for u >1/2. Hence, the maxima\nobserved in Fig. 1 are indeed artifacts of the replica-symmetry fra mework. Nev-\nertheless, the agreement between the analytical and numerical r esults is already\nexcelent for u >0.6. The rather puzzling independence of the diversity on the\ndilution parameter for small uhas a simple explanation as will be seen in the next\nsection.\n4 Discussion\nAlthough the interpretation of the reciprocal of the Edwards-An derson order pa-\nrameter as the ecosystem diversity yields some information on the d istribution of\nspecies at equilibrium, a better understanding is achieved by calculat ing explicitly\n7\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\na0.50.60.70.8u\n\u03bb > 0\u03bb < 0\nFigure 2: Almeida-Thouless line separating the regions of s tability ( \u03bb <0)\nand instability ( \u03bb >0) of the replica-symmetric solution.\nthe probability distribution that the concentration of one of the (1 \u2212a)Nremaining\nspecies, say xk, assumes the value x, de\ufb01ned by\nPk(x) = lim\n\u03b2\u2192\u221e/angbracketleftBigg/integraldisplay\u221e\n0/productdisplay\njdxjbk\u03b4(xk\u2212x)W(x)/angbracketrightBigg\n(20)\nwithW(x) given by Eq. (13). As all non-vanishing species concentrations ar e\nequivalent we can write Pk(x) =P(x)\u2200k. Hence to evaluate Eq. (20) we introduce\nthe auxiliary energy\nHaux(x) =H(x)+h/summationdisplay\nkbk\u03b4(xk\u2212x), (21)\nso that\nP(x) =\u2212lim\n\u03b2\u2192\u221e1\nN\u03b2\u2202/angbracketleftlnZaux/angbracketright\n\u2202h/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle\nh=0(22)\nwhereZauxis the partition function (6) with Hreplaced by Haux. Using Eq.\n(22) the calculations needed to evaluate P(x) become analogous to those used in\nthe evaluation of the free-energy density (14). In addition, to ha ndle a possible\nsingularity in the limit \u03b2\u2192 \u221eit is more convenient to deal with the cumulative\ndistribution function C(x) =/integraltextx\n0dx\u2032P(x\u2032).

In addition, a nonzero value of C(0) indicates that the probability dis-\ntribution P(x) has a delta peak at x= 0 and so C(0) actually yields the fraction\nof the species that survived the initial externally induced extinction event but that\nwere extinct later on due to outcompetition. In the regime of large d ilution, say\na >0.8 in Fig. 3, the cumulative distribution is very small and practically cons tant\nfor small concentrations, indicating that no further extinctions h ave taken place\nand, furthermore, that rare species are very unlikely to be found in the ecosystem\nat equilibrium. We note that the numerical simulations yield results pra ctically in-\ndistinguishable from the analytical ones. The rough independence o f the diversity\n1/qon the dilution parameter aobserved in Fig. 1 for small uis easily understood\nwith the aid of the cumulated distributions. In fact, a direct measur e of the ecosys-\ntem diversity is given by the fraction of surviving species 1 \u2212a\u2212 C(0), which is\nshown in Fig. 4 as function of a. (We recall that ais the fraction of species that\nwere extinct at the outset due to some external stress and C(0) is the fraction that\ndied out due to outcompetition.) The remarkable similarity between th ese \ufb01gures\ncorroborates our interpretation of 1 /qas a measure of the diversity. Clearly, the\ndiversity is insensitive to variations of awhenever the fraction of extinct species in\nthe undisturbed ecosystem (i.e. C(0) calculated at a= 0) is already considerably\nlargerthan a, sothat the species eliminated at the outset wouldprobablybe extin ct\nlater on anyway.\n5 Conclusion\nAlthough the dynamics of the random replicator model may not look v ery appeal-\ning, in the sense that it always leads to \ufb01xed points, the frustration caused by the\ncompetition between the concentration limiting self-interactions ( u >0) and the\ntendency to unlimited growth of pairs of strongly cooperative ( Jij<0) species\nresults in a highly nontrivial equilibrium, characterized by many meta- stable states\n[10] and a phase of replica symmetry breaking [11]. Of course, these very features\nmake some aspects of the dynamics (e.g., slow relaxation and hyster esis e\ufb00ects)\nnontrivial as well. The wealth of ecologically relevant issues that can b e addressed\nwithin this equilibrium framework can be appreciated, for instance, in the case of\nhigh-orderinteractionsamongthe species where it has been repor tedthe emergence\nof a threshold value which gives a lower bound to the concentration o f the surviv-\ning species, preventing then the existence of rare (low concentra tion) species in the\necosystem [13].\nAn important outcome of the equilibrium analysis of the random replica tor\nmodel is the \ufb01nding that in order to reduce the degree of frustrat ion a fraction\nof the species dies out [10]. This type of extinction has clearly a biotic c ause,\nnamely, outcompetition [19]. In this paper we study how the model ec osystem\n9\n0 2 4 6 8\nx00.20.40.60.81C0\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\nFigure 3: Cumulative distribution of the concentration of t he initially sur-\nviving species in equilibrium for u= 0.8 and (top to bottom) a= 0, 0.4,\n0.6, and 0.8. The dashed curves are the results of the numerical solutio n of\nthe replicator equation.\ncopes with abiotic or externally induced extinction, in which a fraction of randomly\nchosen species is eliminated at the beginning of the coevolutionarypr ocess. We \ufb01nd\nthat in the regime of high competition (small u) the ecosystem diversity, i.e., the\nfraction of surviving species is practically insensitive to the strengt haof the initial\nextinction provided it is not too large, while in the less competitive regim e (largeu)\nthe diversity decreases linearly with increasing a. In the case of a large extinction\nevent we \ufb01nd that no further (biotic) extinctions take place and, f urthermore, that\nrare species become very unlikely to be found in the ecosystem at eq uilibrium. This\nis distinct from the result mentioned above for the case of high-ord er interactions\nwhere the probability of \ufb01nding rare species in the ecosystem is stric tly null [13].\nAn interesting by-product of our investigation is the \ufb01nding that th e recipro-\ncal of the Edwards-Anderson order parameter (i.e., the replica-s ymmetric overlap\nbetween two equilibrium states) serves as an easy-to-calculate me asure of the di-\nversity of the model ecosystem. This opens the exciting possibility o f interpreting\nthe di\ufb00erent hierarquical levels of the overlap order parameter in t he full replica\nsymmetry breaking scheme [16] as di\ufb00erent levels of a phylogenetic t ree that gives\nthe relations of dependence (viewed as ancestrality) among the sp ecies.\nAcknowledgments\nThe work of J.F.F. is supported in part by Conselho Nacional de Desen volvi\n10\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\na00.20.40.60.81\u2212a\u2212C(0)1\nFigure 4: Fraction of surviving species as a function of the d ilution pa-\nrameter afor (top to bottom) u= 1.3 (/circleco\u221ayrt),1.0 (\u2737),0.8 (\u25bd),0.6 (\u2738) and\n0.3 (\u25b3).

The synaptic couplings between\nthese model neurons, Jij, are chosen at random at the beginning and kept \ufb01xed, and then\nthe system evolves deterministically according to the equation\n\u03c3i(t+1) = sign\uf8eb\n\uf8ed/summationdisplay\njJij\u03c3j(t)\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 (1)\n(parallel updating; alternatively, one can consider sequential upd ating when \u03c3i(t+ 1) is\ndetermined by the state of \u03c3j(t+1) forj < iand by\u03c3j(t) forj > i).\nThis procedure de\ufb01nes a disordered dynamical system: the evolut ion is deterministic,\nbut its rules are chosen at random at the beginning and kept \ufb01xed. I n other words, we can\nrewrite the dynamic law in the form\nC(t+1) =fJ(C(t)), (2)\n1\nwhereCrepresents a con\ufb01guration of the system, i.e.a set of values of the Nvariables \u03c3i,fJ\nis a random realization of a deterministic map and the set of indices Jlabels the realization\nof the dynamic rules.\nThe most natural distance in con\ufb01guration space is the normalized H amming distance,\nde\ufb01ned as\nd(C,C\u2032) =1\nN/summationdisplay\ni|\u03c3i\u2212\u03c3\u2032\ni|. (3)\nWe are interested in the statistical properties of the motion asymp totically in time and\nsystem size. As the motion is deterministic and con\ufb01guration space is \ufb01nite, asymptotically\nin time the dynamics takes place on periodic orbits, and the quantities of interest are the\nlengths and the number of such orbits as well as the size of their att raction basins. Such\nquantities are random variables, depending on the realization of the dynamical rules, and\nwe will study their probability distribution.\nWhen the couplings are symmetric ( Jij=Jji) it is possible to de\ufb01ne a Hamiltonian so\nthat equation (1) represents the zero temperature dynamics of a thermodynamic system.\nIn particular, if the Jijare chosen from a distribution with zero mean and variance 1 /N\n(for instance a Gaussian distribution) we are dealing with the zero te mperature dynamics\nof the SK model (in the case of sequential updating: the parallel up dating does not imply\na relaxational dynamics). In the Hop\ufb01eld model the couplings are sy mmetric, too, but they\nare chosen according to the Hebbian rule:\nJij=P/summationdisplay\n\u00b5=1\u03be\u00b5\ni\u03be\u00b5\nj, (4)\nwherethe Pvectors of Nbinaryvariables, \u03be\u00b5, represent thememorizedpatterns. Thesystem\nis able to memorize, in the sense that the patterns are \ufb01xed points o f the dynamics and they\nare stable against random perturbations if their number does not e xceed the capacity of the\nnetwork, i.e.ifPis not larger than \u03b1cN, with\u03b1c\u22480.14. So, given a number of microscopic\nstates growing as 2N, the Hop\ufb01eld model is able to memorize a number of patterns growing\nlinearly with N.\nAsymmetric neural networks received a largeattention in the litera ture in the late \u201980s[3,\n4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. In 1986 it was proposed to generalize the Hop\ufb01eld mode l by taking into account\nalso asymmetric couplings [2].This generalization appears more realistic , since synapses in\nnature are in general not symmetric, and it suggests a possible way to distinguish between\na network that has remembered a learned pattern and a network w hich is in a confused\nstate (such a distinction is not possible in the Hop\ufb01eld model). In fact , in asymmetric\nneural networks, two kind of attractors are present: \u201cordere d\u201d attractors, that are either\nshort cycles or \ufb01xed points, and \u201cchaotic\u201d attractors, whose len gth grows exponentially with\nsystem size. The \ufb01rst numerical observations of this twofold natu re of the attractors are due\nto Gutfreund, Reger and Young [5] and to N\u00a8 utzel [9].\nIn this note we are mainly interested in the study of the properties o f the attractors,\nsuch as the probability distributions of their lengths, of their numbe r and of the size of their\nattraction basins. We will consider only the case of fully asymmetric c ouplings, i.e.Jij\nandJjiare independent random variables. In this case analytical results h ave already been\nobtained about the correlation functions [6, 7] and about the numb er of attractors [11], but\n2\nmoreabouttheattractorscanbesaidusingasimplestochasticsch eme basedontheannealed\napproximation. This approximation was introduced in the study of dis ordered dynamical\nsystems by Derrida and Pomeau [12] to study damage spreading in Ka u\ufb00man networks (a\ndisordered dynamical system proposed as a model of the genetic r egulation in cells [13]). In\n[14] we showed that it can also be used to obtain information about th e attractors of that\nmodel.\nA reason of interest of this study is that asymmetric neural netwo rks are the limit case\nof a one parameter family of models, the parameter \u03b7representing the symmetry of the\nsynaptic couplings:\n\u03b7=\u221dan}bracketle{tJijJji\u221dan}bracketri}ht\n\u221dan}bracketle{tJij\u221dan}bracketri}ht2. (5)\nThe case \u03b7= 0 represents the present model (fully asymmetric couplings), wh ile for\n\u03b7= 1 the couplings are fully symmetric and we obtain the mean \ufb01eld model of spin glasses.\nThus the parameter \u03b7connects with continuity asymmetric neural networks to a disorde red\nsystem of statistical mechanics.\nIt was suggested through numerical simulations that the model wit h generic correlation\nundergoes a dynamical transition when \u03b7is changed [9, 10, 15]. The transition seems to\ntake place when the absolute value of \u03b7crosses the value 1 /2. For|\u03b7|<1/2 the dynamics\nis chaotic and the typical length of the cycles increases exponentia lly with the number of\nneuronsN, while for |\u03b7|>1/2 the dynamics is frozen and the typical length of the cycles\ndoes not increase with system size (most of the cycles have length 2 , for positive \u03b7, and 4\nfor negative \u03b7).\nThis transition is reminiscent of the dynamical transition taking place in Kau\ufb00man net-\nworks. Also in that case the typical length of the cycles grows expo nentially with Nin the\nso called chaotic phase, remains \ufb01nite in the frozen phase and grows less than exponentially\nwithNon the critical line [13, 14]. It was claimed by Kau\ufb00man that the critical line of\nhis model can be a good model of the genetic regulatory systems ac ting in cell di\ufb00erentia-\ntion, thus showing that such systems do not need to be tuned in the very details by natural\nselection but behave similarly to typical realizations of an ensemble of random regulatory\nnetworks [13]. It is possible that, analogously, also the supposed cr itical point in attractor\nneural networks, where chaotic and ordered cycles coexist, can suggest something interesting\nfrom a biological point of view. We think that our method can be modi\ufb01e d to give informa-\ntion about systems with generic asymmetry and about the suppose d phase transition that\nthey undergo, though this probably requires to go beyond the ann ealed approximation.\n2 Closing probabilities\n2.1 General framework\nOurstrategyforthestudyofattractorsindisordereddynamica l systems hasasstartingpoint\nthe probability distribution of the distance at di\ufb00erent time steps. A ctually, the information\ncontained in the distribution of the distance is much more than what w e need and this\ndistribution is in principle a very complicated object, so that our appr oach may seem to\n3\ncomplicate the problem. But, in some cases, the distance can be well approximated by a\nsuitably de\ufb01ned stochastic process and the computation becomes much easier. The simplest\npossibility is to approximate the distance with a Markovian stochastic process. This is what\nwe call here the annealed approximation .\nAn apparently paradoxical aspect of this approach is that in disord ered dynamical sys-\ntems attractors exist due to the fact that the motion is determinis tic. Stochastic processes,\non the other hand, have nothing similar to a limit cycle. Nevertheless, all the properties of\ntheattractorscanbederived fromthedistribution ofdistances, which is awell de\ufb01ned object\nin both kinds of models. We can not pursue this analogy up to times larg er than the time\nof \ufb01rst recurrence of a con\ufb01guration already visited, when the de terministic motion becomes\nperiodic. But this is enough, since the \ufb01rst recurrence provides us with every information\nabout the length of the cycles and the transient time.\nThe fundamental object of our study will be then the distribution o f distances between\ncon\ufb01gurations at time steps tandt\u2032> ton the same trajectory, restricted to trajectories\nthat have not yet visited twice any con\ufb01guration up to the larger tim et\u2032(thus the e\ufb00ects of\nperiodicity do not yet appear). We will call this condition the opening c ondition, and denote\nit by the symbol At\u2032. The closing probability \u03c0N(t,t\u2032) is the probability that con\ufb01gurations\nat time steps tandt\u2032are equal ( d(t,t\u2032) = 0), subject to the opening condition:\n\u03c0N(t,t\u2032) = Pr{d(t,t\u2032) = 0|At\u2032} (6)\n(the subscript Nis there to remember the dependence on system size).\nAfter the closing time t\u2032the trajectory enters a periodic orbit of length l=t\u2032\u2212t, where\ntis the transient time. In terms of the closing probabilities, the proba bility to \ufb01nd such\na trajectory is easily computed. First we have to know the probabilit yFN(t) that the\ntrajectory was not closed before time t\u2032=t+l. This obeys the equation FN(t+ 1) =\nFN(t)/parenleftBig\n1\u2212/summationtextt\u22121\nt\u2032=0\u03c0N(t\u2032,t)/parenrightBig\n, whence, introducing a continuous time variable, we get\nFN(t) = exp/parenleftBigg\n\u2212/integraldisplayt\n0dt\u2032/integraldisplayt\u2032\n0dt\u2032\u2032\u03c0N(t\u2032,t\u2032\u2032)/parenrightBigg\n(7)\n(to have a slightly simpler formula we made the hypothesis that the ty pical closing times are\nlong, which is normally the case in the chaotic phase, where they grow exponentially with\nsystem size N, and we transformed the sum into an integral).\nThe probability to \ufb01nd a trajectory that, after a transient time t, enters a cycle of length\nlis then obtained multiplying FN(t+l) times the closing probability \u03c0N(t,t+l).\n2.2 The annealed approximation\nRegarding the distance as a Markovian stochastic process is a very drastic approximation.\nIn our case it sounds reasonable when the temporal distance lis large, since the model that\nwe study is known to have a behavior very reminiscent of chaos [15]. H owever in this way\nwe neglect some memory e\ufb00ects, which can play a fundamental role in systems with nonzero\nsymmetry.\nThis approximation was \ufb01rst used in this context by Derrida and Pome au [12], who\nstudied the damage spreading in Kau\ufb00man networks. They showed t hat the average value\n4\nof the Hamming distance between two di\ufb00erent trajectories is equiv alent, in the in\ufb01nite\nsystem limit, to the average value of the Markovian stochastic proc ess obtained extracting\nnew dynamical rules at every time step and keeping memory only of th e value of the distance\nat time step t\u22121. Thus the disorder is treated as annealed rather than as quench ed. In\nother words, instead of considering an ensemble of trajectories, each one taking place on a\n\ufb01xed realization of the dynamical rules, they consider an ensemble o f trajectories moving\nfrom one realization of the dynamical rules to another one, in the sa me spirit in which the\nannealed average is used for disordered thermodynamical system s.\nThe above procedure can be shown to describe exactly the evolutio n of the average\ndistance up to time of order log Nin disordered systems with \ufb01nite connectivity [16, 17],\nbut we think that its validity is more general. In systems with in\ufb01nite co nnectivity like the\none that we are studying here, or when one is interested in the whole distribution of the\ndistance, the equivalence between the two dynamics has not been p roved, and we have to\nassume that a typical trajectory of the quenched system loses m emory of the details of the\nrealization of dynamical rules under which it evolves. In the Random M ap model [18] this\nis trivially true. In other cases this can be thought of as a maximal ign orance hypothesis,\nwhose consequences must then be compared with numerical simulat ions.\nLet us state some of these consequences. A Markovian stochast ic process, if its transition\nprobabilityisergodic1, converges toastationarystochasticvariableindependent ofth einitial\ndistribution. This means that the closing probability \u03c0N(t,t+l) converges to a stationary\nvalue\u03c0\u2217\nN. This is also independent of lif the transition probability does not depend on this\nquantity. We will show that this happens in the present case, at leas t forllarge enough.\nIt is then easy to compute the probability of a trajectory which, af ter a transient time\nt, enters a cycle of length l(withlandtlarge enough, so that the closing probability has\nreached its asymptotic value): using the results of last section, we get\nPr{T=t,L=l}=1\n\u03c42\nNexp\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\u22121\n2/parenleftBiggt+l\n\u03c4N/parenrightBigg2\uf8f6\n\uf8f8, (8)\nwhere\u03c4N=\u03c0\u2217\nN\u22121/2is the typical time scale of the problem, in the sense that the random\nvariable t/\u03c4Nhas a well de\ufb01ned density of probability even in the limit where \u03c4goes to\nin\ufb01nity. All the dependence on system size is contained into the fact or\u03c0\u2217\nN, which is expected\nto decrease exponentially with Nin the chaotic phase. For instance, for a uniform Random\nMap [18], which is the most chaotic disordered dynamical system, it ho lds\u03c0\u2217\nN= 1/2N, and\nconsequently the typical time scale of the attractors grows as 2N/2.\nThe properties of Random Maps can be easily generalized starting fr om equation (8). An\ninteresting quantity is the distribution of the attraction basin weigh ts. This was analytically\ncomputed by Derrida and Flyvbjerg for the case of the uniform RM [1 9]. The weight of the\nattraction basin of cycle \u03b1,W\u03b1, is de\ufb01ned as the probability to extract at random an initial\ncon\ufb01guration which will reach asymptotically the attractor \u03b1. The statistical information\nabout the distribution of the weights can be expressed through th e \u201cmoments\u201d \u221dan}bracketle{tYn\u221dan}bracketri}ht, de\ufb01ned\n1In the present case, in order to have an ergodic transition probab ility, we must exclude as starting\npoint the distance d= 0 which is an absorbing point (if d(t,t+l) = 0, we must have with probability one\nd(t\u2032,t\u2032+l) = 0 for every t\u2032\u2265t), that is we have to impose the condition that the trajectory is not yet closed,\nas we did.\n5\nas\n\u221dan}bracketle{tYn\u221dan}bracketri}ht=/summationdisplay\n\u03b1\u221dan}bracketle{tWn\n\u03b1\u221dan}bracketri}ht. (9)\nY1is equal to 1 due to the normalization of the weights and Y2represents the average\nweight in a given dynamical system. Its extreme values, 1 and 0, cor respond respectively\nto the \u201cergodic\u201d case where there is only one relevant attractor a nd to the case where there\nis an in\ufb01nite number of relevant attractors, while a \ufb01nite value of Y2means that there is a\n\ufb01nite number of attractors with non vanishing weight. This quantity \ufb02uctuates from sample\nto sample, so it is necessary to consider an average over the realiza tions of the dynamical\nrules, that is represented by the angular brackets.\nThe method used in[19] to compute the distribution of theweight can be applied without\nmodi\ufb01cations to all disordered dynamical systems where the closing probability reaches an\nasymptotic value, \u03c0\u2217\nN, andthe result do not depend onthis value in the largesize limit. Thus\nthe distribution of the attraction basin weights is universal for all the disordered dynamical\nsystems where the closing probability reaches a stationary value [14 , 21], apart for systems\nwhich possess some symmetry. The result for the average value of theYnis [19]\n\u221dan}bracketle{tYn\u221dan}bracketri}ht=4n\u22121[(n\u22121)!]2\n(2n\u22121)!. (10)\nThe \ufb02uctuations from sample to sample can also be computed. For ex ample the \ufb02uctu-\nations of Y2are measured by \u221dan}bracketle{tY2\n2\u221dan}bracketri}ht\u2212\u221dan}bracketle{tY2\u221dan}bracketri}ht2, and do not cancel even in the in\ufb01nite size limit\nN\u2192 \u221e.\nThe average number of attractors of length lcan be computed starting with the relation\n\u221dan}bracketle{tna(l)\u221dan}bracketri}ht=2N\nlPr{T= 0,L=l}. (11)\nIn this formula, the probability Pr {L=l,T= 0}should be computed multiplying\nFN(l), given in equation (7), times the closing probability \u03c0N(0,l). This is di\ufb00erent from\nthe asymptotic value (for large t) of\u03c0N(t,t+l). According to the hypothesis, on which the\nannealed approximation relies, that the system is going to lose memor y of the details of the\nevolution, we expect no correlations between the initial con\ufb01gurat ion and a con\ufb01guration at\na large time lor, in other words, we expect the closing probability to be, asympto tically in\nl,\u03c0N(0,l) = 1/2N. For chaotic Kau\ufb00man networks this can be explicitly computed in the\nframework of the annealed approximation, which is then consistent under this point of view.\nMoreover, we \ufb01nd in this case \u03c0N(0,l) =cl1/2N, wherecldoes not depend on N. Thus it\nholds\n\u221dan}bracketle{tna(l)\u221dan}bracketri}ht \u2248cl\nlexp/parenleftBig\n\u2212l2/2\u03c42/parenrightBig\n. (12)\nSumming over lwe obtain the average value of the total number of cycles, whose le ading\nterm inNis equal to log \u03c4N. Since in the chaotic phase the time scale grows exponentially\nwithsystemsize, thenumberofattractorsisproportionalto Ninthiscase. Thiscomputation\nholds for chaotic Kau\ufb00man networks in the framework of the annea led approximation, but\nwe expect it to hold more generally under the hypothesis discussed a bove.\n6\n2.3 Master equation\nThe general scheme described above must be modi\ufb01ed in the case st udied in this note, to\ntake into account the symmetry ofthe problem. Let us de\ufb01ne the r eversal operator, R, which\nreverses all the spins. This operator commutes with the dynamics o f the system. Using the\nnotation de\ufb01ned in equation (2), we can write:\nfJ(RC) =RfJ(C), (13)\nThis implies that we can de\ufb01ne two di\ufb00erent closing times:\n1. The \ufb01rst time twhenC(t) is equal to C(t+l).\n2. The\ufb01rsttimewhen C(t+l)isequalto RC(t): thenequation(13)implies C(t+2l) =C(t).\nIn other words, the trajectory has reached, after a transient timet, a cycle of length\n2l.\nThese closing events can be described in terms of the Hamming distan ce between con-\n\ufb01gurations: the \ufb01rst one corresponds to d(t,t+l) = 0, while the second one corresponds to\nd(t,t+l) = 1. Thus two closing probabilities must be de\ufb01ned:\n\u03c0(0)\nN(t,t\u2032) = Pr{d(t,t\u2032) = 0|At\u2032}, (14)\n\u03c0(1)\nN(t,t\u2032) = Pr{d(t,t\u2032) = 1|At\u2032}, (15)\nand the opening condition, At, has the meaning that up to time tit never occurred either\nd(t1,t2) = 0 or d(t1,t2) = 1. Our task is now to compute the master equation for the\ndistribution of the distance under the opening condition (this means that we consider only\ntrajectories not yet closed) and under the hypothesis that the d istribution of d(t+1,t\u2032+1)\ndepends only on the distribution of d(t,t\u2032). This is not a di\ufb03cult task. To simplify slightly\ntheformulaswewillconsider, insteadofthedistance, theoverlap q= 1\u2212d, whichismeasured\nby the number of elements whose state is the same in the two con\ufb01gu rations, divided by N.\nAn element \u03c3iis in the same state at time t+1 andt\u2032+1 if its local \ufb01eld has the same\nsign at time steps tandt\u2032. Thus it holds\n\u03c3i(t+1)\u03c3i(t\u2032+1) = sign\uf8eb\n\uf8ed/summationdisplay\njkJijJik\u03c3k(t)\u03c3j(t\u2032)\uf8f6\n\uf8f8. (16)\nLet us consider separately the contribution to this sum coming from the spins whose\nstate is the same at time steps tandt\u2032, whose number is Nq(t,t\u2032), and that belong to a set\nthat we indicate with the name I(t,t\u2032). We can then write\n\u03c3i(t+1)\u03c3i(t\u2032+1) = sign/parenleftBig\n(h+\ni(t))2\u2212(h\u2212\ni(t))2/parenrightBig\n, (17)\nwhere\nh+\ni(t) =/summationdisplay\nj\u2208I(t,t\u2032)Jij\u03c3j(t), (18)\nh\u2212\ni(t) =/summationdisplay\nj\u2208\u2126/I(t,t\u2032))Jij\u03c3j(t).\n7\nThe annealed approximation consists in considering the local \ufb01elds as random variables,\ncorrelated to the previous story of the system only through the v alue ofq(t,t\u2032). In this spirit,\nwe consider a dynamics in which the local \ufb01elds are extracted at rand om at every time step,\nunder the following assumptions:\n1. The local \ufb01elds at di\ufb00erent points are independent random variab les;\n2. The value of \u03c3j(t) is independent on the synaptic coupling Jij.\nBoth these assumptions have troubles when the synaptic couplings are correlated with\neach other, but they are quite reasonable for \u03b7= 0, which is the case that we are studying\nnow. Assumption 1 implies that the transition probability is a binomial on e:\nPr{q(t+1,t\u2032+1) =qn|q(t,t\u2032) =qm}=/parenleftBiggN\nn/parenrightBigg\n(\u03b3(qm))n(1\u2212\u03b3(qm))N\u2212n,(19)\nwhereqn=n/N, and\u03b3(q) is the probability that |\u02dch+(q)|>|\u02dch\u2212(1\u2212q)|, where, following\nassumption 2, \u02dch\u00b1(q) is a Gaussian variable with mean value zero and variance q(this result\nis independent on the details of the distribution of the couplings, pro vided that they are all\nindependent variables with mean value zero and with the same varianc e). A straightforward\ncomputation shows that\n\u03b3(q) =2\n\u03c0arcsin\u221aq. (20)\nThe Markov process associated to this transition probability is ergo dic if we exclude as\nstarting points the values q= 0 and q= 1, as we do imposing the opening condition, and\nthe distribution of the distance evolves towards a stationary distr ibution. Moreover, since\nthe transition probability is independent on l=t\u2032\u2212t, also the stationary distribution is\nindependent on l, which appears only in the initial distribution of the variable q(0,l). It is\nalso evident from the symmetry of the problem that it must hold \u03b3(q) = 1\u2212\u03b3(1\u2212q), so, if\nalso the initial distribution is symmetric ( e.g.a binomial distribution around q= 1/2), the\noverlap distribution will be symmetric at every time step and it will be co ncentrated around\nthe value Q(t,t\u2032) =D(t,t\u2032) = 1/2 (the distributions of the overlap and of the distance are\nperfectly equivalent in this case). The stationary distribution is, ind ependently on the initial\none, concentrated around the value Q\u2217solution of the self-consistent equation:\nQ\u2217=\u03b3(Q\u2217) =2\n\u03c0arcsin/radicalBig\nQ\u2217. (21)\nThis equation has three solutions: 1 /2, 1 and 0, but only the \ufb01rst one can be accepted,\naccordingtothecriterion |\u03b3\u2032(Q\u2217)|<1, whichcanbeobtainedeitherasthestabilitycondition\nof the \ufb01xed point Q\u2217of the map Q(t+1,t\u2032+1) =\u03b3(Q(t,t\u2032)), or as the condition that the\nvariance of the stationary distribution is positive (see equation (25 ) below).\nEquation (21) is equivalent to the equation for the stationary value of the correlation\nfunction rigorously derived in [6] through a functional integral app roach, so that one can\nsee from this comparison that the annealed approximation gives an e xact (though trivial)\nresult concerning the average overlap. But our task here is to com pute the whole stationary\n8\ndistribution of the overlap, and we can not prove that the annealed approximation is correct\nto this extent, so we have to rely upon simulations to control its valid ity.\nThough it is concentrated around Q\u2217= 1/2, the stationary distribution is much broader\nthan a binomial one and thus the closing probability is exponentially larg er than 1 /2N. In\norder to compute its value, we proceed in this way [14]: since the tran sition probability is\nexponentially concentrated, we look for a solution of the form:\nPN(q(t,t\u2032) =qn) =CN(qn,t)exp(\u2212N\u03b1t(qn)), (22)\nwhere we have dropped the ldependence of the probability, which disappears at stationarity.\nUsing Stirling approximation for the binomial coe\ufb03cient and the saddle point approximation\nto average over the distribution at time step t\u22121, we get the following equation for the\nevolution of the exponent of the distribution, \u03b1t(x):\n\u03b1t(x) =\u03b1t\u22121(qt(x))+xlog/parenleftBiggx\n\u03b3(qt(x))/parenrightBigg\n+(1\u2212x)log/parenleftBigg1\u2212x\n1\u2212\u03b3(qt(x))/parenrightBigg\n,(23)\nwhere the function qt(x) must be determined self consistently solving the equation\n\u03b1\u2032\nt\u22121(qt(x))\u2212\u03b3\u2032(qt(x))/parenleftBiggx\n\u03b3(qt(x))\u22121\u2212x\n1\u2212\u03b3(qt(x))/parenrightBigg\n, (24)\nwith the conditions qt(x)>0 andqt(x)<1.\nAt stationarity the most probable overlap (the point where \u03b1t(q) has a minimum) is\ngiven by equation (21), and the variance of the distribution can be o btained taking the\nsecond derivative of equation (23) and solving it together with the \ufb01 rst derivative of the\nsaddle point condition (24). The result is\nV\u2217=Q\u2217(1\u2212Q\u2217)\n1\u2212(\u03b3\u2032(Q\u2217))2=1/4\n1\u2212(2/\u03c0)2\u22480.4204, (25)\nwhereV\u2217is the variance of the stationary distribution multiplied times N. Thus the vari-\nance is larger than in the case of a binomial distribution, since the dyn amics has produced\ncorrelations between di\ufb00erent elements.\nThevalueoftheclosingprobabilitycannotbecomputedanalytically: w eneedforthisthe\nwholefunction \u03b1(x), andtoobtainitweshouldsolveatranscendent nonlocalequation . Thus\nwe had to solve numerically equation (23), obtaining the stationary d istribution reported in\nFigure 1. The asymptotic closing probability, de\ufb01ned as P\u2217\nN(q= 1)+P\u2217\nN(q= 0), is thus\n\u03c0\u2217\nN= 2exp(\u03b1N), (26)\nwith\u03b1= 0.4554. As discussed in the previous section, the exponent of the av erage length of\nthe cycles should be equal to \u03b1/2. This prediction is in good agreement with the numerical\nsimulations that will be reported in section 4.\n2.4 Initial distribution\nIn order to compute the average number of cycles we have to know the distribution of the\noverlapwiththeinitialcon\ufb01guration, q(0,l), whichplaystheroleoftheinitialdistributionfor\n9\nthe stochastic process studied in the previous subsection. Althou gh the number of cycles in\nfullyasymmetric neural networks wasalreadyexactly studied bySc hreckenberg [11], wewant\nto sketch the annealed computation of it, since it is much simpler and it can be generalized\nto more complex situations.\nOur aim is to compute the distribution of q(0,l). After one time step the annealed\napproximation is exact (we have still to extract all the couplings) an d trivial: every spin\ncan be either in its initial state or in the reversed one with probability 1 /2, and the overlap\nq(0,1) multiplied times Nhas a binomial distribution with p= 1/2. After two time steps\nwe distinguish two contributions in the local \ufb01eld: one coming from the setI1of the spins\nwhich are in the same state at t= 0 and at t= 1 and another one coming from all the other\nspins. We write\n\u03c3i(0)\u03c3i(2) = sign\uf8eb\n\uf8ed/summationdisplay\nj\u2208I1\u03c3i(0)Jij\u03c3j(0)\u2212/summationdisplay\nj\u2208\u2126/I1\u03c3i(0)Jij\u03c3j(0)\uf8f6\n\uf8f8. (27)\nSince the states \u03c3i(0) and\u03c3j(0) are independent both one on each other and on the cou-\nplings, wecansetthemequal to1. Ifwechangethesignofthelast s um, weobtain \u03c3i(0)\u03c3i(1).\nThus, depending on whether this is positive or negative, there are t wo possibilities:\n\u03c3i(0)\u03c3i(2) =\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3sign/parenleftbigg/parenleftBig/summationtext\nj\u2208I1Jij/parenrightBig2\u2212/parenleftBig/summationtext\nj\u2208\u2126/I1Jij/parenrightBig2/parenrightbigg\n, if \u03c3 i(0)\u03c3i(1)>0\nsign/parenleftbigg/parenleftBig/summationtext\nj\u2208\u2126/I1Jij/parenrightBig2\u2212/parenleftBig/summationtext\nj\u2208I1Jij/parenrightBig2/parenrightbigg\n, if \u03c3 i(0)\u03c3i(1)<0(28)\n(there is indeed in this formula a small imprecision, which becomes neglig ible in the in\ufb01nite\nsize limit: since the coupling Jiiis set equal to zero, we have not to take into account the spin\nj=iitself, which contributes to the \ufb01rst sum in both lines). The probabilit y that the sum\nofnGaussian variables has a module larger than that of the sum of N\u2212nother Gaussian\nvariables was already computed in the previous section, where it rec eived the name \u03b3(n/N).\nTaking all this into account, we come to the transition probability\nPr{q(0,2) =m/N|q(0,1) =n/N}= (29)\n=/summationdisplay\nk/parenleftBiggn\nk/parenrightBigg/parenleftBiggN\u2212n\nm\u2212k/parenrightBigg\n(\u03b3(n/N))N\u2212n\u2212m+2k(1\u2212\u03b3(n/N))n+m\u22122k,\nwhere, as usual, the opening condition imposes to exclude as startin g points n= 0 and\nn=N, and the sum runs over all the values of kfor which the factorial is well de\ufb01ned.\nThe closing probability which can be deduced from this formula setting eitherm=Nor\nm= 0 coincides with the one exactly computed in ref. [11]. It can be easily seen that it is\nproportional to 1 /2N, as expected (the system loses memory of the initial con\ufb01guration quite\nfast), and the proportionality coe\ufb03cient can be computed with the saddle point method [11]\nIn the general case, the information about q(0,l) is not enough to compute the distribu-\ntion ofq(0,l+1): we have also to know the value of q(0,1), as it can be seen from equation\n(28) where we have to substitute 1 with land 2 with l+1 in the equations but we have to\nkeep memory of \u03c3i(0)\u03c3i(1) in the conditions. In the general case the transition probability\nhas thus the form\n10\nPr{q(0,l+1) =m/N|q(0,1) =n1/N,q(0,l) =n/N}= (30)\n=/summationdisplay\nk/parenleftBiggn1\nk/parenrightBigg/parenleftBiggN\u2212n1\nm\u2212k/parenrightBigg\n(\u03b3(n/N))N\u2212n1\u2212m+2k(1\u2212\u03b3(n/N))n1+m\u22122k,\nand we have to consider the evolution of the joint distribution of the variables q(0,1) and\nq(0,l). As expected, the correlations between these two variables van ish very fast as lgrows,\nand the stationary distribution is the product of two binomial distrib utions, as it can be\neasily checked, so that for large lthe closing probability is \u03c0(a)\nN(0,l) = 1/2N(withaequal\neither to 1 or to 0), consistently with the supposed loss of memory a nd in agreement with\nthe exact results of ref [11]. For small values of lit can be seen that \u03c0(a)\nN(0,l) =cl/2N, where\nclgoes to a \ufb01nite value in the in\ufb01nite size limit, so that the total number o f cycles increases\nonly proportionally to system size.\n3 Reversal symmetry\nThe computations shown in section 2.2 must be modi\ufb01ed to take into ac count the twofold\nnature of the closing probability. We have to distinguish between two kinds of cycles, with\ndi\ufb00erent properties under the reversal operation:\n1. Cycles that close when C(t+l) =RC(t) (or, in other words, q(t,t+l) = 0), whose\nlength is 2 l. They are invariant under the reversal operation: each con\ufb01gur ation is\npresent together with its reversed one.\n2. Cycles that close when q(t,t+l) = 1. In this case the reversal operator applied to the\ncycle \u0393 produces a new cycle R\u0393 with equal length and equally large attraction basin.\nTaking this into account, we have to distinguish between cycles of ev en length, which\ncan be of one of the two kinds, and cycles of odd length, which can be only of the \ufb01rst kind.\nCycle length distribution is then\nPr{T=t,L=l}=1\n2\u03c42exp/parenleftBigg\n\u2212(t+l)2\n2\u03c42/parenrightBigg\n, lodd; (31)\n=1\n2\u03c42exp/parenleftBigg\n\u2212(t+l)2\n2\u03c42/parenrightBigg\n+1\n2\u03c42exp/parenleftBigg\n\u2212(t+l/2)2\n2\u03c42/parenrightBigg\n, leven,(32)\nwith\u03c4= 1/\u221a\u03c0\u2217= 1/\u221a\n2exp(0.2277N).\nThe cycles of the \ufb01rst type have only even length, so that their num ber is half of the\nnumber of the cycles of the second type. Using the result of subse ction 2.2 and summing up\nthe contributions of both types of cycles we obtain, at the leading o rder inN,\n/summationdisplay\nl\u221dan}bracketle{tna(l)\u221dan}bracketri}ht \u22483\n2log\u03c4=3\n4\u03b1N, (33)\n11\nwhich is 3 /2 times larger than in a Random Map with the same closing probability.\nThe most important di\ufb00erence between attractors in Asymmetric N eural Networks and\nin a Random Map involves the distribution of the attraction basins weig hts. Let us consider\nseparately cycles of the \ufb01rst type and cycles of the second type ( taking only one cycle to\nrepresent each pair of cycles of the second type). We then get th e expression of the moments\n\u221dan}bracketle{tYn\u221dan}bracketri}htof the distribution of the weights:\n\u221dan}bracketle{tYn\u221dan}bracketri}ht=1\n2/angbracketleftBigg/summationdisplay\n\u03b1\u2032Wn\n\u03b1\u2032+2/summationdisplay\n\u03b1\u2032\u2032(W\u03b1\u2032\u2032/2)n/angbracketrightBigg\n, (34)\nwhere the sum over \u03b1\u2032and\u03b1\u2032\u2032of the weights are both normalized to one. Under the hypoth-\nesis that each of the two sets of weights is distributed as in a Random Map, we get\n\u221dan}bracketle{tYn\u221dan}bracketri}ht=/parenleftbigg1\n2+1\n2n/parenrightbigg\n\u221dan}bracketle{tYn\u221dan}bracketri}htRM, (35)\nor, using (10),\n\u221dan}bracketle{tYn+1\u221dan}bracketri}ht=1\n2(n!)2\n(2n+1)!(4n+2n). (36)\nThusthemomentsofthedistributionoftheweightsaresmaller than intheusualRandom\nMap, for instance \u221dan}bracketle{tY2\u221dan}bracketri}ht= 1/2 instead of 2/3. These results are in very good agreement with\nnumerical simulations.\nTo prove equation (35) let us recall that \u221dan}bracketle{tYn\u221dan}bracketri}htcan be interpreted as the probability that\nnrandomly chosen trajectories reach the same attractor. We can compute such quantity\nusing the closing probabilities and following exactly the same lines as in [19 ], but we have to\nremember that a closing event has two di\ufb00erent meanings: either a c losure on an identical\ncon\ufb01guration ( q= 1) or a closure on a reversed con\ufb01guration ( q= 0). Thus not all the\nevents which represent the closure of the ntrajectories, and whose probability is exactly\n\u221dan}bracketle{tYn\u221dan}bracketri}htRM, have the meaning that the trajectories will ultimately meet. If the \ufb01rst trajectory\ncloses with q= 0 (this happens with probability 1/2), its attraction basin contains also all of\nthe reversed con\ufb01gurations, and the following n\u22121 trajectories which close on it will then go\nto the same attractor, regardless on how they close. On the cont rary, if the \ufb01rst trajectory\ncloses with q= 1, the following n\u22121 trajectories have also to close with q= 1 in order to\ngo to the same attraction basin (if they close with q= 0, they go to the reversed basin).\nIn this case, whose probability is again 1 /2, a closing event is equivalent to an asymptotic\nmeeting of the ntrajectories only with probability 1 /2n\u22121. Equation (35) is thus proved.\n3.1 Explicit symmetry breaking\nThe above picture of the distribution of the attraction basins weigh ts is completely destroyed\nby the introduction of a magnetic \ufb01eld, however small, in the equation s of motion (1), which\nrestores the distribution typical of a Random Map. We considered t he dynamic rules\n\u03c3i(t+1) = sign\uf8eb\n\uf8ed/summationdisplay\njJij\u03c3j(t)\u2212h\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 (37)\n12\nThe magnetic \ufb01eld hhas the biological meaning of the threshold of activation of the\nneurons. In real neurons, such non-zero threshold exists and c an be di\ufb00erent from one\nneuron to another one. In our simpli\ufb01ed model, we take a threshold w hich is constant\namong the di\ufb00erent neurons. Its introduction explicitly breaks the symmetry respect to the\nreversal of all the neural activities.\nIn the framework of the annealed approximation, the conditional p robability that the\nactivity of a neuron is the same in two di\ufb00erent time steps is not more s ymmetric, i.e.\n\u03b3(1\u2212q) is di\ufb00erent from 1 \u2212\u03b3(q) and\u03b3(1) increases very fast respect to the above case,\nthus making very unlikely a reversed closure, while \u03b3(0) decreases. After a straightforward\ncalculation we get\n\u03b3(q) = 1\u22122\n\u03c0/integraldisplay\u03c0/2\narcsin\u221aqexp/parenleftbigg\n\u22121\n2(h/sint)2/parenrightbigg\ndt. (38)\nFor large threshold the closing probability di\ufb00ers from 1 by a value tha t cancels very fast,\nas exp(\u2212h2/2).\nThe attractors of the \ufb01rst type (such that \u0393 = R\u0393) are completely destroyed in this way,\nwhile attractors of the second type do not live in pairs anymore, and the distribution of the\nweights is of the Random Map type.\n4 Numerical results\n4.1 Distribution of the overlap and closing probabilities\nOur \ufb01rst aim was to compare the distribution of the overlap predicte d by the annealed\napproximation with the same distribution in the quenched system. As we wrote, the analogy\nholds if we measure the overlap between con\ufb01gurations only along th e trajectories that\nare not yet closed when we do the measurement. Under this conditio n, we computed the\ndistribution of the overlap q(t,t+l) forl\ufb01xed and tlarge enough to suppose that the\ndistribution has attained stationarity.\nThe exponent \u03b1(q) of the distribution of the overlap is de\ufb01ned by the equation PN(q) =\nCN(q)exp(\u2212N\u03b1(q)), wherethefactor CN(q), proportionalto1 /\u221a\nN, comes fromtheStirling\nexpansion of the binomial coe\ufb03cient. Thus we computed \u03b1(q) using the formula\n\u03b1(q) =\u22121\nN/parenleftbigg\nlog(PN(q))+1\n2logN/parenrightbigg\n. (39)\nThe logarithmic term must not be subtracted when qis equal to 0 or 1, because in this\ncase the 1 /\u221a\nNfactor is no more present in the expansion of the binomial coe\ufb03cient , and\nso we did not consider it for q= 0 and 1, interpolating linearly between the two formulas\nfor values of qbetween 0 and 0 .1 and between 0 .9 and 1. In such data analysis we neglect\nterms of order 1 /N(there is also an unknown coe\ufb03cient in the expression of the probab ility\nP(q)), and the agreement between the annealed prediction for \u03b1(q) and the quenched data,\ncompared in Figure 1, is then very satisfactory even for a system o f such a small size (we\nconsidered N= 20). When l, the temporal distance between con\ufb01gurations, is small, there\naresomediscrepancies (forinstance, for l= 2thequencheddistributionismuchbroaderthan\nexpected, and the closing probability is consequently much higher), but when lis large the\n13\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\nq0.00.10.20.30.40.5\u03b1(q)l=2\nl=32\nFigure 1: Exponent \u03b1(q)computed from the equation PN(q) =CN(q)exp(\u2212N\u03b1(q)), where\nPN(q)is the stationary overlap distribution, with both q=q(t,t+ 2)(diamonds) and q=\nq(t,t+32)(triangles). The solid line shows the annealed prediction. The agreement is better\nin the second case, when the temporal distance between con\ufb01g urations is larger. System size\nisN= 20andh= 0.\nagreement improves (in particular, the variance of the distribution and the exponents \u03b1(0)\nand\u03b1(1) of the closing probabilities coincide within the errors with the pred icted values).\nThis fact sustains our interpretation that the annealed approxima tion is valid when the\ntemporal distance is large, so that the system has lost memory of t he details of its evolution\n[14, 21].\nNext we measured the closing probability \u03c0N(t,t+l). Figure 2 represents this quantity\nas a function of tfor di\ufb00erent values of l, kept \ufb01xed. The statistic errors are large, but it\nappears that \u03c0(t,t+l) reaches a value approximately stationary in t, in agreement with\nthe annealed prediction, when lis large (in \ufb01gure 2b we have l= 11) but when lis small\n(in \ufb01gure 2a l= 2) the closing probability reaches a maximum value and then decreas es,\nas a function of t. We already observed this kind of non monotonic behavior of the clos ing\nprobabilities in simulations of Kau\ufb00man model. In both cases we interpr et the decreasing\npart of\u03c0(t) as due to the opening condition: the condition that the trajector y is not closed\nup to time tselects, as tgrows, trajectories which are more and more unlikely to close.\n14\n0 20 40 60\nt0e+001e\u2212042e\u2212043e\u2212044e\u2212045e\u221204\u03c0(t,t+11)\n0 20 40 60 80\nt0e+002e\u2212044e\u2212046e\u221204\u03c0(t,t+2)\n(b) (a)\nFigure 2: Closing probability \u03c0N(t,t+l)as a function of t, forl= 2(a) andl= 11(b).\nSystem size is N= 20withh= 0.\nThe opening condition cannot be imposed in the annealed scheme, bec ause we consider the\nstochastic process d(t,t+l) withl\ufb01xed and we cannot control d(t,t\u2032) for generic tand\nt\u2032. So the annealed scheme must be modi\ufb01ed to take into account this f act [14]. But in\nasymmetric neural networks, di\ufb00erently from what we observed in Kau\ufb00man networks, the\nopening condition seems to be irrelevant when the temporal distanc elis large, and the\nclosing probability appears to reach in this case an approximately sta tionary value.\nThe non-stationarity of the distribution of q(t,t+ 2) shows the existence of memory\ne\ufb00ects in the model: the statistical properties of q(t,t+ 2) still depend on t, even after\nan arbitrarily long transient time. It would be interesting to \ufb01nd out w hether the lack of\ntime translation invariance in the system with completely uncorrelate d couplings has some\nrelation with aging in the relaxational dynamics of the SK spin glass mod el [22]. In the\npresent case, however, the lack of time translation invariance is on ly a minor e\ufb00ect and\ndoes not prevent the overlap q(t,t+l) from reaching a stationary distribution for llarge\nenough. The macroscopic properties of the dynamics can be predic ted, in good agreement\nwith numerical results, also neglecting this e\ufb00ect at all.\nWe conclude this subsection showing a plot of the integral closing pro bability \u02dc\u03c0N(t),\n15\n0.0 20.0 40.0 60.0 80.0\nt0.0000.0050.0100.015\u03c0N\nFigure 3: Integral closing probability, \u03c0N(t) =/summationtext\nt\u2032\u03c0N(t\u2032,t)as a function of tin a system of\nsize 20 with h= 0\nde\ufb01ned as\n\u02dc\u03c0N(t) =t\u22121/summationdisplay\nt\u2032=0\u03c0N(t\u2032,t) (40)\nthis is the probability that a trajectory not closed at time t\u22121 closes at time t).

On the other hand, from the annealed approximation we would\nexpect ittoincrease linearlywith tinthestationarystate. Inasymmetric neuralnetworks we\nfound that the integral closing probability increases monotonically w itht.

So, at least for systems of not very large size, deviations from t he\nannealed approximation are present also in this case.\n16\n10 20 30 40\nN0.00.10.20.30.40.5<Yn>\nFigure 4: Moments of the distribution of the attraction basin weights versus system size N\nforh= 0:\u221dan}bracketle{tY2\u221dan}bracketri}ht(diamonds); \u221dan}bracketle{tY2\n2\u221dan}bracketri}ht(squares); \u221dan}bracketle{tY3\u221dan}bracketri}ht(triangles) and \u221dan}bracketle{tY4\u221dan}bracketri}ht(stars).

For every value of the parameters Nandh= 0 we generated\nat random 2000 networks, extracting the synaptic couplings with G aussian distribution, and\nwe simulated four randomly chosen trajectories on each of them.\nThe average weight of the basins, \u221dan}bracketle{tY2\u221dan}bracketri}ht, was estimated from the probability that two\ndi\ufb00erent trajectories end up on the same periodic orbit.

Its value \u03b1L/2 = 0.224 is in good agreement with the prediction of the annealed\napproximation, \u03b1/2 = 0.228 (the small discrepancy could be a \ufb01nite size e\ufb00ect, as the expo-\nnent estimated from numerical data increases when only the larges t systems are considered).\nFigure 5 shows the average length of the cycles versus system size .\nThe distribution of cycle length is much broader than it is expected on the basis of the\nannealed approximation, and asymptotically behaves as a stretche d exponential:\nPr{L > l} \u2248exp(\u2212(l/\u03c4N)\u03b3N). (41)\nAs discussed in the previous sections, the distribution is di\ufb00erent fo r the two di\ufb00erent\ntypes of cycles. We considered only odd cycles, in order to select on ly attractors of the\nsecond type, and we checked that the scale of the distribution, \u03c4N, increases exponentially\nwithN,\u03c4N\u221dexp(\u03b1P/2N), where the exponent \u03b1Pcoincides with \u03b1Lwithin the errors.\nOn the other hand the exponent \u03b3Nof the stretched exponential, for which the annealed\napproximation predicts the value 2, is instead less than 1 for all of th e system sizes that we\nexamined, but it appears to increase slightly as Ngrows (though are data about this point\nare very noisy), so that it is possible that this discrepancy shall disa ppear in the in\ufb01nite size\n18\nlimit.\nThe fact that we \ufb01nd \u03b3Nless than 1 appears challenging also because the distribution\nof the closing time ( i.e.the sum of the transient time plus the length of the cycle), which\nshould have the same behavior of the distribution of cycle length, ac cording to the annealed\napproximation, is indeed much steeper: it can be \ufb01tted to a stretch ed exponential of the\nsame form (41), but with a much larger exponent \u03b3\u2032\nN. For instance, for N= 20, we \ufb01nd\n\u03b3\u2032\nN= 1.9, in good agreement with the annealed prediction, while the value of \u03b3Nis 0.69.\n4.3 Properties of attractors: broken symmetry\nWhen we consider the evolution equation (37) with a threshold h, the reversal symmetry\nis explicitly broken and the distribution of the weights is the same as in t he usual Random\nMap.\nFigure 6 shows the behavior of the \ufb01rst moments of the distribution of the weights as a\nfunction of system size Nforh= 0.1. Such threshold is so small that it modi\ufb01es the value\nof the exponent \u03b1by less than 2 percent. The annealed approximation predicts in this c ase\n\u03b1= 0.448, to be compared to the value 0 .455 found with zero threshold. The prediction is\nin good agreement with numerical simulations: a \ufb01t of the average len gth of the cycles gives\n\u03b1L= 0.44. For such a small threshold we can observe traces of the broke n symmetry present\nas \ufb01nite size e\ufb00ects: the moments of the distribution at small Nfall below the Random\nMap values, even if of a very small amount, and then increase to tho se values, which are\nmaintained asymptotically in system size.\nOn the other hand, when the threshold is larger, we do not see at all the signs of the\nsymmetry on the distribution: for h= 1, the average basin weight decreases monotonically\nfrom the value 1 at small Ntoward the Random Map value \u221dan}bracketle{tY2\u221dan}bracketri}ht= 2/3. For such a threshold\ntheaveragelengthofthecyclesstillbehaves exponentiallywith N, buttheexponent \u03b1isvery\nsmall and power law corrections have important e\ufb00ects also for sys tems large to simulate,\nas it appears from the fact that the best \ufb01t exponent depends sig ni\ufb01cantly on system size\n(it decrease as system size increases), and we could not estimate it accurately. Nevertheless,\nthe agreement between the annealed approximation, which predict s\u03b1= 0.128, and the\nnumerical result \u03b1L= 0.15, is worse than in the previous cases but still not bad.\n5 Summary and conclusions\nIn this work we used a stochastic scheme, based on the closing prob abilities and on their ap-\nproximation by means of a Markovian stochastic process, in order t o compute the properties\nof the attractors in fully asymmetric neural networks. The funda mental hypothesis behind\nthis approximation is that the system forgets fast enough the det ails of its past evolution,\nso that a one step memory is already enough to describe the gross f eatures of the dynamics.\nOur method is able to predict very satisfactorily the Nbehavior of the typical lengths of the\ncycles and typical transient times, the number of cycles, the distr ibution of their attraction\nbasin weights and also the main features of the distribution of the dis tances. On the other\nhand, the approximation fails to predict the shape of the distributio n of cycle length, which\nis much broader than we would expect.\n19\n0 10 20 30\nN0.40.60.8<Yn>\nFigure 6: Moments of the distribution of the attraction basin weights versus system size N\nforh= 0.1. :\u221dan}bracketle{tY2\u221dan}bracketri}ht(diamonds); \u221dan}bracketle{tY2\n2\u221dan}bracketri}ht(squares); \u221dan}bracketle{tY3\u221dan}bracketri}ht(triangles) and \u221dan}bracketle{tY4\u221dan}bracketri}ht(stars). The dotted\nlines show the predictions of the annealed approximation.\n20\nThe average number of cycles had already been exactly computed, and perhaps other\nquantities can be exactly computed in this model, but the present me thod has the advan-\ntage of being very simple, and we hope that it can be applied to more co mplex situations.\nIn particular with this method we argue that the distribution of attr action basins is, for\ndisordered dynamical systems that are \u201cchaotic enough\u201d, always equal to the one computed\nby Derrida and Flyvbjerg for the case of an uniform Random Map [19].\nA possible extension of our method, that we consider very interest ing and that we plan\nto pursue further, is towards the study of neural networks with \ufb01nite symmetry. Numerical\nstudies suggest that such systems undergo an abrupt change of dynamical regime when the\nsymmetry \u03b7is changed [9], but a \u201cmean \ufb01eld\u201d description of this transition from an ordered\nbehavior to chaos is still lacking. The possibility that such a change ca n be characterized as\na transition between memory and loss of memory is very appealing. Me mory e\ufb00ects are more\nandmoreimportantfornetworkswithnon-zerocouplingsymmetry (tillthewell-known aging\npropertiesoftheSKmodelareapproached). Becauseofthesee \ufb00ects, itisnecessarytomodify\nour method also to study the chaotic regime of the model (low symme try). Technically this\nis not an easy task, since for non zero symmetry correlations arise both between the local\n\ufb01elds (see equations (18)) of di\ufb00erent neurons and, more di\ufb03cult t o treat, between synaptic\ncouplings and dynamical variables. The latter introduce an e\ufb00ective interaction between the\nstate of an element at two di\ufb00erent time steps tandt+ 2, so that in the dynamics also\nan e\ufb00ective gradient \ufb02ow is present, and, if the annealed approxima tion can describe this\nsituation, it will be necessary to take into account also this informat ion, aside the crude\ndistance, to make the annealed scheme useful.\nStudying this family of models it is also possible, varying the continuous parameters \u03b7\nandh, to go from the distribution of the attraction basins typical of the Random Map to\nthe one typical of Spin Glasses, thus the study of the general mod el would shed some light\non the relation between the two kinds of distributions.\nMemory e\ufb00ects are probably responsible of the discrepancy betwe en the prediction of the\nannealed approximation and the observed distribution of cycle lengt h. In fact, the distance\nd(t,t\u2032)doesnotreachastationarydistribution, ifwe imposethecondition thatthetrajectory\nis not yet closed before the measure. We think that this condition, w hich can not be imposed\nin our computation, selects trajectories that are less and less likely to close. As a result,\nthe integral closing probability, which is our main tool in the computat ion, increases as a\nfunction of tslower than expected. It is possible that this e\ufb00ect shows up only at smallland\ndisappears in the in\ufb01nite size limit (an hint of this could be the fact that the distribution\nof cycle length decays faster in this limit), but it is also possible that, a s in the case of\nKau\ufb00man model that we previously studied, some corrections to th e annealed picture are\nnecessary also in the in\ufb01nite size limit. However, we think that these r esults show that the\nannealed approximation is an useful tool to investigate in a simple way the properties of\nattractors in disordered dynamical systems.\nAcknowledgments\nWe are indebted to Angelo Vulpiani for addressing us to this model.

They demonstrated\nthat when the number of characters a\ufb00ected is greater than two , the long-time steady\nstate solution of their model can have a nonzero fraction of the po pulation with\nidentical alleles, and that this phenomenon does not occur if the num ber of characters\na\ufb00ected per gene is two or fewer.\nIn this paper we consider their model and a simple variant of it, addre ssing several\nissues. The \ufb01rst three issues involve the mathematical analysis of t he theory. First\nwe study the time evolution of the distribution of alleles. In the model, the initial\ndistribution of alleles is continuous, and at in\ufb01nite time there is an in\ufb01nit ely narrow\n(\u03b4-function) peak;2we ask how the distribution of alleles depends on time at long\nbut \ufb01nite times. Second, we describe how to construct time-depen dent solutions by\nusing an expansion in a sum of functions (Gaussians) particularly pick ed to meet\nthe requirements of this problem. Third, we examine the relationship between the\nmodel with discrete generations used by Waxman and Peck (where m utations occur\nat discrete times, and \ufb01tness selection occurs continuously) and a continuous-time\nmodel in which both mutations and \ufb01tness selection occur continuou sly. The latter is\na limiting case of the discrete model arising when the time between gen erations gets\nvery short. We demonstrate that the qualitative behavior of the t wo models is the\nsame, but that dependence of the behavior on the parameters ca n be di\ufb00erent in the\ntwo models.\nWe show that the population genetics models can be mapped onto pro blems in\nquantum mechanics, speci\ufb01cally Bose-Einstein condensation3(de Groot et al., 1950)\nand motion of a particle in a central potential.4The mapping onto Bose condensation\nis performed on the discrete-time model in the limit that the \ufb01tness s election is\nvery strong so that only organisms with \ufb01tnesses very near optimu m survive each\n1Waxman and Peck\u2019s model is based on the continuum-of-alleles model of (Kimura, 1965). Other\nimportant investigations of pleiotropic models include (Wagner, 1989 ), (Lande, 1980), (Gavrilets &\nde Jong, 1993), and (Turelli, 1985).\n2The Dirac delta-function, \u03b4(t), is de\ufb01ned to be a function very sharply peaked around t= 0, but\nhaving a total weight/integraltext\ndt\u03b4(t) equal to one. One de\ufb01nition of such a function is the limit as zgoes\nto positive in\ufb01nity of (2 \u03c0z)\u22121/2exp[\u2212t2/(2z)]. We shall deal with variables /vector xwithNcomponents.\nFor such variables, \u03b4(/vector x) is de\ufb01ned to be a delta function in the \ufb01rst component of /vector x, times one in\nthe second component, .... In this way, one has/integraltext\ndNx \u03b4(/vector x) = 1.(Spanier & Oldham, 1987)\n3Bose-Einstein condensation in three dimensions is discussed in many t exts on statistical me-\nchanics, e.g., (Feynman, 1972).\n4See any book on quantum mechanics, e.g., (Schi\ufb00, 1968).\n2\ngeneration. The mapping onto the quantum particle in a central pot ential applies\nmore generally. The simplest case has the potential independent of time. This case\ncorresponds to the a limit of the population model in which \ufb01tness sele ction and\nmutations both occur continuously. The close relation between the continuous-time\npopulation biology models and Schr\u00a8 odinger\u2019s equation has been explo ited by B\u00a8 urger5\ntoobtainmanygeneral resultsonthelong-timebehavior ofmodelso fthetypestudied\nhere. In this paper, we focus on the mapping for a speci\ufb01c model, wh ich yields a\nsimple physical interpretation of the emergence of a unique genoty pe, and allows\nthe extraction of the time-dependence of the \ufb01tness peak as well as comparison to\nthe discrete-time model. We \ufb01nd that the behavior is qualitatively iden tical when\nthe mutations are continuous and when they are discrete, though there are some\nquantitative di\ufb00erences.\nWe also discuss our attempts to relate the results fromthis model t o the statistical\nproperties of the sequences that are archived in various sequenc e databases. We\nanalyze thestatistical properties ofgene sequences tabulated in genetic databases and\nattempt to correlate observed variations with estimates of the de gree of pleiotropy of\ndi\ufb00erent genes in the databases. The results of these attempts a re inconclusive.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we introduce the theo retical\nmodels. Section 3 presents our analysis of the time evolution of the d iscrete version\nof the model, demonstrating that the behavior can be extracted a nalytically in a\nlimit in which the typical jump caused by mutations is very large. In sec tion 4 we\npresent our analysis of the continuous-time model. Section 5 conta ins remarks on the\nrelationshipbetween thecontinuous- anddiscrete-time models. Se ction6presents our\nexamination of DNA sequence archives and our attempts to correla te the statistics of\ndocumented sequence variations to the degree of pleiotropy of va rious genes. Section\n7 recaps our main conclusions. The Appendix contains mathematical details of the\nanalysis of the time-dependence of the continuous-time model aime d at establishing\nthe long-time time-dependence.\n2 The Models\nOnemodel we study is that of (Waxman& Peck, 1998). In this model, the population\nis in\ufb01nite, the phenotypic variation is continuous, each gene a\ufb00ects Ncharacters, and\nthe e\ufb00ects of di\ufb00erent genes are uncorrelated (no linkage disequilib rium or epistasis).\nThe model assumes a very large population of haploid and asexual or ganisms with\ndiscrete generations. Let /vector xbe a continuous vector with Ncomponents which rep-\nresents characters which determine the viability of an organism, an d\u03c6(/vector x,t) be the\n5A recent paper with references to previous work is (B\u00a8 urger & Bom ze, 1996).\n3\nnormalized probability density that an organism in the population has t he characters\ngiven by/vector xat timet. The normalization condition for the probability is given by an\nN-dimensional integral as/integraldisplay\n\u03c6(/vector x,t)dNx= 1. (1)\nAt each generation an organism with characters /vector xsurvives viability selection with a\nprobability proportional to exp( \u2212x2/2Vs). This Gaussian \ufb01tness selection will play\nan essential role in our solution of the model. Once each generation, a fraction\u03b8of\nthe population mutates; it is assumed that if a mutation occurs, the n the probability\nthat the mutant takes on the value /vector xgiven the parental value /vector yisf(/vector x\u2212/vector y).\nSince\u03c6(/vector x,t) is a probability density, it is normalized at every time t. Thus, for\nthis model, the equation for the time evolution of \u03c6(/vector x,t) is:\n\u0393(t+1)\u03c6(/vector x,t+1) = (1 \u2212\u03b8)w1(/vector x)\u03c6(/vector x,t)+\u03b8/integraldisplay\nf(/vector x\u2212/vector y)w1(/vector y)\u03c6(/vector y,t)dNy ,(2)\nwhere the \ufb01tness factor w1(/vector x) is\nw1(/vector x) = exp[\u2212x2/2Vs]. (3)\nThe multiplicative factor, \u0393( t+1), in Eq. (2) ensures that the probability, \u03c6(/vector x,t+1)\nis properly normalized at every time step. Integrating Eq. (2) over all/vector xgives the\nWaxman and Peck result for this normalization:\n\u0393(t+1) =/integraldisplay\n\u03c6(/vector x,t)w1(/vector x)dNx . (4)\nWe follow Waxman and Peck in using a Gaussian function for the mutatio n proba-\nbility:\nf(/vector x\u2212/vector y) = (2\u03c0m2)\u2212N/2exp[\u2212(/vector x\u2212/vector y)2/2m2], (5)\nwherem2describes the variance of the mutant e\ufb00ects for a single characte r.\nIn addition to this discrete-time model, we will consider a model in which both\nmutations andselection occur continuously intime. The relationbetw een the discrete\nand continuous-time models can be seen explicitly by noting that the d i\ufb00erential\nequation\n\u2202\u03c6(/vector x,t)\n\u2202t=/bracketleftBigg\na(t)\u2212x2\n2V/bracketrightBigg\n\u03c6(/vector x,t) (6)\nhas the solution\n\u03c6(/vector x,t+\u03c4) = exp/bracketleftBigg/integraldisplayt+\u03c4\ntds a(s)\u2212x2\n2V\u03c4/bracketrightBigg\n\u03c6(/vector x,t).

Here, a(t) is determined by the nor-\nmalization requirement of Eq. (1) and \u03b4(t) is the Dirac delta function. In dynam-\nical systems theory, equations with a sum of time-delta functions a re said to be\n\u2018kicked\u2019(Lichtenberg & Liberman, 1992). When the interval betwee n kicks (here \u03c4)\ngoes to zero, the sum of delta-function is replaced by its time avera ge, so that Eq. (8)\nreduces to:\n\u2202\u03c6(/vector x,t)\n\u2202t=/bracketleftBigg\na(t)\u2212x2\n2V/bracketrightBigg\n\u03c6(/vector x,t)+\u0398/integraldisplay\nd/vector y f(/vector x\u2212/vector y)[\u03c6(/vector y,t)\u2212\u03c6(/vector x,t)],(9)\nwhere \u0398 is the rate of mutations per unit time, \u03b8/\u03c4, anda(t) is determined by the\nnormalization requirement, Eq. (1.)\nIn the next few sections we calculate the evolution of \u03c6(/vector x,t) for di\ufb00erent N, with\nan emphasis on the behavior near /vector x= 0 at long times. In section 3 we examine the\ndiscrete-time model Eq. (2); section 4 discusses the continuous t ime equation Eq. (9).\nIn section 5 we discuss the relationship between the results for the continuous and\ndiscrete-time equations.\n3 Time Evolution of Discrete Equations\nIn this section we consider the discrete-time evolution Eq. (2). We w ill solve it by\nexploiting the following observation. Suppose at some time t \u03c6(/vector x,t) is a normalized\nGaussian with variance \u03b1, so that\u03c6(/vector x,t) =G\u03b1(/vector x), where6\nG\u03b1(/vector x) = (2\u03c0\u03b1)\u2212N/2exp/bracketleftBigg\n\u2212x2\n2\u03b1/bracketrightBigg\n. (10)\nEq. (2) then implies that \u03c6(/vector x,t+ 1) is the sum of two Gaussians. Indeed, at any\n\ufb01nite timet,\u03c6(/vector x,t) is the sum of \ufb01nitely many Gaussians.\nTo see how this works, notice that Eq. (2) involves the processes o f multiplication\nand of convolution with a Gaussian. If one multiplies two Gaussians, on e gets another\nGaussian according to the rule:\nG\u03b1(/vector x)G\u03b2(/vector x) = (\u03b3\n2\u03c0\u03b1\u03b2)N/2G\u03b3(/vector x), where 1 /\u03b3= 1/\u03b1+1/\u03b2 . (11)\n6Strictly speaking, \u03b1is the variance of one component of /vector x.\n5\nConvolution has slightly di\ufb00erent rules. A textbook integration yields the simple\nresult: /integraldisplay\nG\u03b1(/vector x\u2212/vector y)G\u03b2(/vector y)dNy=G\u03b4(/vector x),where\u03b4=\u03b1+\u03b2 . (12)\nInstead of doing integrals at each time step, we can write recursion relations for\nthe evolution of the widths and amplitudes of the Gaussians. We then solve these\nequations in the limit Vs\u226am2. Our method of solution has similarities with that\nused by (Kingman, 1978) on a simpler model.\nTo perform the calculation explicitly, \ufb01rst consider a warm-up proble m\u2014the case\nof no mutations ( \u03b8= 0), which is described by the equation:\n\u0393(t+1)\u03c6(/vector x,t+1) = exp[ \u2212x2/2Vs]\u03c6(/vector x,t), (13)\nwhere \u0393(t+1) is de\ufb01ned in Eq. (4). We assume that, at time t,\u03c6(/vector x,t) is a normalized\nGaussian with variance \u03b1(t):\n\u03c6(/vector x,t) =G\u03b1(t)(/vector x) (14)\nThe multiplication process of Eq. (11) implies that the value of \u03c6(/vector x,t+ 1) is, once\nagain a Gaussian of the form G\u03b1(t+1)(/vector x), but that the new value of \u03b1is given by\n1/\u03b1(t+1) = 1/\u03b1(t)+1/Vs. This equation for \u03b1(t) has the solution:\n\u03b1(t) =\u03b10\n1+\u03b10t/Vs, (15)\nwhere\u03b10=\u03b1(t= 0). Thus the population distribution remains Gaussian, and at\nlong times, its width scales as |/vector x| \u223ct\u22121/2. As expected, \ufb01tness selection continually\nnarrows the distribution.\nNow we examine the full Eq. (2) with \u03b8>0. We \ufb01rst calculate \u03c6(/vector x,t= 1), given\nthat\u03c6(/vector x,t= 0) is a Gaussian. There are two terms in the equation. Each involves\nthe multiplication of Gaussians, and the mutation term also involves a c onvolution.\nBy the rules of Eqs. (11) and (12), \u03c6(/vector x,t= 1) is the sum of two Gaussians of the\nform:\n\u03c6(/vector x,1) = (1\u2212\u03b8)G\u03b21(\u03b1)(/vector x)+\u03b8G\u03b22(\u03b1)(/vector x), (16)\nwhere the two \u03b2\u2019s are given by:\n\u03b21(\u03b1) =\u03b1\n1+\u03b1/Vs, (17)\n\u03b22(\u03b1) =m2+\u03b21(\u03b1), (18)\nIt follows immediately that if \u03c6(/vector x,t) is the sum of \ufb01nitely many Gaussians, then\n\u03c6(/vector x,t+1) is also the sum of \ufb01nitely many Gaussians. Explicitly, we write \u03c6(/vector x,t) in\nthe form:\n\u03c6(/vector x,t) =/summationdisplay\niAi(t)G\u03b1i(t)(/vector x), (19)\n6\nwith the normalization condition that/summationtext\niAi= 1. Then \u03c6(/vector x,t+1) can be written:\n\u0393(t+1)\u03c6(/vector x,t+1) = (1 \u2212\u03b8)/summationdisplay\niBi(t)G\u03b21(\u03b1i(t))(/vector x)+\u03b8/summationdisplay\niBi(t)G\u03b22(\u03b1i(t))(/vector x),(20)\nwith:\nBi(t) =Ai(t)[1+\u03b1i(t)/Vs]\u2212N/2, (21)\n\u0393(t+1) =/summationdisplay\niBi(t). (22)\nEqs. (20-22) simplify considerably when Vs/m2\u226a1. In this case, the character-\nistic width of the mutation probability function, f, is much greater than the width\nproduced by one step of the \ufb01tness narrowing. In this big-mutatio n-jump limit,\n\u03b21(m2)\u2248Vs,\u03b22(m2)\u2248m2,\u03b21(Vs/n) =Vs/(n+1),\u03b22(Vs/n)\u2248m2.7(Here,nis any\npositive integer.)\nConsider the time evolution of an initial distribution consisting of a Gau ssian with\nvariance\u03b1=m2. After one time step, the distribution splits into two Gaussians, an\nunmutated population with variance \u03b2\u2248Vsand a mutated population with variance\n\u03b2\u2248m2. After two time steps, the population consists of three Gaussians with\u03b2\nvalues\u2248m2,Vs, andVs/2. Afternsteps, the population consists of n+1 Gaussians\nwith\u03b2valuesm2,Vs,Vs/2,..., Vs/n. We de\ufb01ne \u03b10=m2,\u03b1i=Vs/ifori\u22651. (Note\nthat these\u03b1\u2019s are time-independent.) If we start with an initial distribution which is\na Gaussian of width much greater than m, then after nsteps, the distribution consists\nofn+ 1 Gaussians with \u03b2values\u03b10, ..., \u03b1 n. We describe the time evolution using\nrate equations for the populations in these states. Fig. 1 is a sketc h of the transitions\nthat can occur between the di\ufb00erent \u03b1\u2019s. Note that at a given time, a state \u03b1imakes\ntransitions to two states, \u03b10and\u03b1i+1.\nWe write\u03c6(/vector x,t) as:\n\u03c6(/vector x,t) =t/summationdisplay\ni=0Ai(t)G\u03b1i(/vector x), (23)\nwhere theAi(t) must obey:.\nA0(t>0) =\u03b8 (24)\nA1(t>0) =(1\u2212\u03b8)\n\u0393(t)QA0(t\u22121), (25)\nAi(t) =1\u2212\u03b8\n\u0393(t)/bracketleftbiggi\u22121\ni/bracketrightbiggN/2\nAi\u22121(t\u22121) (i>1, t>0), (26)\n7Because the newly-mutated population is a Gaussian of width determ ined bym2for any dis-\ntribution, this approximation is equivalent to the \u201chouse-of-cards \u201d approximation introduced by\n(Kingman, 1978) and investigated in (Turelli, 1984), (Barton & Ture lli, 1989). One can show that\nthe results derived in this section are robust when this approximatio n is not made, so long as one is\nthe regime where Vs\u226am2.\n7\nand\n\u0393(t+1) =QA0(t)+t/summationdisplay\ni=1Ai(t)/parenleftbiggi\ni+1/parenrightbiggN/2\n. (27)\nWe have de\ufb01ned Q= (1+m2/Vs)\u2212N/2; note that Q\u226a1 in the limit we consider.\nFirst consider the \ufb01rst two steps of the evolution. Starting with th e initial condi-\ntionA0(t= 0) = 1,Ai(t= 0) = 0, one \ufb01nds:\nA0(t= 1) =\u03b8 ,\nA1(t= 1) = 1 \u2212\u03b8 . (28)\nSo far not much has happened. But a key thing happens at the next step:\nA0(t= 2) =\u03b8 ,\nA1(t= 2) =\u03b8Q(1\u2212\u03b8)\n\u03b8Q+(1\u2212\u03b8)2\u2212N/2,\nA2(t= 2) =(1\u2212\u03b8)22\u2212N/2\n\u03b8Q+(1\u2212\u03b8)2\u2212N/2. (29)\nNote thatA1(t= 2)\u221dQ\u226a1. In fact, for any t >2, allAi\u2019s with 0< i < t are\nproportional to Q. However, as t\u2192 \u221e, the number of these terms diverges. So it\nis not obvious whether as t\u2192 \u221ea solution exists where A0(t) =\u03b8,At(t) =O(1),\nand all other Ai(t)\u2019s are small, which would imply that the Gaussian describing the\nunmutated population contains a nonzero fraction of the total po pulation. We will\n\ufb01nd that such a solution can exist only when N >2.\nFirst we \ufb01nd the steady-state solutions in the long-time limit t\u2192 \u221e. In steady\nstate, the time arguments on the Aiand on \u0393 can be dropped, and the recursion\nrelations become:\nA0=\u03b8 (30)\nA1=\u03b8Qv , (31)\nAi=v/bracketleftbiggi\u22121\ni/bracketrightbiggN/2\nAi\u22121(i>1), (32)\nand\n1\u2212\u03b8\nv=\u03b8Q+ lim\nt\u2192\u221et/summationdisplay\ni=1Ai/parenleftbiggi\ni+1/parenrightbiggN/2\n, (33)\nwhere we have de\ufb01ned v= (1\u2212\u03b8)/\u0393. We explicitly allow for the possibility that the\namplitudeA\u221e\u2261limt\u2192\u221eAt(t) is nonzero.\nThe solution to Eqs. (30-33) is:\nA0=\u03b8,\nAi=\u03b8Qi\u2212N/2vi, i\u22651, (34)\n8\nwherevmust satisfy:\n1\u2212\u03b8\nv=A\u221e+\u03b8Q\u221e/summationdisplay\ni=0vi/parenleftbigg1\ni+1/parenrightbiggN/2\n. (35)\nNote thatv\u22641, for otherwise the Aicannot sum to unity, which is required for\nnormalization of the probability.8Since asvincreases the left hand side of Eq. (35)\nmonotonically decreases and the right hand side monotonically increa ses, a solution\nwithA\u221e= 0 can exist only if \u03b8Q/summationtext\u221e\ni=0/parenleftBig\n1\ni+1/parenrightBigN/2>1\u2212\u03b8. Conversely, if this inequality\nis not satis\ufb01ed, then we expect A\u221e>0. SinceA\u221e\u223climt\u2192\u221evt, we require v= 1\nifA\u221eis nonzero. We show below that such a solution is the long-time limit of th e\nsolution of the time-dependent equations.\nFirst consider the case when A\u221e\u221dnegationslash= 0. Since the sum in Eq. (35) converges if\nN >2, and diverges otherwise, we see that A\u221e\u221dnegationslash= 0 can occur only if N >2. When\nthe sum does converge, the unmutated \ufb01tness peak, whose amplit ude isA\u221eand\nwhose width is given by Eq. (15), can contain a nonzero fraction of t he total weight.\nEvaluating Eq. (33) with v= 1, we \ufb01nd A\u221e= 1\u2212\u03b8\u2212\u03b8Q\u03b6(N/2), where\u03b6(N/2) is\nthe Riemann zeta function(Carrier et al., 1983; Abramowitz & Stegun, 1972).\nNow we consider the possibility of a solution in which the unmutated pop ulation\nconstitutes an in\ufb01nitesimal fraction of the total population as t\u2192 \u221e. SinceA\u221e= 0,\nwe must have:1\u2212\u03b8\n\u03b8Q= \u03a6(N/2,v), (36)\nwherev<1 and \u03a6(a,x) is the polylogarithm function(Lewin, 1981):\n\u03a6(a,x)\u2261\u221e/summationdisplay\ni=11\niaxi. (37)\nWhena >1, \u03a6(a,x= 1) =\u03b6(a) is \ufb01nite, where again \u03b6(z) is the Riemann zeta\nfunction. Therefore, for N >2, the the right hand side of Eq. (36) is bounded as\nv\u21921, and a solution exists only if (1 \u2212\u03b8)/(\u03b8Q)<\u03b6(N/2). In theQ\u226a1 limit that\nwe have assumed, this happens only when 1 \u2212\u03b8is very small also. If this condition\nis not satis\ufb01ed, then a nonzero fraction of the population must be in the unmutated\nstate.\nWhenN= 2, \u03a6(1,v) =\u2212log(1\u2212v), and in the limit \u03b8Q/(1\u2212\u03b8)\u226a1, one \ufb01nds\nv\u22481\u2212exp/bracketleftBigg\n\u22121\u2212\u03b8\n\u03b8Q/bracketrightBigg\n, (38)\n8This inequality is derived in (Waxman & Peck, 1998), and is closely relate d to results derived\nby B\u00a8 urger and collaborators (B\u00a8 urger, 1986), (B\u00a8 urger, 1988 ), (B\u00a8 urger & Hofbauer, 1994), (B\u00a8 urger\n& Bomze, 1996)\n9\nso that:\n\u0393\u2248(1\u2212\u03b8)/parenleftBigg\n1+exp/bracketleftBigg\n\u22121\u2212\u03b8\n\u03b8Q/bracketrightBigg/parenrightBigg\n(N= 2). (39)\nWhenN= 1, the leading order term as v\u21921 can be calculated by noting that, for\nallv <1, \u03a6(1\n2,v) obeys the bounds:9\n/integraldisplay\u221e\n1dx1\u221axvx<\u03a6(1\n2,v)</integraldisplay\u221e\n0dx1\u221axvx. (40)\nThe integrals both converge at their lower limits. They also converge at their upper\nlimits when v <1, but not when v= 1. The behavior near the upper limit can be\nused to estimate that, as vapproaches 1,\n\u03a6(1\n2,v)\u223c/integraldisplay\u221e\n0dx1\u221axexp[\u2212x|lnv|]\n=/radicalBigg\u03c0\n|lnv|/integraldisplay\u221e\n0dtexp[\u2212t2]\n=\u03c0\n2/radicalBig\n|lnv|\n\u2248\u03c0/(2\u221a\n1\u2212v). (41)\nThus,v\u22481\u2212[(\u03c0\u03b8Q)/(2(1\u2212\u03b8))]2, and:\n\u0393\u2248(1\u2212\u03b8)\uf8eb\n\uf8ed1+/parenleftBigg\u03c0\u03b8Q\n2(1\u2212\u03b8)/parenrightBigg2\uf8f6\n\uf8f8(N= 1). (42)\nNow we calculate the function \u03c6(/vector x,t\u2192 \u221e).10First we consider the case when \u03c6\nhas a\u03b4-function piece.\nIn this regime, as t\u2192 \u221e,A0=\u03b8,Ai=\u03b8Q(1/i)N/2(i\u22651), andA\u221e, the weight\nin the\u03b4\u2212function, is A\u221e= 1\u2212\u03b8\u2212\u03b8Q\u03b6(N/2), where\u03b6(N/2) is the Riemann zeta\n9These bounds follow because the integrand is monotonically decreas ing. For any positive integer\njandv\u22641, one has/integraltextj+1\njdx1\u221axvx<1\u221ajvj</integraltextj\nj\u22121dx1\u221axvx.\n10The form of the distribution calculated by Waxman and Peck (their fo otnote 29) does not apply\nhere because they require simultaneous validity of the inequalities \u03b8Vs/m2\u226a1,m2/Vs\u226a1, and\nN\u226aVs/m2. Our calculation applies whenever Vs/m2\u226a1.\n10\nfunction. Therefore,\n\u03c6(/vector x,t\u2192 \u221e) = (1\u2212\u03b8\u2212\u03b8Q\u03b6(N/2))\u03b4(x)+\u03b8(2\u03c0m2)\u2212N/2exp/bracketleftBigg\n\u2212x2\n2m2/bracketrightBigg\n+\u03b8Q\u221e/summationdisplay\nn=1(1/n)N/2(2\u03c0Vs/n)\u2212N/2exp/bracketleftBigg\n\u2212nx2\n2Vs/bracketrightBigg\n= (1\u2212\u03b8\u2212\u03b8Q\u03b6(N/2))\u03b4(x)+\u03b8(2\u03c0m2)\u2212N/2exp/bracketleftBigg\n\u2212x2\n2m2/bracketrightBigg\n+\u03b8Q(2\u03c0Vs)\u2212N/2/parenleftBigg\nexp/bracketleftBiggx2\n2Vs/bracketrightBigg\n\u22121/parenrightBigg\u22121\n. (43)\nThus we see that when \u03c6(/vector x,t\u2192 \u221e) has a\u03b4-function piece, there is in addition a\ndivergent contribution at small x, proportional to 1 /x2. When the distribution is\nsmooth, we have A0=\u03b8andAi=\u03b8Q(1/i)N/2vi(i\u22651), andv <1, and we obtain:\n\u03c6(/vector x,t\u2192 \u221e) =\u03b8(2\u03c0m2)\u2212N/2exp/bracketleftBigg\n\u2212x2\n2m2/bracketrightBigg\n+\u03b8Q(2\u03c0Vs)\u2212N/2/parenleftBigg\nv\u22121exp/bracketleftBiggx2\n2Vs/bracketrightBigg\n\u22121/parenrightBigg\u22121\n. (44)\nThe sums that arise here are identical to those that come up in the c alculation of\nBose-Einstein condensation for an ideal Bose gas(de Groot et al., 1950). The weight\nin the\u03b4\u2212function in the genotype distribution, A\u221e, is analogous to the condensate\nfraction in the Bose condensation problem. The parameter N, which here describes\nthe number of traits a\ufb00ected by a mutation, is the number of spatia l dimensions in\nthe Bose gas calculation. That the super\ufb02uid fraction must be zero for a Bose gas\nin one and two dimensions is a special case of a general result in the th eory of phase\ntransitions(Mermin & Wagner, 1966), (Hohenberg, 1967), (Fr\u00a8 o lich & P\ufb01ster, 1981).\nWe now discuss the time evolution of the population distribution. We be gin with\nsome qualitative remarks. When v <1, the sum in the solution Eq. (35) converges\ngeometrically. Therefore, in this regime one expects the approach to thet\u2192 \u221e\nlimit to be exponential. In the regime where a \u03b4\u2212function contribution is present as\nt\u2192 \u221e, the\u03b4\u2212function is the long-time limit of a Gaussian describing the unmutated\npopulation. The squared width of this Gaussian narrows as 1 /t, so we expect the\napproach to the long-time limit to be power-law. These expectations are supported\nby the explicit calculation that we now present. We, in fact, show tha t the long-time\ncorrections to the amplitude of the \u03b4\u2212function are also proportional to 1 /t.\nWe again write recursion relations describing the transitions betwee n the various\nGaussians, now allowing for explicit time dependence in the Ai(t). De\ufb01ning v(t) =\n11\n(1\u2212\u03b8)/\u0393(t+1), these recursion relations are, for t>0:\nA0(t) =\u03b8 , (45)\nA1(t) =Qv(t\u22121)A0(t\u22121), (46)\nAi(t) =v(t\u22121)/parenleftbiggi\u22121\ni/parenrightbiggN/2\nAi\u22121(t\u22121), (47)\n1\u2212\u03b8\nv(t)=QA0(t)+t/summationdisplay\ni=1Ai(t)/parenleftbiggi\ni+1/parenrightbiggN/2\n. (48)\nFor the initial conditions A0(t= 0) = 1 and Ai>0(t= 0) = 0, these recursion relations\nhave the solution:\nAi(t) =Qt\u22121/productdisplay\nt\u2032=t\u2212iv(t\u2032)/parenleftbigg1\ni/parenrightbiggN/2\nA0(t\u2212i+1). (49)\nThe self-consistency condition is:\n1\u2212\u03b8\nv(t)=Q\nv(t)\uf8ee\n\uf8f0t+1/summationdisplay\nj=1/parenleftBigg1\nj/parenrightBiggN/2\nA0(t\u2212j)t/productdisplay\nt\u2032=t\u2212j+1v(t\u2032)\uf8f9\n\uf8fb. (50)\nNow we separate out explicitly the term j=t+1; this is reasonable because v(t\u2032= 0)\nis larger than all the other v\u2019s by a factor proportional to 1 /Q, yielding:\n1\u2212\u03b8\nv(t)=Q\u03b8\nv(t)t/summationdisplay\nj=1/parenleftBigg1\nj/parenrightBiggN/2t/productdisplay\nt\u2032=t\u2212j+1v(t\u2032)+(1\u2212\u03b8)/parenleftbigg1\nt+1/parenrightbiggN/2t\u22121/productdisplay\nt\u2032=1v(t\u2032).(51)\nComparison of this result to that of the steady-state analysis (Eq . (34)) reveals that\nast\u2192 \u221ethe last term on the rhs is just A\u221e, the amplitude of the \u03b4\u2212function.\nFinally, de\ufb01ning \u03b3(t) =/producttextt\nt\u2032=1v(t\u2032), we \ufb01nd\n(1\u2212\u03b8) =Qt/summationdisplay\nj=1/parenleftBigg1\nj/parenrightBiggN/2\u03b3(t)\n\u03b3(t\u2212j)+(1\u2212\u03b8)/parenleftbigg1\nt+1/parenrightbiggN/2\n\u03b3(t). (52)\nRecall that at long times v(t) approaches a limit v\u22641. Therefore, for large t,\n\u03b3(t) =C\u03b3vt, whereC\u03b3is a constant, up to corrections that vanish as t\u2192 \u221e, and\n(1\u2212\u03b8) =Qt/summationdisplay\nj=1/parenleftBigg1\nj/parenrightBiggN/2\nvj+(1\u2212\u03b8)/parenleftbigg1\nt+1/parenrightbiggN/2\nC\u03b3vt. (53)\nWhenvis strictly less than unity, the convergence is exponential, as expec ted from\nthe qualitative argument given above and in agreement with the resu lt from the\n12\ncontinuous-time equations below. When lim t\u2192\u221ev(t) = 1, then, since the second\nterm on the right hand side is nonzero as t\u2192 \u221e, we must have \u03b3(t) =/producttextt\ni=1v(t) =\nC\u03b4(t+1)N/2, whereC\u03b4is a constant. This implies v(t)\u2192((t+1)/t)N/2\u223c1+O(1/t).\nBy calculating the correction to the sum because of this variation in v(t), we \ufb01nd that\nthe amplitude of the \u03b4\u2212function obeys At(t)\u2212A\u221e\u221dt\u22121ast\u2192 \u221e. WhenN= 2,\nv(t\u2192 \u221e) is exponentially close to unity, so that the decay of the amplitude in t he\nunmutated peak up to extremely long times is governed by the logarit hmic divergence\nof the sum for v= 1. Thus, in this case we expect At(t) to decay logarithmically with\nt.\nIn \ufb01gure 2 we plot At(t), the fractionof the populationwhich is unmutated, versus\ntimetfor the parameter values \u03b8= 0.2 andQ= 0.1, forN= 1, 2, and 3. The curves\nwere obtained by numerical iteration of the recursion relations Eqs . (45\u201348), starting\nwith the initial condition A0(t= 0) = 1 and Ai(t= 0) = 0 for i\u221dnegationslash= 0. We \ufb01nd, as\nexpected, that At(t) decays to zero for N= 1 andN= 2 but not for N= 3. The\nscales on the plot were chosen to emphasize the logarithmic decay wh enN= 2.\nTocompute theprobabilityfunction \u03c6(/vector x,t)we\ufb01rst calculatetheamplitudes Ai(t),\nusing the recursion relation, and then sum the corresponding Gaus sians (see Eqs. (19)\nand (10)) to obtain numerical values of the probability. These resu lts are plotted in\n\ufb01gures 3, 4, and 5 for the parameter-values \u03b8= 0.2 andQ= 0.1. ForN= 1, see\n\ufb01gure 3, we plot \u03c6(/vector x,t) against the magnitude of xfor various values of the time,\nt. The picture shows a probability distribution which \ufb01rst gets narrow er, but then\nsettles down to a time-independent behavior for the largest times. Also drawn on this\nplot is the in\ufb01nite-time probability, derived from Eqs. (34) and (35). The probability\n\u03c6(/vector x,t) settles down to this limiting behavior most slowly near /vector x= 0, where \ufb01tnesses\nchange slowly with /vector x.\nForN= 3, a corresponding calculation shows a probability function which ge ts\nmore and more peaked as time goes on, see \ufb01gure 4. Notice how, for t= 1000,\nthe peak sticks up sharply from a more slowly varying background. T o see how this\npeaking occurs, we plot in \ufb01gure 5 a scaled version of \ufb01gure 4. In this version, we plot\n\u03c6s(/vector xs,t) where\u03c6s(/vector x,t) is the result of dividing \u03c6(/vector x,t) by the predicted growth of the\npeak, proportional to tN/2, giving us a scaled y-variable \u03c6s(/vector x,t) =\u03c6(/vector x,t)t\u2212N/2. The\nscaledx-variable is /vector xs=/vector xt1/2. The resulting plot becomes time-independent for large\ntimes and not-too-large values of /vector xs. In this way, we see how the peak continually\ngets narrower, and more and more dominates the small- xbehavior.\nNow we turn to the question of the role of initial conditions in the beha vior of\ndiscrete-time model. This question is important because the method of solution of\nthe discrete-time model outlined in this section assumes that the init ial distribution\n\u03c6(/vector x,t= 0) is Gaussian. Here we present our arguments why the results of the\n13\ncalculation should not depend sensitively on this choice of initial condit ion.\nFirst, notethat any initial distribution \u03c6(/vector x,t= 0)which has a width much greater\nthan bothVsandm2will narrow to two Gaussians of widths Vsandm2after one\nmutation step. Therefore, the behavior of any broad distribution will be indistin-\nguishable from that of a Gaussian of width \u223c>m2.\nNow we consider more general variation of the initial conditions by ex amining the\ntime-dependent Eq. (51). Every term in the sum arises from a muta tion event at\nsome time t\u22650; changing the initial conditions changes only the last term on the\nright hand side. In the t\u2192 \u221elimit, the the amplitude of the \u03b4\u2212function is obtained\nby subtracting from unity the fraction of the population which has m utated at some\ntime. The long-time limit, v, does not depend on the initial condition; to see this,\nnotethat either v= 1, inwhich case A\u221eisobtainedby thesubtractionjust described,\nor elsev<1, in which case A\u221e= 0 and the amplitudes of all the terms that depend\non the initial conditions vanish exponentially. Therefore, the initial c onditions do not\na\ufb00ect either the presence or absence of the \u03b4\u2212function or its steady-state amplitude\nwhen it is present.\n4 Continuous-Time Equations\nIn this section we consider the continuous-time evolution described by Eq. (9). In\n(B\u00a8 urger & Bomze, 1996) it is shown that there is a unique time-indep endent solution\nast\u2192 \u221eand the possible solutions are classi\ufb01ed using general properties of linear\noperators(Reed & Simon, 1972). Our results for the long-time limit a re consistent\nwiththeirs. Inaddition, ourapproachenablesustointerpretsimply theemergence(or\nnot) of the \u03b4\u2212function peak as well to address the time-dependence of the appr oach\nto thet\u2192 \u221elimit.\nWe proceed by Fourier transforming Eq. (9). We de\ufb01ne the quantit yn(/vectork,t) =/integraltextdNx \u03c6(/vector x,t)exp[i/vectork\u00b7/vector x] and obtain:\n\u2202n(/vectork,t)\n\u2202t=/bracketleftbigg\na(t)+1\n2V\u22072\n/vectork/bracketrightbigg\nn(/vectork,t)\u2212\u0398[1\u2212f(/vectork)]n(/vectork,t), (54)\nwheref(/vectork) is the Fourier transform of Eq. (5):\nf(/vectork) = exp[\u2212m2k2/2]. (55)\nWe must also specify, in addition to the initial conditions, two boundar y con-\nditions. One boundary condition is determined by the normalization re quirement/integraltextdNx \u03c6(/vector x,t) = 1, which yields:\nn(/vectork= 0,t) = 1. (56)\n14\nThesecond boundaryconditionisthat n(/vectork,t)\u22641forall/vectork, whichinparticularimplies\nthat it cannot diverge as /vectork\u2192 \u221e. This follows from combining the normalization\ncondition with the non-negativity requirement \u03c6(/vector x,t)\u22650:\nn(/vectork,t) =/integraldisplay\ndNx ei/vectork\u00b7/vector x\u03c6(/vector x,t)\u2264/integraldisplay\ndNx \u03c6(/vector x,t) = 1. (57)\nWe now solve this equation in the limit of long times. Since as t\u2192 \u221ebothnand\nabecome independent of time, we must solve:\n/braceleftbigg\n\u22121\n2\u22072\n/vectork\u2212(\u0398V)f(/vectork)/bracerightbigg\n\u03c8(/vectork) =E\u03c8(/vectork), (58)\nwhere\u03c8(/vectork)\u2261limt\u2192\u221en(/vectork,t) and the eigenvalue E=V(limt\u2192\u221ea(t)\u2212\u0398). Eq. (58)\nis just the time-independent Schr\u00a8 odinger equation(Schi\ufb00, 1968) . The parameter N,\nthe number of characters a\ufb00ected by each mutation, here is inter preted as the spatial\ndimensionality. As shown in (B\u00a8 urger & Bomze, 1996, and reference s therein) and\nas discussed here in the Appendix, the long-time solution to the popu lation biology\nmodel is given by the lowest energy eigenstate of this Schr\u00a8 odinger equation.\nThe kinetic energy term \u22121\n2\u22072\n/vectorkin Eq. (58) comes from the \ufb01tness selection. This\nterm, which in /vector x-space causes the distribution to become narrower and narrower ,\nacts to cause it to become wider and wider in /vectork-space. The potential energy term\n\u2212\u0398Vf(/vectork) comes from the mutations. This potential is constant at large k, and has\nan attractive piece at small k. If we assume that the potential has a characteristic\nscale ink, so thatf(/vectork) =F(m/vectork) (clearly the \ufb01tness function considered here is of this\nform), thenwecande\ufb01ne /vector z=m/vectorkandwritetheSchr\u00a8 odinger equationindimensionless\nform: /braceleftbigg\n\u22121\n2\u22072\n/vector z\u2212/parenleftbigg\u0398V\nm2/parenrightbigg\nF(/vector z)/bracerightbigg\n\u03c8(/vector z) =\u02dcE\u03c8(/vector z), (59)\nwhere\u02dcE=E/m2. This equation makes it clear that the nature of the behavior\ndepends only on the single parameter (\u0398 V/m2).\nIf only the selection (kinetic energy) term were present, the solut ions to Eq. (58)\nconsistent with the normalization condition \u03c6(/vectork) = 1 are\n\u03c8(/vector z) = exp[i/vector p\u00b7/vector z], (60)\nwhere/vector p= \u02c6z\u221a\n2\u02dcE, and \u02c6zis a unit vector along /vector z. To be consistent with the boundary\nconditions, we require \u02dcE\u22650. The ground state eigenstate thus has \u02dcE= 0, so that\n\u03c8(/vector z) = 1. Fourier transforming this result, we see that in the absence o f mutations, at\nt=\u221ethe entire population has the same genotype. This result is consiste nt with our\ncalculation in the previous section demonstrating that in the absenc e of mutations\nthe variance of \u03c6(/vector x,t) narrows in proportion to 1 /time.\n15\nSo now we consider the e\ufb00ects of adding the potential arising from t he mutation\nterm. This potential is attractive, so that the question we must ad dress is whether\nthe ground state eigenstate remains extended ( \u03c8(/vector z)\u2192constant as |/vectork| \u2192 \u221e) or\nwhether it results in a bound state with \u02dcE <0, which has \u03c8(/vector z)\u21920 exponentially\ninkas/vectork\u2192 \u221e. In the latter case, the real-space distribution \u03c6(/vector x) is smooth as\n/vector x\u21920. Therefore, if there is a bound state, then only an in\ufb01nitesimal fr action of the\npopulation is unmutated, whereas if there are no bound states, th en a \ufb01nite fraction\nof the population has a unique genotype.\nIt has been proven for the Schr\u00a8 odinger equation that any attra ctive potential, no\nmatter how small, will lead to a bound state for N\u22642(Simon, 1976). Thus, the\npopulation distribution in real space \u03c6(/vector x,t\u2192 \u221e) must be smooth for N\u22642. When\nN >2boundstatesonlyappearifthepotentialislargeenough(\u0398 Vs/m2>CN,where\nCNis of order unity)(Schi\ufb00, 1968). Therefore, in this case, if the pot ential is small\n(weakmutatione\ufb00ects), thenthegroundstateremainsextende d:\u03c8(/vectork)\u2192constant as\n/vectork\u2192 \u221e, and the real space distribution \u03c6(/vector x) has a\u03b4\u2212function piece. If the potential\nis large (strong mutation e\ufb00ects), then there is a bound state, an d the distribution\n\u03c6(/vector x) is not singular at small /vector x.\nIf all the states are extended, then as |/vectork| \u2192 \u221ethe lowest energy state obeys\n\u22072\n/vectorkn(/vectork) = 0 and has the form n(/vectork)\u2192A+Bk\u2212(N\u22122), whereAandBare coe\ufb03cients\ndetermined by matching to the solution in the small |/vectork|region.11\nFor almost all potentials both AandBare nonzero; Fourier transforming the\nterm proportional to Byields:\nB term\u221d/integraldisplay\nd\u2126/integraldisplay\u221e\n0dk kN\u22121eikxcos(\u03b8)k\u2212(N\u22122)\u221dx\u22122. (61)\n(Here,/integraltextd\u2126 is the integral over angles.) Thus, just as in our discrete-time solu tion,\nwe \ufb01nd associated with a \u03b4-function at /vector x= 0 a power-law divergence at small x,\n\u03c6(/vector x)\u221dx\u22122.\nInthe regimewhere the groundstateisbound, there isa \ufb01niteener gy gapbetween\nthe ground state and the excited states, which implies that the the long-time limit is\napproachedexponentially intime. Whenthereisnoboundstate, the energyspectrum\nof the Schr\u00a8 odinger equation is continuous, which leads to power-la w convergence to\nthe long-time limit. These points are discussed in greater detail in the Appendix.\n11This form can be veri\ufb01ed for all Nby several means, the most straightforward being direct\nevaluation using Cartesian coordinates. A more elegant method is to note that we are looking for a\nfunction gwhichsatis\ufb01es0 = \u22072g= div\u00b7gradg. Since grad gis a current /vectorjthat is angle-independent\nand obeys div /vectorj= 0, then/integraltext\nj dSr= 0, where Sis the surface of a sphere of radius r. Therefore, one\nmust have j\u221dr\u2212(N\u22121), so that g\u221dr\u2212(N\u22122).\n16\n5 Relation between the continuous-time and the\ndiscrete-time models\nIn this section we discuss the similarities and di\ufb00erences between the results of our\ndiscrete-time analysis valid when Vs/m2\u226a1 and those of the continuous-time anal-\nysis. The basis of our discussion is Eq. (8), which can be used to desc ribe both\ncases.\nQualitatively, the discrete and continuous models exhibit very similar b ehavior.\nThey both lead to only smooth distributions (a \u201cnormal\u201d phase) for N\u22642, and\nforN >2 display a transition as the mutation rate is decreased between the normal\nphase and a \u201ccondensed\u201d phase, where a \ufb01nite fraction of the pop ulation has a unique\ngenotype. In both models, the convergence to the long-time limit is p ower law in\nthe condensed phase and is exponential in the normal phase. Howe ver, there are\nquantitative di\ufb00erences between the two models, particularly the d etailed dependence\non model parameters.\nInthecontinuous-timemodel, theformofEq.(59)makesitclearth atthebehavior\ndepends only on the single parameter \u0398 V/m2. In contrast, the discrete model that\nwe solve in the limit m2/Vs\u226b1 (Eqs. (24-26)) depends on two parameters: Q=\n(1 +m2/Vs)\u2212N/2and\u03b8. ForN >2, the discrete model might or might not have\na condensate, depending on the value of the ratio \u03b8Q/(1\u2212\u03b8). In this regime, the\ncontinuous-time model is always in the condensed phase.\nWe use Eq. (8) to discuss the relation between the continuous- and discrete-time\nmodels. One can Fourier transform this equation (as we did in section 4 for the\ncontinuous-time model) and interpret the result as a quantum-mec hanical problem\nof a particle in a potential which is applied only at the discrete times t=n\u03c4as in\nEq. (8).12\nThe discrete model has two parameters while the continuous model has only one,\nsince Eq. (8) depends not just on the mean mutation rate \u0398 but also on\u03c4, the time\nbetween mutation events. Thus, in principle the discrete-time mode l has one more\nparameter than the continuous-time one. If \u03c4is increased by a factor of two, then the\nproduct\u03b8V(\u03b8the mutation probability per generation and Vthe viability selection\nparameter) remains constant, but Vitself is halved. The analysis in section 3, which\nis valid when V/m2is very small, and hence in the limit when \u03c4is very long, yields\na solution in which that both \u03b8andV/m2enter explicitly and not just as a product.\nNonetheless, two models have very similar outcomes.\n12We take the limit where a very strong potential is applied for a very sh ort time at each tn=n\u03c4.\n17\n6 Comparison with sequence database statistics\nHere we present our investigations of the statistical properties o f DNA sequences\narchived in genetic databases. The aim is to see if observed sequenc e variability of\na gene is correlated with its degree of pleiotropy. The focus in this se ction is on a\nqualitative prediction of the model, that genes with a high degree of p leiotropy should\nhaveanarrowerdistributionofallelesthanthosethata\ufb00ectonlyon etrait. Thistrend,\nwhich is consistent with the mathematical results of the previous se ctions, is easy to\nunderstand: if a gene of high \ufb01tness is pleiotropic, then because ea ch mutation a\ufb00ects\nseveral characters independently, the chances are high that a g iven mutation leads to\na large \ufb01tness decrease.\nOur \ufb01rst test for possible correlation between degree of pleiotrop y and the proba-\nbility distribution describing genetic variation is simply to count the num ber of natu-\nrally occurring variants of various genes in the Drosophila database FlyBase(FlyBase,\n1998). We choose to include naturally occurring alleles, including spon taneous muta-\ntions arising in laboratory stocks, of the genes analyzed. Mutagen -induced variants\nare not included, since there is no evidence that they exist in natura l populations.\nTable 1 shows data for nine genes: brown,cinnabar ,ecdysone receptor ,engrailed ,\nfork head ,hairless,notch,vestigial , andwhite. The number of naturally occur-\nring variants is tabulated together with the length of the primary tr anscript and the\napproximate length of the genomic region encompassing the gene an d its \ufb02anking reg-\nulatory regions. Transcript and genomic lengths are taken from th e full-format gene\nreports in FlyBase. For genes with multiple transcripts, we report t he length of the\nlongest described transcript. When the full gene report does not include the genomic\nlength, this is estimated from the FlyBase molecular map of the gene. The number\nof variants per gene is normalized both by the transcript length and by the genomic\nlength. In both cases, the values range over approximately three orders of magnitude.\nWe estimate the degree of pleiotropy of each of the listed genes acc ording to the num-\nber of tissues/structures and developmental stages in which the genes are expressed.\nThis ordering is admittedly arbitrary to some extent, but few would a rgue with the\nconclusion that fork head (encoding a transcription factor essential for development\nof the midgut) and engrailed (encoding a homeotic gene establishing segmentation)\nare more pleiotropic than the eye color mutants cinnabar ,white, andbrown. Inspec-\ntion of Table 1 reveals a clear inverse correlation between estimated pleiotropy and\nnumber of variants/transcribed length or variants/genomic lengt h. This relationship\nis consistent with the prediction of Waxman and Peck\u2019s model.\nA weak point of this approach is that other factors besides degree of pleiotropy\ncould lead to the observed di\ufb00erences in the number of variants. Fo r instance, even\n18\ntwo genes which only a\ufb00ect single traits could have vastly di\ufb00erent va riabilities, if\nthe traits have greatly di\ufb00erent e\ufb00ects on overall \ufb01tness. For ex ample, a gene that\ncontrols eye color may well have a much smaller overall e\ufb00ect on \ufb01tne ss than a gene\nthat controls a crucial developmental function. In the population genetics model,\ndi\ufb00erences of this type are re\ufb02ected by di\ufb00erent values of the \ufb01tn ess parameter Vs.\nWithin the model, di\ufb00erences in overall variability caused by changing Vscan be\ndistinguished from those caused by changing the degree of pleiotro pyNbecause they\nyield very di\ufb00erent functional forms for the distribution function \u03c6(/vector x). However,\ncountingmutationsyieldsnoinformationaboutthefunctionalform ofthedistribution\nfunction and thus cannot be used to distinguish between the mecha nisms.\nOur second strategy for relating degree of pleiotropy to statistic s of archived DNA\nsequences aims to obtain information about the form of the probab ility distribution\nfor various genes. It assumes that two genetic variants whose se quences are highly\nsimilar in sequence space code for genes that are close together in \ufb01 tness space. We\nuse the BLAST 2 sequence similarity search tool(Altschul et al., 1997) to search\nthe GENBANK and EMBL DNA sequence databases13against the 8 gene sequences\nlisted in Table 2. These databases contain sequences of genes from many organisms,\nthough a preponderance of the sequences are from humans. Give n a target sequence,\nBLAST 2 generates a list of matching sequences along with scores wh ich measure\nthe degree of similarity. Because the maximum possible score for a giv en sequence is\nlarger for longer sequences, we avoided examining genes that were either very short or\nvery long. As can be seen in table 2, the lengths of the sequences ex amined varied by\nless than a factor of ten. Only genes were used whose list of matche s was truncated\nbecause the score fell below the cuto\ufb00 value of 40; no genes were u sed whose match\nlist was truncated because the number of matching sequence exce eded BLAST 2\u2019s\nmaximum number of matches of 500. As shown in table 2, the number o f matches\nobtained also varies by roughly an order of magnitude for the genes in the table, and\nis not obviously correlated with the length of the gene.\nHigh BLAST 2 scores correspond to sequences which match the sea rch sequence\nthe most closely. The scores range from roughly 104(a sequence matching itself) to\nthe default cuto\ufb00 of 40. We assume that this score is inversely corr elated with the\nevolutionary distance between the input gene and the retrieved se quences, so that\na gene with a high fraction of matches with low scores has a broader p robability\ndistribution \u03c6(x) than a gene with more matches with high scores. Thus, if all the\nmatches tend to be very good, the gene is considered to be less var iable than one\nwith many poor matches. We examine the statistics of the closeness of the matches,\n13These databases and the BLAST 2 search tool are maintained by th e National Center for\nBiotechnology Information (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).\n19\nin particular the fractions of the total number of matches that fa ll into given ranges\nof scores.\nFigure6isaplotofahistogramofthefractionofthematchesinagive nscorerange\nobtained versus the inverse of the score for several genes. We d o observe signi\ufb01cant\nvariability between these genes; for example, cytochrome P-1-450 , which codes for a\ngeneral-purpose antioxidant expressed in many tissues and is thus plausibly highly\npleiotropic, has relatively many very good matches compared to rhodopsin , which\nis quite speci\ufb01c, coding for a protein essential for vision. However, we cannot claim\nthat there is an unambiguous correlation between degree of pleiotr opy and these\nplots. For example, HOX A1 has many poor matches, where it might be expected to\nbe pleiotropic, since it is essential to many developmental functions . Thus, though\ninteresting variations in the statistics of DNA sequences for di\ufb00ere nt genes are found,\nwe have not been able to demonstrate convincingly a correlation bet ween degree of\npleiotropy and these statistical variations.\nThe behavior of HOX A1 can be explained by a process of repeated duplication\nanddivergenceover thecourseofevolution. Manyoftheretrieve dgeneshaveassumed\ndistinct but related developmental functions. The BLAST 2 analysis presented here\ndoes not account for a shift in score distributions arising from diver gence among\nmembers of gene families and superfamilies. Another fundamental d i\ufb03culty with our\nanalysis is illustrated by the case of alpha-tubulin , which codes for a protein vital to\nthe formation of microtubules. On the one hand, microtubules are e xpressed in many\ndi\ufb00erent tissues, but on the other hand, all its functions arise fro m similar structural\nproperties. Thus, one could categorize alpha-tubulin as either highly pleiotropic (since\nit is expressed in many tissues) or as non-pleiotropic (since the func tion is similar\neverywhere where it is expressed). In short, though degree of p leiotropy is de\ufb01ned in\nthe populations genetic model, it is not clear how to quantify it in terms of biological\nfunction.\nThere are several additional di\ufb03culties and ambiguities inherent in co mparisons\nbetween genome sequence data and population genetics models of t he type consid-\nered here. First, the database scores are based on the quality of sequence alignments,\nwhereas the population genetics models de\ufb01ne distances in terms of \ufb01tness, which is\na phenotypic quantity. Fitness distance and evolutionary sequenc e distance may be\nquite di\ufb00erent; for example, point mutations at di\ufb00erent locations m ay range in e\ufb00ect\nfrom unobservable to lethal. However, even if there is not a single de \ufb01nite relation-\nship between sequence distance and \ufb01tness distance, so long as th ese quantities are\npositively correlated with each other, meaningful results may be ob tained. Variabil-\nity in the relation between the distances will result in noisy data, but d i\ufb00erent genes\nare all subject to similar uncertainties. Therefore, it is plausible to h ope that, if sig-\n20\nni\ufb01cant di\ufb00erences between the sequence variability of two genes a re observed, they\nre\ufb02ect di\ufb00erences in the \ufb01tness distribution \u03c6(/vector x) of the population genetics models.\nAnother limitation of our analysis is that we consider the \ufb01tnesses of alleles as \ufb01xed.\nThis is not necessarily the case, as many gene products function as components of\nmulti-protein structures or pathways(Lewontin, 1974), (Dover & Flavell, 1984). This\ndependency of the \ufb01tness value of a speci\ufb01c sequence variant on t he remainder of\nthe genotype is manifested explicitly by the existence of epistatic int eractions (e.g.,\n(Fijneman et al., 1996), (van Wezel et al., 1996)).\nIn addition, one may worry that the population genetics model we ha ve used\ninvolves a continuously varying phenotype, whereas sequence var iations are discrete.\nHowever, because genes are thousands of base pairs long, there is still a huge range\nof variability, and the use of a continuum model is therefore reason able.\nFinally, as mentioned above, pleiotropy itself is de\ufb01ned in terms of phe notypic\n\ufb01tness, and it is not clear how to create an independent measure th at enables one to\nassign objectively the degree of pleiotropy Nto a given gene. This is a serious fun-\ndamental di\ufb03culty that must be overcome if one is to make meaningfu l quantitative\nstatistical analysis of the possible correlations between the seque nce statistics and the\ndegree of pleiotropy.\n7 Discussion\nIn this paper we have analyzed some variants of a population biology m odel incorpo-\nrating selection, mutation, and pleiotropy. We have focussed on un derstanding the\ncircumstances under which at long times a nonzero fraction of the p opulation has a\nunique genotype, and on characterizing the time dependence of th e population distri-\nbution in this regime. We have analyzed both the discrete-time model of (Waxman\n& Peck, 1998) as well as an associated continuous-time model. We \ufb01n d:\n1. In both the discrete and continuous-time models, a unique genot ype can emerge\nonly when N, the number of characters a\ufb00ected by each gene, is greater tha n\ntwo, a result in agreement with (Waxman & Peck, 1998). For any N >2,\nthe in\ufb01nite-time population distribution \u03c6(/vector x,t\u2192 \u221e) contains a \u03b4\u2212function\ncontribution when the mutation rate is nonzero but small, but not wh en the\nmutation rate is large enough.\n2. In the regime where \u03c6(/vector x,t\u2192 \u221e) has a\u03b4-function contribution, this \u03b4-function\nis accompanied by a 1 /x2singularity at small /vector x.\n3. The\u03b4-function peak emerges as the limit of a peak that continually become s\n21\nhigher and narrower. Thus, in this regime the convergence to the t\u2192 \u221elimit\nis power-law.\n4. In the regime when \u03c6(/vector x,t\u2192 \u221e) is smooth, the convergence to this distribution\nis exponential in time.\n5. The continuous- and discrete-time models exhibit qualitatively iden tical behav-\nior, but there are quantitative di\ufb00erences between them.\nOur analysis of the discrete-time equations relies on the use of Gaus sian functions\nfor both the \ufb01tness and mutation terms. However, our analysis of the continuous-\ntime model assumes only that the potential in the quantum mechanic s problem is\nattractive and short-ranged. Therefore, we expect our result s to apply qualitatively\nfor a large class of di\ufb00erent mutation terms.\nOther mechanisms giving rise to genetic diversity such as antagonist ic pleiotropy,\ngenetic drift, and discreteness of alleles change qualitatively the na ture of the equa-\ntions describing the system. It will be interesting to see whether th e \u201ccondensation\u201d\nphenomenon investigated here is robust when these e\ufb00ects are ta ken into account.\nIn addition to our mathematical analysis, we also attempted to asse ss whether\nthe degree of pleiotropy of genes resulted in systematic trends in t he degree of varia-\ntion they exhibited in the mutations documented in online genetic data bases. These\nattempts to correlate the degree of pleiotropy with the statistics of the sequence\nvariations were inconclusive.\nAvailable database resources do not allow unbiased sampling of the se quence vari-\nation present in a natural population. Such a database is likely to eme rge as the\nHuman Genome Project\u2019s present initiative to sample the extent of s equence varia-\ntion in a wide array of genes in the American population progresses.\n8 Acknowledgments\nWearegratefulforsupportbytheNationalScienceFoundation, GrantDMR96-26119\n(SNC), and the O\ufb03ce of Naval Research, Grant N00014-96-1-01 27 (LPK).

(54) is given\nby the lowest energy eigenstate of the associated Schr\u00a8 odinger E q. (58). This result\nhas been shown by B\u00a8 urger and collaborators(B\u00a8 urger & Bomze, 1 996, and references\ntherein); for completeness we derive it here and emphasize the implic ations for the\napproach to the long-time behavior in the population biology model.\nWe assume that we know the solution of the time-independent proble m, which is\na set of eigenstates un(/vector x) which satisfy:\n\u22121\n2\u2207z2un(/vector z)+V(/vector z)un(/vector z) =Enun(/vector z). (62)\nThe eigenstates un(/vector z) are complete (any function can be written as a linear combi-\nnation of them) and can be chosen to be orthonormal:\n/integraldisplay\ndNz u\u2217\nn1(/vector z)un2(/vector z) =\u03b4n1,n2, (63)\nwhere the star denotes complex conjugate. This normalization is us ual in quantum\nmechanics(Schi\ufb00, 1968).\nWe need to examine the time-dependent Eq. (54); using scaled varia bles, it is\nwritten as:\n\u2212\u2202\u03c8(/vector z,t)\n\u2202t=\u2212/bracketleftbigg\na(t)+1\n2\u22072\nz/bracketrightbigg\n\u03c8(/vector z,t)+V(/vector z)\u03c8(/vector z,t), (64)\nwhere\na(t) =/bracketleftbigg\n\u22121\n2\u22072\nz+V(z)/bracketrightbigg\n\u03c8(/vector z,t)|/vector z=0. (65)\nWe write the wave function at time t0,\u03c8(/vector z,t0), as a linear combination of eigenstates:\n\u03c8(/vector z,t0) =/summationdisplay\nibi(t0)ui(z). (66)\nThe condition \u03c8(/vector z= 0,t0) = 1 is enforced by requiring/summationtext\nibi(t0)ui(/vector z= 0) = 1. By\nsubstituting the form (66) for \u03c8and using the orthonormality of the eigenstates, one\n\ufb01nds equations for the time-evolution of the coe\ufb03cients bi:\n\u2212dbi(t)\ndt=bi(t)[Ei\u2212a(t)]. (67)\nIntegrating this equation yields:\nbi(t) =bi(t0)A(t)e\u2212Eit, (68)\n23\nwhereA(t) = exp/bracketleftBig/integraltextt\nt0ds a(s)/bracketrightBig\n. Thus the ratio of the weights of any two eigenstates\ni1andi2is given by:\nbi1(t)\nbi2(t)=bi1(t0)\nbi2(t0)exp[\u2212(Ei1\u2212Ei2)t]. (69)\nAt long times the exponential factor ensures that the state with t he largest weight is\nthe one with the lowest energy.\nIf there is a nonzero energy gap between the lowest and second-lo west energy\neigenstates (no \u03b4-function in \u03c6(/vector x)), then Eq. (69) implies that the approach to the\nlong-time limit is exponential in time. If there is no bound state, then a ll the states\nare extended and the spectrum is continuous; the Eitake the form Ei=q2\ni/2, where\nqihas the dimension of a wavevector in /vector zspace,(Schi\ufb00, 1968) and hence a distance\nin the original /vector xspace. Therefore,\n\u03c8(/vector z,t) =A(t)/summationdisplay\nibi(t0)e\u2212q2\nit/2. (70)\nThe relative weight of the eigenstate iremains large until qi\u223c/radicalBig\n1/t. Thus, the\n\u03b4-function at in\ufb01nite times emerges from a peak that is narrowing, ha ving a width\nproportional to/radicalBig\n1/t.\nReferences\nAbramowitz, M. and Stegun, C. A. (Eds.) (1972).

E-mail: terry@stat.berkeley.edu\n98 T. P. Speed\nThe use of statistics to study linear sequences of biomolecular units can be\ndescriptive or it can be predictive. A very wide range of statistical t echniques has\nbeen used in this context, and while statistical models can be extrem ely useful,\nthe underlying stochastic mechanisms should never be taken literally . A model or\nmethodcanbreakdownatanytimewithoutnotice. Further,biologic alcon\ufb01rmation\nof predictions is almost always necessary.\nThe statistics of biological sequences can be global or it can be local. For\nexample, we might consider the global base composition of genomes: E. colihas\n25% A, 25% C, 25% G, 25% T, while P. falciparum has 82%A+T. At the very\nlocal, the triple ATG is the near universal motif indicating the start of translation\nin DNA coding sequence. A major role of statistics in this context is to characterize\nindividual sequences or classes of biological sequences using proba bility models,\nand to make use of these models to identify them against a backgrou nd of other\nsequences. Needless to say, the models and the tools vary greatly in complexity.\nExtensive use is made in biological sequence analysis of the notions of motif or\ndomain in proteins, and site in DNA. We shall use these terms intercha ngeably to\ndescribe the recurring elements of interest to us. It is important t o note that while\nwe focus on the sequence characteristics of motifs, domains or sit es, in practice they\nalso embody (biochemical) structural signi\ufb01cance.\n2. Deterministic models\nThe C2H2 (cysteine-cysteine histidine-histidine) zinc-\ufb01nger DNA bin ding do-\nmain is composed of 25-30 amino acid residues including two conserved cysteines\nand two conserved histidines spaced in a particular way, with some re strictions on\nthe residues in between and nearby. Of course the arrangement r e\ufb02ects the three-\ndimensional molecular structure into which the amino-acid sequence folds, for it is\nthe structure which has the real biochemical signi\ufb01cance, see Figu re 1, which was\nobtained from http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/ . An example of this motif is the 27-\nFigure 1: A C2H2 zinc \ufb01nger DNA binding domain\nBiological Sequence Analysis 99\nletter sequence known as 1ZNF, this being a Protein Data Bank ident i\ufb01er for the\nstructure XFIN-31 of X. laevis . Its amino acid sequence is\n1ZNF: XYKCGLCERSFVEKSALSRHQRVHKNX\nNote the presence of the two Cs separated by 2 other residues, and the two Hs\nseparated by 3 other residues. Here and elsewhere, X denotes an arbitrary amino\nacid residue. A popular and useful summary description of C2H2 zinc \ufb01ngers which\nclearly includes our example, is the regular expression\nC\u2212X(2,4)\u2212C\u2212X(3)\u2212[LIVMFYWC ]\u2212X(8)\u2212H\u2212X(3,5)\u2212H\nwhereX(m)denotesasequenceof nunspeci\ufb01edaminoacids, while X(m,n)denotes\nfrommtonsuch, and the bracketsenclose mutually exclusive alternatives. Th ere is\na richer set of notation for regular expressions of this kind, but for our purposes it is\nenough to note that this representationis essentiallydeterministic , with uncertainty\nincluded only through mutually exclusive possibilities (e.g. length or res idue) which\nare not otherwise distinguished.\nSimple and e\ufb03cient algorithms exist for searching query sequences o f residues\nto \ufb01nd every instance of the regular expression above. In so doing with sequence\nin which all instances of the motif are known, we may identify some sub -sequences\nof the query sequence which are not C2H2 zinc \ufb01nger DNA binding dom ains, i.e.\nwhich are false positives, and we may miss some sub-sequences which are C2H2\nzinc \ufb01ngers, i.e. which are false negatives. Thus we have essentially d eterministic\ndescriptions and search algorithms for the C2H2 motifs using regula r expressions.\nTheir performance can be described by the frequency of false pos itives and false\nnegatives, equivalently, their complements, the speci\ufb01city and sen sitivity of the\nregular expression. We do not have space for an extensive bibliogra phy, so for more\non regular expressions and on most of the other concepts we intro duce below, see\n[2].\n3. Regular expressions can be limiting\nMost protein binding sites are characterized by some degree of seq uence speci-\n\ufb01city, but seeking a consensus DNA sequence is often an inadequat e way to rec-\nognize their motifs. Simply listing the alternatives seen at a position ma y not be\nvery informative, but keeping track of the frequencies with which t he di\ufb00erent al-\nternatives appear can be very valuable. Thus position-speci\ufb01c nuc leotide or amino\nacid distributions came to represent the variability in DNA or protein m otif com-\nposition. This is just the set of marginal distribution of letters at ea ch position.\nRather than present an extensive tabulation of frequencies for o ur C2H2 zinc \ufb01n-\nger example, we present a pictorial representation: a sequence lo go coming from\nhttp://blocks.fhcrc.org .\nSequencelogosarescaledrepresentationofposition-speci\ufb01cnuc leotideoramino\nacid distributions.

The proportions of each nucleotide or amino acid at a positio n are in re-\nlation to their observed frequency at that position, with the most f requent on top,\nthe next most frequent below, etc.\n4. Pro\ufb01les\nIt is convenient for our present purposes to de\ufb01ne a pro\ufb01le as a se t of position-\nspeci\ufb01c distributions describing a motif. (Traditionally the term has b een used for\nthe derived scores.) How would we use a set of such distributions to s earch a query\nsequence for instances of the motif? The answer from bioinformat ics is that we\nscorethe query sequence, and for suitably large scores, declare that a candidate\nsubsequence is an instance of our motif.\nThere are a number of approaches for deriving pro\ufb01le scores, but the easiest to\nexplain here is this: scores are log-likelihood ratio test statistics , for discriminating\nbetween a probability model Mfor the motif and a model Bfor the background.\nThe model Mwill be the direct product of the position-speci\ufb01c distributions, (i.e.\nthe independent but not identical distribution model), while the back ground model\nBwill be the direct product of a set of relevant background frequen cies (i.e. the\nindependent and identical distribution model). Thus, if falis the frequency of\nresidueaat position lof the motif, and fabackground frequency of the same\nresidue, then the pro\ufb01le score assigned to residue aat position lin a possible\ninstance of the motif will be sal= logfal/fa. These scores are then summed across\nthe positions in the motif, and compared to a suitably de\ufb01ned thresh old. Note\nthat proper setting of the threshold requires a set of data in which all instances\nof the motif are known. The false positive and false negative rate co uld then be\nBiological Sequence Analysis 101\ndetermined for various thresholds, and a suitable choice made.\nWe brie\ufb02y discuss variants of the log-likelihood ratio scores. In many contexts,\nit will matter little whether a position is occupied by a leucine ( L) rather than an\nisoleucine ( I), as each can evolve in time to or from the other rather more readily\nthan from other residues. Thus it might make sense to modify the sc ores to take\nthis and similar evolutionary patterns into account. Indeed the \ufb01rs t use of pro\ufb01les\ninvolved scores of this kind, using the position speci\ufb01c amino acid distr ibution\nof an alignment of instances of the motif and entries from what are k nown as\nPAMmatrices, which embody patterns of molecular evolution. In addition , the\nbackground distribution of residues may be modelled more detailed ma nner, e.g.\nusing the so-called Dirichlet mixture models.\nIt is also possible to include position-speci\ufb01c scores for insertion and deletion\nof residues, relative to a consensus pattern. When these are use d, the scoring\nbecomes a little more subtle, as the problem is then quite analogous to pairwise\nsequence alignment, but with position dependent scoring paramete rs for matches,\nmismatches, insertions and deletions.\nWe summarise this section by noting that probability has entered into our\ndescription through the use of frequencies, and scores based on them, but so far we\ndo not have global statistical models, at least not ones embodying in sertions and\ndeletions, on which we base our estimation and testing. These are all part of the\nuse of pro\ufb01le HMMs, but \ufb01rst we introduce HMMs.\n5. Hidden Markov models\nHidden Markov models (HMMs) are processes ( St,Ot),t= 1,...,T, whereSt\nis the hidden state and Otthe observation at time t. Their probabilistic evolution\nis constrained by the equations\npr(St|St\u22121,Ot\u22121,St\u22122,Ot\u22122,...) =pr(St|St\u22121),\npr(Ot|St\u22121,Ot\u22121,St\u22122,Ot\u22122,...) =pr(Ot|St,St\u22121).\nThe de\ufb01nitions and basic facts concerning HMMs were laid out in a serie s of beauti-\nful papers by L. E. Baum and colleagues around 1970, see [2] for re ferences. Much\nof their formulation has been used almost unchanged to this day. Ma ny variants\nare now used. For example, the distribution of Omay not depend on previous S,\nor it may also depend on previous Ovalues,\npr(Ot|St,St\u22121,Ot\u22121,...) =pr(Ot|St),or\npr(Ot|St,St\u22121,Ot\u22121,...) =pr(Ot|St,St\u22121,Ot\u22121).\nMost importantly for us below, the times of SandOmay be decoupled, permit-\nting the observation corresponding to state time tto be a string whose length and\ncomposition depends on St(and possibly St\u22121and part or all of the previous ob-\nservations). This is called a hidden semi-Markov or generalized hidden Markov\nmodel.\n102 T. P. Speed\nEarly applications of HMMs were to \ufb01nance, but these were never pu blished,\nto speech recognition, and to modelling ion channels. In the mid-late 1 980s HMMs\nentered genetics and molecular biology, where they are now \ufb01rmly en trenched. One\nof the major reasons for the success of HMMs as stochastic mode ls is the fact that\nalthough they are substantial generalizations of Markov chains, t here are elegant\ndynamic programming algorithms which permit full likelihood calculations in many\ncases of interest. Speci\ufb01cally, there are algorithms which permit th e e\ufb03cient calcu-\nlation of a) pr(sequence |M), where sequence is a sequence of observations and M\nis an HMM; b) the maximum over statesofpr(states|sequence,M ), where statesis\ntheunobservedstatesequenceunderlyingtheobservation sequence ; andc)themax-\nimum likelihood estimates of parameters in M based on the observation sequence .\nStep c) is carried out by an iterative procedure which in the case of in dependent\nstates was later termed the EM algorithm.\n6. Pro\ufb01le HMMs\nIn a landmark paper A. Krogh, D. Haussler and co-workers introdu ced pro\ufb01le\nHMMs into bioinformatics. An illustrative form of their pro\ufb01le HMM arch itecture\nis given in Figure 3. There we depict the underlying state space of the hidden\nFigure 3: State space of a simple pro\ufb01le HMM\nMarkov chain of a pro\ufb01le HMM of length 4, with Mdenoting matchstates,Iinsert\nstates and Ddeletestates, while BandEarebeginandendstates, respectively.\nEncircled states ( D,BandE) do not emit observations, while each of the match\nand insert states will have position-speci\ufb01c observation or emission distributions.\nFinally, each arrow will have associated transition probabilities, with t he expecta-\ntion being that the horizontal transition probabilities are typically ne ar unity. This\nthe chain proceeds from left to right, and if it remains within match st ates, its\noutput will be an amino acid sequence of length 4. Deviation to the inse rt or delete\nstates will modify the output accordingly. The similarity with a direct p roduct of\na sequence of position-speci\ufb01c distributions should be unmistakeab le. The pro\ufb01le\nHMMs in use now have considerably more features, while sharing the b asicM,I\nandDarchitecture.\nBiological Sequence Analysis 103\nWhy was the introduction of the HMM formalism such an advance? The\nanswer is simple: it permitted the construction and application of pro \ufb01les to be\nconducted entirely within a formal statistical framework, and tha t really helped.\nInstances of the motif embodied in an HMM could be identi\ufb01ed by calcula ting\npr(sequence |M)/pr(sequence |B) as was done with pro\ufb01les, using the algorithm for\nproblem a) in X above. Instances of the motif could be aligned to the H MM by\ncalculating the most probable state sequence giving rise to the motif sequence, in\nessence \ufb01nding the most probable sequence of matches, insertion s, deletions which\nalign the given sequence to the others which gave rise to the HMM, cf . problem b)\nabove. And \ufb01nally, the parametersin the HMMs couldbe estimated fr om data com-\nprising known instances of the motif by using maximum likelihood, an impo rtant\nstep for many reasons, one being that it put insert and delete scor es on precisely the\nsame footing as match and mismatch scores. Although the estimatio n of HMM pa-\nrameters is easiest if the example sequences are properly aligned, t he EM algorithm\n(problem c) above) does not require aligned sequences.\nIn the years since the introduction of pro\ufb01le HMMs, they have been become\nthe standard approach to representing motifs and protein domain s. The database\nPfam (http://pfam.wustl.edu ) now has 3,849 hidden Markov models (May 2002)\nrepresenting recognized protein or DNA domains or motifs. Pro\ufb01le H MMs have es-\nsentiallyreplacedtheuseofregularexpressionsandtheoriginalpr o\ufb01lesforsearching\nother databases to \ufb01nd novel instances of a motif, for \ufb01nding a mo tif or domain\nmatch to an input sequence, and for aligning a motif or domain to a an e xisting\nfamily. There is considerable evidence that the HMM-based searche s are more pow-\nerful than the older pro\ufb01le based ones, though they are slower co mputationally, and\nat times that is an important consideration.\n7. Finding genes in DNA sequence\nIdentifying genes in DNA sequence is one of the most challenging, inte resting\nand important problems in bioinformatics today. With so many genome s being\nsequenced so rapidly, and the experimental veri\ufb01cation of genes la gging far behind,\nit is necessary to rely on computationally derived genes in order to ma ke immediate\nuse of the sequence.\nWhat is a gene? Most readers will have heard of the famous central dogma\nof molecular biology, in which the hereditary material of an organism r esides in its\ngenome, usually DNA, and where genes are expressed in a two-stag e process: \ufb01rst\nDNA istranscribed into a messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence, and later a processed\nform of this sequence is translated into an amino acid sequence, i.e. a protein. In\ngeneral the transcribed sequence is longer than the translated p ortion: parts called\nintrons (intervening sequence) are removed, leaving exons (expr essed sequence), of\nwhich only some are expressed, while the rest remain untranslated. The translated\nsequence comes in triples called codons, beginning and ending with a un ique start\n(ATG) and one of three stop (TAA, TAG, TGA) codons. There are a lso character-\nistic intron-exon boundaries called splice donor and acceptor sites, and a variety of\nother motifs: promoters, transcription start sites, polyA sites, branching sites, and\n104 T. P. Speed\nso on.\nAll of the foregoing have statistical characterizations, and in prin ciple they\ncan all help identify genes in long otherwise unannotated DNA sequen ce segments.\nTo get an idea of the magnitude of the task with the human genome, c onsider the\nfollowing facts about human gene sequences [5]: the coding regions c omprise about\n1.5% of the entire genome; the average gene length is about 27,000 b p (base pair);\nthe average total coding region is 1,340 bp; and the average intron length is about\n3,300 bp. Further, only about 8% of genes have a single exon. We see that the\ninformation in human genes is very dispersed along the genome, and t hat in general\nthe parts of primary interest, the coding exons, are a relatively sm all fraction of the\ngene, on average about1\n20.\n8. Generalized HMMs for \ufb01nding genes\nThe HMMs which are e\ufb00ective in \ufb01nding genes are the generalized HMMs\n(GHMMs) described in section 5. above. Space does not permit our g iving an ad-\nequate description here, so we simply outline the architecture of Ge nscan [1] one\nof the most widely used human gene\ufb01nders. States represent the gene features\nwe mentioned above: exon, intron, and of course intergenic region , and a variety of\nother features (promotor, untranslated region, polyA site, and so on. Output obser-\nvations embody state-dependent nucleotide composition, depend ence, and speci\ufb01c\nsignal features (such as stop codons). In a GHMM the state duration needs to be\nmodelled, as well as two other important features of genes in DNA: t hereading\nframe, which corresponds to the triples along the mRNA sequence which ar e se-\nquentially translated, and the strand, as DNA is double stranded, and genes can be\non either strand, i.e. they can point in either direction. These featu res can be seen\nin Figure 4, which was kindly supplied by Lior Pachter.\nThe output of a GHMM gene\ufb01nder after processing a genomic segme nt is\nbroadlysimilartothat fromapro\ufb01leHMM afterprocessinganaminoac idsequence:\nthe most probable state sequence given an observation sequence is a best gene\nannotation of that sequence, and a variety of probabilities can be c alculated to\nindicate the support in the observation sequence for various spec i\ufb01c gene features.\n9. Comparative sequence analysis using HMMs\nThe large number of sequenced genomes now available, and the obse rvation\nthatfunctionallyimportantregionsareevolutionarilyconserved,h asledtoe\ufb00ortsto\nincorporate conservation into the models and methods of biological sequence anal-\nysis. Pair HMMs were introduced in [2] as a way of including alignment pro blems\nunder the HMM framework, and recently [4] they were combined with GHMMs\n(forming GPHMMs) to carry out alignment and gene\ufb01nding with homolo gous seg-\nments of the mouse and human genomes. Use of the program SLAM o n the whole\nBiological Sequence Analysis 105\nFigure 4: Forward half of the Genscan GHMM state space\nmousegenome( http://bio.math.berkeley.edu/slam/mouse/ ) demonstrated the\nvalue of GPHMMs in this context.\n10. Challenges in biological sequence analysis\nThe \ufb01rst challenge is to understand the biology well enough to begin b iological\nsequence analysis. This part will frequently involve collaborations wit h biologists.\nWith HMMs, GHMMs and GPHMMs, designing the underlying architectur e, and\ncarryingoutthe modelling forthe componentsparts, e.g. for splice sitesin gene\ufb01nd-\ningGHMM is perhapsthe next majorchallenge. Undoubtedly the hard est andmost\nimportant task of all is the implementation: coding up the algorithms a nd making\nit all work with error-prone and incomplete sequence data. Finally, it is usually a\nreal challenge to \ufb01nd good data sets for calibrating and evaluating t he algorithms,\nand for carrying out studies of competing algorithms.\nForarecentexampleofthisprocess,whichisamodelofitskind, see [3]. There\nan HMM is presented for the so-called \u03c3Arecognition sites, which involve two DNA\nmotifs separated by a variable number of base pairs. In addition to t he examples\nmentioned so far, there are many more HMMs in the bioinformatics lite rature, see\np. 79 of [2] for ones published before 1998.\n11. Closing remarks\n106 T. P. Speed\nIn this short survey of biological sequence analysis, I have simply to uched on\nsomeofthe majorideas. Amuchmorecomprehensivetreatment of materialcovered\nhere can be found in the book [2], whose title not coincidentally is the sa me as\nthat of this paper. Many important ideas from biological sequence a nalysis have\nnot been mentioned here, including molecular evolution and phylogene tic inference,\nand the use of stochastic context-free grammars, a form of gen eralization of HMMs\nsuited to the analysis of RNA sequence data.\nAt this Congress I have talked (and am now writing) on the research of others,\nin an area in which my own contributions have been negligible. I chose to do so\nupon being honoured by the invitation to speak at this Congress bec ause I believe\nthis topic \u2013 HMMs \u2013 to be one of the great success stories of applying mathematics\nto bioinformatics. In my view it is the one most worthy of a wider mathe matical\naudience. I hope that the fact that there are many others bette r suited than me to\nspeak on this topic will not prevent readers from appreciating it and following it up\nthrough the bibliography.\nI owe what understanding I have of this \ufb01eld to collaborations and dis cussions\nwith a number of people, and I would like to acknowledge them here.

This leads to rela-\ntivelyslow thermalizationofa gyroscopicdegreeoffreedo m.\nRelaxation is mainly due to van der Waals interaction with\nthermalizing walls. As far as the interaction potential, th e\nLennard\u2013Jones potential, decreases as r\u22126and walls\u2019 inner\nsurface grows as r2, the overall van der Waals contribution\nvaries approximately as r\u22124.

MOLECULARGYROSCOPE\nA long lifetime of angular modes is the sole serious ideal-\nization underlying the mechanism of ion interference.

A \u2018vicious circle\u2019\noccurs which one could not leave without having to substan-\ntially change the model itself. Thus, despite the obvious ad -\nvantages of the ion-in-capsule model, namely, simplicity a nd\na high forecasting skill, we have to recognize its limitatio ns\nandseek forothersolutions.\n3\nr\n\u03b1dLKF\n/G25/G24\nL0\u03d5/G11\nFIG.2: Forces,momentsofforces,andangularmomentainrot ation\nof a gyro.\nOne of them hinges on the use of conservation laws in the\ndynamics of rotating solids.
